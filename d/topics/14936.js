Reasons for errors include human fallibility, medical complexity, system deficiencies, and defensive barriers. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine estimated that medical errors account for up to 98,000 deaths each year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although there are more than 4 million hospitalizations related to childbirth in the United States each year, there is a paucity of data specifically addressing medical errors in obstetrics. Nevertheless, medical errors do not spare this population and it is likely that strategies to reduce these errors would benefit pregnant women and their children.</p><p>Strategies to reduce errors and subsequent adverse outcomes have focused on team and individual training; simulations and drills; development of protocols, guidelines and checklists; use of information technology; and education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These activities and tools apply to inpatient and office settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although most studies describe positive reactions among participants and improvements in knowledge, skills, and behavior, data on patient outcomes after clinician-training programs are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Simulation training, specifically as it relates to shoulder dystocia management and performance of operative vaginal delivery, has shown the most promise for improving clinical outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TEAMWORK TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failures in teamwork and communication account for 70 percent of sentinel events in obstetrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Recognizing this, the Joint Commission, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Institute of Medicine all acknowledge that <span class=\"nowrap\">teamwork/communication</span> is a critical element of patient safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>In a labor and delivery setting, the patient and her baby are not cared for solely by her obstetric providers, but also by nurses, anesthesia and pediatric providers, and support staff. Formal teamwork training is increasingly becoming a part of the orientation of new hospital staff members, with the goal of improving teamwork and communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. There is some evidence (reviewed below) that formal training in these concepts will improve patient safety, team performance, and maternal-fetal outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Training methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of training methods and evaluation tools has been developed and studied, which makes generalization of results difficult. Two of the better-known methods are:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25498781\"><span class=\"h3\">Medteams training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MedTeams training is an adaptation of a program used for training emergency department personnel and is based on aviation crew resource management principles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Crew resource management has been defined as a management system that makes optimum use of all available resources: equipment, procedures, and people, to promote safety and enhance the efficiency of flight operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The core concepts of this training program are communication, situation monitoring, mutual support, and leadership [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Communication</strong>&mdash; defined techniques for communication of relevant patient information, conflict resolution, verbalizing safety concerns, and ensuring messages are correctly understood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Situation monitoring</strong>&mdash; the process of scanning the labor and delivery landscape to observe and monitor patients' care plans, other team members' behaviors, or the environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mutual support</strong>&mdash; the development of the interdependence that is crucial for teams to function well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leadership</strong>&mdash; designating and clarifying the roles and responsibilities of team members, reallocating resources to balance workload, ensuring that team meetings, huddles, briefings, and debriefings occur, helping team members resolve interpersonal or cognitive conflicts.</p><p/><p>A criticism of the MedTeams approach is its reliance upon the concept of crew resource management at the exclusion of other aspects of team training science.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25498790\"><span class=\"h3\">Team STEPPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A more inclusive teamwork training program, TeamSTEPPS&reg; (Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety), was created to address this criticism and has been implemented at many military hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is currently implementing TeamSTEPPS training nationwide (<a href=\"http://teamstepps.ahrq.gov/&amp;token=jh0wiRUBUU6YtfGLvGgoA66OOXIsjUaxYq5GLN18CukjURkR198fvgOX5ELBw7BW&amp;TOPIC_ID=4463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://teamstepps.ahrq.gov</a>). A network of trainers is being created to provide national access to this course. There are no trials on the impact of TeamSTEPPS training in reducing adverse obstetrical outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstetrical outcomes of teamwork training studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following studies represent the available evidence illustrating the modest effects of teamwork training on pregnancy outcome:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25498797\"><span class=\"h3\">Department of Defense randomized trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Department of Defense evaluated the effect of teamwork training on adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in 15 military and civilian hospitals with a combined total of over 53,000 deliveries annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The intervention group consisted of 1307 labor and delivery personnel randomly assigned to MedTeams training; personnel assigned to the no training group served as controls. Outcomes were recorded before, and five months after, the teamwork training intervention.</p><p>The composite maternal and neonatal outcome measure, the Adverse Outcome Index (AOI), was defined as the number of patients with one or more adverse outcomes divided by the total number of deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Adverse maternal outcomes recorded included maternal death, uterine rupture, unplanned admission to an intensive care unit, unplanned return to the operating room, blood transfusion, and third- or fourth-degree vaginal laceration. Adverse neonatal outcomes recorded included intrapartum death of a fetus weighing at least 500 g at 24 or more weeks of gestation, death within seven days of birth of a baby with birth weight of at least 2500 g, neonatal birth trauma, unplanned admission of a term baby to the intensive care nursery, and five-minute Apgar score of less than 7 in a term baby. Additionally, teamwork was measured using 11 process measures that evaluated length of stay and delays in action where multiple care providers were involved.</p><p>In both the intervention and control groups, outcomes of approximately 4000 deliveries before training were used for baseline comparisons and 10,000 deliveries after training (or no training) were used for the post-intervention evaluation. There were no differences in baseline characteristics or outcomes between the groups. Major findings of the trial were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the individual maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes or in the composite AOI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 11 process measures evaluated, the only significant difference between groups was that the intervention group had a reduction in the time from decision to proceed with immediate cesarean delivery to the time of incision, which fell from 33 minutes to 21 minutes. The investigators attributed this finding to the formation of contingency teams (obstetric and anesthesia attending physicians, obstetric chief resident, labor nurse and surgical scrub nurse) at the hospitals that received teamwork training and concluded the reduction in decision-to-incision time of 10 minutes may have clinical significance.</p><p/><p>The lead civilian hospital in the trial discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] subsequently implemented a modified version of the original MedTeams teamwork training curriculum for all of their labor and delivery staff and then compared the AOI for the three years prior to program implementation with the AOI four years after implementation; the year that the processes were instituted was excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After universal teamwork training, the AOI decreased from 5.9 to 4.6 percent, which represented 300 fewer women experiencing an adverse event. The number of high-severity malpractice claims fell from 13 to 5 cases. Actual incurred indemnity was not addressed.</p><p>The investigators suggested that the improvement in outcomes in their study (in contrast to the findings of the original multi-center trial) may have been due to the longer length of follow-up, the creation of other protocols not related to teamwork training, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> better integration of the teamwork training into practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25498804\"><span class=\"h3\">Observational studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In another study, a large academic hospital instituted a comprehensive safety strategy including creation of standardized protocols, teamwork training, and training in the interpretation of fetal heart rate monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. They also used the AOI to evaluate composite outcome.</p><p>After the intervention, the AOI decreased significantly and a provider survey reported significant improvement in the safety climate (ie, the sum of employee perceptions regarding overall safety within the workplace). However, there were no significant improvements in the individual outcomes comprising the AOI, other than a decrease in episiotomy rate (which has been falling worldwide anyway). The cesarean delivery rate increased over the study period (as it has worldwide). A limitation of this study was that there were no means to determine which of the several safety interventions performed may have led to the modest improvement in outcomes.</p><p>In a subsequent study that evaluated a combination of Medteams and simulation training on a labor and delivery unit, a reduction in an adverse outcomes index was observed at 18 months follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Team performance evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Objectively evaluating team performance is a critical step in determining the effect of any teamwork training program. Despite modest evidence that teamwork training improves patient safety, it is gaining in popularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/6,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17-19</a>]. Further research is needed to determine whether, and what type of, training actually reduces adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and the combination of medical didactic training, teamwork theory, and simulation experience that will be most effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The following studies have attempted to create a useful means for objective measurement of teamwork in an obstetrical setting, but results have been conflicting. Of note, all of the studies used some sort of rating scale, but none evaluated patient outcomes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated two tools for rating teamwork in four obstetrical emergency scenarios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The first evaluation tool, the Human Factors Rating Scale (HFRS), adapted the Operating Room Management Attitudes' Questionnaire (ORMAQ) to obstetric scenarios. It consisted of a 45 item survey with questions on the themes of leadership-structure, confidence-assertion, information sharing, teamwork, and error. The second evaluation tool consisted of a single five-point rating scale, the Global Rating Scale (GRS), to judge overall team performance. Descriptions of each level of performance along the five-point scale were provided.<br/><br/>These tools were evaluated by having teams complete four obstetrical emergency scenarios and then each team member used both evaluation tools (HFRS and GRS) to evaluate the team's performance. Nine external raters used the same evaluation tools to rate the teams. There was good inter-observer reliability among team members and among external raters; however, the correlation between the two groups was poor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The investigators concluded that the HFRS did not adequately differentiate the difficulty of the individual scenarios. The GRS better identified the more difficult scenarios, but was too simple to separate performance in the various domains of team performance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another group created a teamwork evaluation tool using principles of crew resource management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The tool, called the Clinical Teamwork Scale (CTS), evaluates 15 items in the domains of communication, situational awareness, decision making, role responsibility, and patient friendliness. To validate this tool, three evaluators used the CTS to evaluate teams performing a shoulder dystocia drill, comparing their performance to recordings demonstrating good, average and excellent teamwork. The investigators concluded that the CTS demonstrated good construct validity, usability, and inter-rater reliability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A British group evaluated team performance in a standardized eclampsia drill before and after eclampsia management training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although all of the teams received training in eclampsia management, only half of the teams were randomly assigned to also receive formal training in teamwork theory, either at their local hospital or at a regional simulation center. Teamwork performance was evaluated using a validated global rating scale (5-point Likert) to rate areas of knowledge, behavior and overall performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].<br/><br/>Teamwork improved in all groups after eclampsia management training, but there was no additional benefit noted in those groups that also received teamwork training. The investigators suggested that the apparent lack of benefit of formal teamwork training may have been due to inadequate training in teamwork issues. It is also possible that simply receiving eclampsia education and rehearsing the eclampsia drill was sufficient to improve teamwork because of the relatively straightforward nature of eclampsia management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This conclusion was supported by a separate analysis of the participants' change in medical knowledge before and after training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Medical knowledge was assessed using a 185 question, multiple-choice questionnaire, administered one to three weeks before the training and again one to three weeks afterwards. All of the teams had a 20-point increase in test scores after eclampsia education and drill training, but there was no difference between the teams with and without teamwork training.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SIMULATION AND DRILLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simulation of obstetrical procedures has become a common method of training individuals and teams to improve technical skills for treating emergency situations that occur infrequently. By simulating these situations, teams can learn and practice the required interventions in a safe environment, and thus potentially improve patient outcome when these situations actually occur on the labor unit. Simulation can also identify individual and team weaknesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Observations of many providers performing the same simulation can reveal the most common mistakes, allowing for development of appropriate and efficient curriculum for future training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Lastly, simulation can augment the perceived reduction in clinical experience due to mandated reductions in resident work hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) proposed a series of obstetric scenarios amenable to simulation training and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine&rsquo;s simulation subcommittee developed a classification system for the characterization of evidence for simulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In general, the available data consistently show simulation training and drills improve performance by various measures, but there is less evidence for improvement in maternal or neonatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>The results of simulation drills in specific common obstetrical emergencies are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Eclampsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eclampsia simulation has offered insights into individual, team, and system errors that can be prevented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Realism can be added to the simulation of eclampsia and hemorrhage with modifications of commonly used models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>As an example, a study performed in the United Kingdom compared team performance before and after eclampsia drill training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Teams were randomly assigned to training at their local hospital or in a regional simulation center. After training, the teams completed more of the basic tasks required in the management of eclamptic patients and these tasks were completed more quickly than prior to training. There were no differences between the teams trained locally or at a simulation center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Shoulder dystocia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency with the potential for serious neonatal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maternal adverse outcome. It is usually unpredictable and unpreventable. Improper management of this emergency may worsen neonatal outcome, highlighting the need for adequate training of providers.</p><p>The infrequent nature and special skills needed to manage shoulder dystocia combine to make it an obstetrical emergency ideally suited for simulation. Also, there are evidence-based recommendations for the proper selection, sequence, and technique of maneuvers used to resolve shoulder dystocia; these recommendations can be used to develop training programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated improvement in management and documentation of a simulated shoulder dystocia event after training of residents and attending physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Both low- and high-fidelity simulation of shoulder dystocia improved performance in the simulated event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, there are no studies evaluating post-training team performance during actual patient events.</p><p>Neonatal outcomes after team simulation training have been evaluated. In three studies, the frequency of brachial plexus injury associated with shoulder dystocia fell by at least two-thirds after training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study compared shoulder dystocia management and neonatal outcomes in the four years before versus after institution of a training program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Training consisted of didactic and practical training on risk factors, diagnosis, and proper management of shoulder dystocia. The rate of shoulder dystocia was similar during both periods (approximately 2 percent), but neonatal brachial plexus injury fell significantly from 9.3 percent to 2.3 percent. A significant improvement was noted in use of appropriate management techniques (McRoberts' position, suprapubic pressure, internal rotation maneuvers, delivery of the posterior arm) and a significant decrease was also noted in inappropriate techniques (no recognized maneuvers performed, excessive traction, fundal pressure). Before training, the use of at least one correct maneuver was documented in only 49 percent of deliveries, versus 92 percent of deliveries after training. A subsequent 12-year follow up study reported a sustained reduction in brachial plexus injury at birth: <span class=\"nowrap\">24/324</span> (7.4 percent, p &lt;.01) pre-training, <span class=\"nowrap\">6/262</span> (2.3 percent) early after training, and <span class=\"nowrap\">7/562</span> (1.3 percent) late after training. The authors concluded that there are significant benefits to long-term, embedded training programs with improvements in management and outcomes. Importantly, a decade after the introduction of simulation training there were no cases of brachial plexus injury lasting over 12 months in 562 cases of shoulder dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>However, another study did not find a significant reduction in brachial plexus injuries after team training and use of simulators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The authors postulated that this may be because many of these injuries are not due to excessive traction by the clinician, and therefore not modifiable by clinician training. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative vaginal delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operative vaginal delivery, specifically forceps delivery, is another area in which simulation training has been associated with improved clinical outcomes. Many residents do not feel competent in the performance of a forceps delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. It is likely that this accounts for at least a portion of the increasing number of cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Adequate training in forceps delivery is likely going to require simulation for a number of reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The number of faculty capable of teaching the use of forceps is declining; teaching the proper use of obstetric forceps in the clinical setting is difficult because they are primarily used in urgent or emergent situations, and the key maneuvers of blade placement by the learner are done in the vagina, thus the teacher is blind to whether placement is correct until it is complete.</p><p>To overcome these obstacles, one group of investigators created a forceps simulation system using blades implanted with position sensors, allowing real-time and post-simulation evaluation of blade trajectory during placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Based on objective assessment of blade trajectory and repeatability of insertion technique, the investigators found that senior obstetricians performed forceps placements in an &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;very good,&quot; or &quot;good&quot; manner 92 percent of the time, compared to only 38 percent of the time for junior obstetricians. They also observed that residents' skills progressed with more training, showing less hesitation and better following of a trajectory modeled by an expert operator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Another study evaluated the effect of operative vaginal delivery training on maternal and neonatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Training sessions with a senior staff member included lecture, video, and a &quot;doll and pelvis&quot; model. Materials were also provided for later individual study. This training emphasized techniques to minimize maternal and neonatal injury and to reduce the number of failed instrumental deliveries. Operative vaginal delivery rates were 11 percent before, and 14 percent after, the training period, similar to the overall rate of operative vaginal delivery in the United States. A comparison between outcomes for all operative vaginal deliveries in the four months after initiation of the training program with that of a historical control group reported no statistically significant difference in the incidence of failed forceps or vacuum delivery or maternal anal sphincter injury. There was, however, a significant reduction in neonatal admissions to a special care nursery and in neonatal scalp and facial injuries. The investigators theorized that the improvement in neonatal outcome may have been largely due to better understanding of the correct technique of vacuum delivery, given that this was the more commonly used method.</p><p>In a different study, implementation of forceps simulation curriculum for residents in training demonstrated a 22 percent decrease in severe maternal perineal lacerations.

The educational intervention included the American Heart Association Basic Life Support training followed by a didactic session focusing on the management of cardiac arrest during pregnancy. Participants then participated in a simulation session with immediate feedback, completed a multiple choice test, and took a confidence survey. Postintervention evaluation three weeks later showed significant improvement in simulation performance, knowledge and confidence. Significant improvements occurred in timely initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (median 32 versus 120 seconds) and timely initiation of cesarean delivery (median time 159 versus 240 seconds). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of simulators has been demonstrated to improve performance of amniocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] and vaginal breech delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>A retrospective study investigated the benefit of a structured training course on neonatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

The training session included a 40-minute practical workshop on shoulder dystocia management. Participants, including junior and senior physicians and midwives, performed a simulated delivery with a shoulder dystocia. The simulation ended when the participant delivered the posterior arm, elected to stop, or five minutes had elapsed. They were evaluated on whether delivery was successful, the head-to-body delivery interval, performance of appropriate actions, force applied, and communication.</p><p>Each participant did the simulation once before the training session and at three time points after training. The fetus with shoulder dystocia was successfully delivered in 49 percent of simulations before training, and in 82, 84, and 85 percent of simulations at 3 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after training, respectively. Additional training of the 18 percent of participants who were unable to deliver the fetus 3 weeks after training resulted in a 79 percent rate of successful delivery in this group at 12 months.</p><p>The investigators concluded that annual training is adequate for providers demonstrating competency after initial training. However, those that were unsuccessful three weeks after training should have remediation and be followed more closely to ensure retention of skills. This study also highlights the fact that providers do not all learn in the same way or at the same rate and that to achieve maximal benefit, some individualization of simulation training is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3276656798\"><span class=\"h2\">Implementation of simulation programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the evidence for supporting the effectiveness of simulation and patient safety practices has increased, the ability to implement programs to positively impact clinical outcomes across multiple clinical sites and institutions is lacking. A group of five academic medical centers and affiliated hospitals identified key components for successfully initiating and implementing a shoulder dystocia simulation program, which included: involvement of clinician and nursing leadership from each academic medical center, administrative and logistic support from a liability insurer, development of consensus on curriculum components of simulation curriculum, conduct of a gap and barrier analysis, financial support from insurer to close necessary gaps and mitigate barriers, and creation of dashboards and tracking program performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CHECKLISTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Checklists are available from several sources, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Patient-Safety-Checklists&amp;token=QzJAKvSZnpN58yaNGpVtqxWDn6LjvzldcmXluwxFZ+Jm4iIM3CKIjFXuNOp9ge7iVEzFCyF0f4PoRRkHE4Rqejp5jxipevNHkCVeHG8wP4Y=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> (ACOG, patient safety checklists)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.jointcommission.org/safe_surgery_checklist&amp;token=mXmq0ptUSHW1aBgC4uB4fntnHt83YdMjpAgiYrcyJTGYWGGIARV5dIgBXIa1OX4FTDKc8/ULwBbUZwp8FiskPg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Joint Commission</a> (safe surgery checklist)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxytocin administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxytocin</a> is a commonly used medication to stimulate labor. While many dose regimens have been evaluated, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a dosing protocol that is appropriate for all patients. The best dose regimen likely varies among patients or types of patients. It is possible, however, that more uniform practice could improve safety. Some experts recommend oxytocin protocols, which emphasize strict maternal and fetal criteria when administering the medication, the use of low initial doses with infrequent dose increases, and strong collaboration between physicians and nurses. Adherence to protocols and checklists may reduce medicolegal risk, while establishing <span class=\"nowrap\">protocols/checklists</span> and then violating them may increase that risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>].</p><p>A large hospital corporation published data on the effects of implementing a checklist-based system for use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. They purposely created a &quot;conservative&quot; protocol with the intention that a standing order could be safely implemented by nurses of all skill levels. The pre-oxytocin checklist required adequate documentation that the patient was an appropriate candidate for labor (appropriate estimated fetal weight, fetal presentation, clinical pelvimetry, fetal assessment, etc). An &quot;in-use&quot; oxytocin checklist included fetal assessment by heart rate pattern and uterine assessment by pattern and strength of contractions (either by palpation or with an intrauterine pressure catheter); this checklist was to be completed every 30 minutes while the patient received the medication. If all of the items on the checklist could not be completed, then the oxytocin infusion was reduced or stopped. The infusion could be restarted if both the pre-oxytocin and in-use checklist were completed.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of the checklist, the investigators compared the outcomes of 100 patients in one hospital who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> just before implementation of the checklist-based protocol to the outcome of 100 patients who received oxytocin just after implementation of the checklist. The groups were similar at baseline and had a similar total duration of oxytocin infusion. There were no differences between groups in cesarean delivery rates or specific adverse neonatal outcomes (intensive care nursery admission, respiratory distress, sepsis suspected or confirmed). There was a clinically negligible, but statistically significant, reduction in maximum oxytocin dose from 13.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> to 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> and a reduction in the total number of neonates with any adverse outcome, which fell from 31 to 18 neonates.</p><p>Based on the perceived success of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> checklist, the same hospital corporation instituted similar checklists for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>, the performance of operative vaginal delivery, and the management of shoulder dystocia and abnormal fetal heart rate tracings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reducing-adverse-obstetrical-outcomes-through-safety-sciences/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. They subsequently observed a decrease in litigation, as well as a one-year reduction in the cesarean delivery rate. No further data were provided about maternal or neonatal outcome. Ascribing all of the positive outcomes to implementation of checklists may not be warranted, as the hospital corporation employed several other initiatives during this period, such as increased physician presence in the hospitals.

The guidelines were promulgated via departmental conferences, distribution of reading materials, and instructional posters.</p><p>The investigators reviewed outcomes for the nine months before the intervention began and for the first nine months afterwards. After the training and guidelines were initiated, there was a significant increase in the use of vacuum rather than forceps and a significant reduction in the frequency of third and fourth decree lacerations related to operative vaginal deliveries, from 41 percent to 26 percent. Among these patients, the incidence of fourth-degree lacerations decreased from 30 to 19 percent.

Limited published data in other specialties have found a neutral or negative effect. Potential concerns about the increased work hour restrictions raised in these studies include a decrease in continuity of care and an increased number of handoffs.
