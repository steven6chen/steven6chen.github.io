IgA is a type of protein known as an &quot;antibody&quot; that helps the body fight infections. &quot;Nephropathy&quot; is the term doctors use to describe a problem with the kidneys.</p><p>The kidneys filter blood and get rid of waste and excess salt and water in the body. IgA nephropathy damages the kidneys so they don't work well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618382\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of IgA nephropathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with the condition have no symptoms. But some people notice blood in their urine. This can happen just once or many times. People who have bloody urine usually get it after a cold or sore throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618397\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for IgA nephropathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Other tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p>If these tests show you have kidney damage, your doctor might do a test called a &quot;kidney biopsy.&quot; For this test, he or she takes a small sample of tissue from your kidney to look at under the microscope. Usually, the doctor will get this sample by inserting a needle straight through the skin in the back and into the kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618412\"><span class=\"h1\">How is IgA nephropathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your blood and urine tests show that your kidneys are not damaged, you might not need treatment. But you should get blood and urine tests at least once a year to check how well your kidneys are working.</p><p>If your blood or urine tests show signs of kidney damage, you might need to take medicines. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers &ndash; These medicines lower blood pressure and help protect the kidney from further damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Statins &ndash; These medicines lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. That's important because people with kidney damage have a high risk of these problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids &ndash; These medicines help reduce inflammation in the kidneys. That's important because inflammation can cause scars to form in the kidneys.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fish oil &ndash; This fish oil is different from the fish oil you can get at a health food store. The fish oil you get from your doctor is prescription-strength fish oil. It might help reduce inflammation in the kidneys.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618427\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have IgA nephropathy but do not have signs of kidney damage, your risk of having problems during pregnancy is only slightly higher than that of a woman without the condition. But if your kidneys show signs of damage, pregnancy can be dangerous for both you and your baby. The more damaged your kidneys are, the greater the risk of a problem.</p><p>Also, common medicines to treat IgA nephropathy (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) can cause birth defects. Because of this, women who might get pregnant should not take these medicines.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
