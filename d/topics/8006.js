These include hearing aids, amplified telephones, and portable devices that can be used to amplify the sound coming from electronic systems at public events. Implantable hearing devices (eg, cochlear implants, osseointegrated implants, and electrically driven middle ear implants) are integral in providing hearing for adults in whom traditional hearing amplification devices do not provide adequate hearing.</p><p>Hearing amplification devices for adults are discussed here. Hearing amplification devices for children and the differential diagnosis of hearing loss are discussed separately. The evaluation of hearing loss is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEARING AIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most hearing impairments can be helped with a modern hearing aid. Young, middle-aged, and independent older adults who have hearing difficulties that interfere with work and social interactions, and who are highly motivated to improve their hearing, make excellent candidates for hearing amplification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hearing aids improve hearing-specific health-related quality of life, general health-related quality of life, and listening ability in adults with mild to moderate hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying appropriate candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in providing hearing amplification is for the audiologist, referring clinician, and patient to agree that the patient needs and is likely to benefit from a hearing aid. This mutual decision is based upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The audiogram.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A specific hearing difficulty assessment. Patients with poor results on audiometric word discrimination testing might not achieve significant benefit from a hearing aid. In addition, the method of testing a patient&rsquo;s hearing has evolved because the traditional soundproof testing room does not approximate a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; environment. It was a poor assessment of a patient&rsquo;s true ability to hear. Thus, the addition of background noise is now added to test a patient&rsquo;s ability to hear and understand words and sentences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;, section on 'Speech audiometry'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lifestyle of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's motivation level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A realistic discussion about what a hearing aid can and cannot do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One common misconception is that the aid restores normal hearing just as corrective lenses restore normal vision. Hearing aids do not restore hearing to normal. As a general rule, a hearing aid usually improves hearing by one-half of the loss. As an example, a patient with a 60 dB hearing loss could expect to hear in the 30 dB range with hearing amplification. Thus, the goal of hearing amplification is not to restore normal hearing, but to significantly improve communicative ability and quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age alone is not a factor.</p><p/><p>A study found that digital hearing aids led to equivalent improvement in speech performance in patients with impaired hearing who were over 80 years of age, compared with those 65 to 80 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Unilateral or bilateral hearing aids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Binaural fitting provides the most benefit, including balanced hearing, sound localization, directional hearing, better speech understanding, and better hearing in noisy situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Binaural fitting may not be successful in patients with large hearing asymmetries, or if caring for two hearing aids would be difficult. Patients with financial constraints may benefit more from two simple hearing aids than one more complex device. One hearing aid may be sufficient when hearing loss is minimal, but even patients with unilateral hearing loss should be fitted with a hearing aid, because bilateral hearing is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cosmetic and other issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients would like to avoid anyone knowing that they wear a hearing aid and thus commonly ask for the mini, completely in the canal, or in-the-ear type aids.</p><p>However, not all patients are candidates for this small device. In patients with severe or even significant moderate hearing losses, a behind-the-ear hearing aid may be necessary in order to generate enough power to facilitate better hearing. Additionally, smaller devices will offer fewer features because of size limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Open-mold hearing aids are popular for their non-occlusive fitting and improved performance for high-frequency loss compared with traditional aids. These aids are also small.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Electronic capabilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing aids have differing levels of electronic features. Options include digital or analog compression, and some hearing aids are programmable while others are not. All of these options incur variable cost and benefits.</p><p>Hearing aids specifically designed for patients with high-frequency hearing loss are available that do not have the occlusive effect of conventional hearing aids. A tiny piece fits behind the ear and a thin transparent plastic tube sits slightly in the ear canal. These aids tend to produce less static than conventional aids.</p><p>Advances in electronic technology, such as digital hearing aids, are moving faster than the research to determine the most effective signal-processing method. Improvements in hearing aids now include features such as noise cancellation, wind noise reduction, wireless capabilities, and the ability to assess the environment and automatically determine the best hearing condition for the patient. These advances should provide a better quality of life for the hearing-impaired individual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fitting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing aids should be fit by a licensed and qualified professional to avoid problems with feedback and reliability associated with poor-quality hearing aids. Hearing aids must be properly fit, and digital hearing aids must be properly programmed. Not all dispensers of hearing aids take the time required to do this properly; it may make sense to suggest to patients that they see a licensed audiologist for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A trial period is typically offered, during which the patient uses the hearing aid for 30 days. The cost of the aid is refundable except for a modest fitting fee.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H885659354\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers to use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less than one-half of the older adult population with significant hearing impairment, who would benefit from hearing amplification, actually wears a hearing aid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In a report using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), only one in seven individuals 50 years and older with hearing loss uses a hearing aid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In another study, only 20 percent of adults between the ages of 55 and 74 who would benefit from using a hearing aid actually used one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A systematic review estimated that anywhere from 5 to 40 percent of patients with a hearing aid do not use them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Reasons cited for these low numbers include lack of appreciation of the consequences of hearing loss, discomfort, absence of insurance reimbursement, and fear of social stigmatization. In some older individuals, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, or inability to adapt to using new technology may also play a role. This occurs despite the fact that part of the social withdrawal may be due to frustration with the inability to hear. An observational study found that scores on a depression scale improved at six months, compared with baseline, in older adults who were hearing aid recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Most of these individuals without severe hearing impairment would benefit from a hearing aid trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A 2014 review of 32 studies evaluating interventions to improve hearing aid use did not find any interventions that consistently improved use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE CONDUCTION HEARING DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain patients who are unable to benefit from standard air conduction hearing devices (a conventional hearing aid) may benefit from a device that transmits sound directly through the skull. Bone conduction hearing aids can be held against the skull with a steel-spring headband; however, this is typically painful, cumbersome, produces skull deformities, and does not achieve good-quality hearing.</p><p>By contrast, an implantable bone conduction hearing aid has significant advantages. The main implantable system available is a bone-anchored prosthetic device known as Baha. A small titanium implant is inserted into the skull where it osteointegrates. An abutment is attached to the implant such that a small portion of the abutment sticks out through the skin and forms a snap attachment point for a removable bone conduction hearing aid. Alternatively, a magnetic abutment can be attached, which is under the skin. The sound processor connects to this abutment with another magnet on the outside of the skin, both of which are removed when not in use. The sound quality is far superior to that of traditional bone conduction hearing aids, and there is no pain or discomfort.</p><p>Potential indications for such an implantable system include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital atresia of the ear canal such that it does not exist or cannot accommodate a standard hearing aid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic infection of the middle or outer ear that is exacerbated by a standard hearing aid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic reactions to standard hearing aids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-sided deafness as may occur after removal of an acoustic neuroma, from trauma, or from a viral or vascular insult</p><p/><p>A case series report in patients with single-sided deafness demonstrated improved speech discrimination with a bone-anchored hearing aid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER AMPLIFICATION DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apart from hearing aids, other devices are available to amplify sounds for patients with hearing loss. These include amplified telephones and portable amplification systems. These latter use infrared technology to send sound to a headset from an external source, such as the audio output from a television set or the sound system in a public theater or church [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Emerging technology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progress in wireless and digital chip technology, combined with advances in cognitive and medical science, promise the potential for greater individualization of devices to improve hearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Improvements in directional microphone technology allow isolation of desired sounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Studies are ongoing of hearing aids that are surgically implanted in the middle ear. One device, the Esteem, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for severe hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is only offered in a limited number of centers, is not covered by insurance, and is expensive. Other devices are not yet available to the general public. Long-term efficacy of these devices is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but the reoperation rate is over 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A new type of hearing aid (Lyric) is placed on the eardrum by a clinician and replaced every three to four months. It is available only in select areas, and it is costly; its effectiveness is still to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">COCHLEAR IMPLANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cochlear implants are surgically implanted prosthetic devices that use electrical stimulation to provide hearing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70810 \">figure 1</a>). The criteria for selecting cochlear implantation include moderate to severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and a patient who still struggles to hear and understand despite appropriately fit hearing aids. Some surgeons also offer cochlear implants to patients with unilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss, with or without tinnitus.</p><p>Cochlear implant candidates do not need to be totally deaf. Indeed, most patients have some hearing and the sentence recognition scores can be up to 60 percent in best aided conditions.</p><p>The benefits and risks of cochlear implants in adults are generally similar to those in children. A meta-analysis of 42 studies concluded that cochlear implants in adults provided significant benefit and increase in quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Studies have also suggested that cochlear implants are safe and have benefits for older adult patients (&ge;70 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-treatment#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Cochlear implants'</a>.)</p><p>Differences between cochlear implants in children and adults include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best candidates for cochlear implants are postlingual (had speech and language skills before losing their hearing), and most adult candidates for a cochlear implant fall into this category.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults typically perceive more of a mechanical sound after implantation; the sound typically becomes more natural after four to eight weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults benefit from bilateral implants, which improve speech perception and allow patients to hear better in conditions with background noise (such as restaurants), to localize sound, and to hear sound coming from either side without having to turn one's head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. A randomized trial including 38 patients found that, compared with unilateral implants, patients who received bilateral implants performed better when noise came from different directions and were better able to localize sound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-amplification-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2707146\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in providing hearing amplification is to determine whether a patient will benefit from a hearing aid.
