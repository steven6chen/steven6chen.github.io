The prevalence of the Adie's pupil is about two cases per 1000 population. Although patients of all ages are affected, the mean age is 32 years, and there is a female predominance (2.6:1) for the idiopathic variety (Adie's tonic pupil).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tonic pupil is the result of damage to the parasympathetic ciliary ganglion. The parasympathetic innervation to the iris and ciliary body travels with the third cranial nerve and synapses in the ciliary ganglion. After damage to the ciliary ganglion, reinnervation and up-regulation of the post-synaptic receptors occurs, a process known as denervation supersensitivity. The number of axons destined for the ciliary body, however, is about 30 times the number that supply the pupil. After denervation occurs, the reinnervation may be aberrant, and fibers formerly destined for the ciliary body now travel to the pupil (aberrant regeneration).</p><p>Activation of the near response in this situation produces a better near reaction than light reaction (light-near dissociation of the pupils), and the reaction is tonic.</p><p>Most cases of the tonic pupil are idiopathic and referred to as the Adie's tonic pupil. However, the tonic pupil can be caused by local disorders within the orbit affecting the ciliary ganglion including tumor, inflammation, trauma, surgery, or infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53885 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonic-pupil/abstract/6-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-45</a>]. Systemic autonomic neuropathies can also affect the ciliary ganglion and produce the tonic pupil. As an example, the Ross syndrome is a dysautonomia characterized by a triad of tonic pupil, hyporeflexia, and segmental anhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonic-pupil/abstract/16,38,43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38,43,45</a>].</p><p>The infectious and inflammatory causes of the tonic pupil are further expanded in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60816 \">table 2</a>) as are the autonomic or peripheral neuropathic etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67360 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of the Adie's tonic pupil are as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77357 \">table 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor or absent pupillary light reaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmental palsy of the sphincter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tonic pupillary near response with light-near dissociation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinergic supersensitivity of the denervated muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accommodation paresis (that tends to recover)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induced astigmatism at near and tonicity of accommodation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasional &quot;ciliary cramp&quot; (accommodative spasm) with near work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasional regional corneal anesthesia (trigeminal fibers in ciliary ganglion damaged)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main clinical question in the patient with anisocoria is deciding whether the larger pupil or the smaller pupil is the problem. The key differentiating signs are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pupillary reaction to light</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pupillary near response</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of anisocoria in the light and in the dark</p><p/><p>Review of old photographs is useful for defining the duration of an anisocoria. Patients referred for pupil abnormalities should be told to bring as many old photographs of themselves as possible to the appointment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with anisocoria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A pupil that reacts poorly to light is obviously the pathologic one, if one pupil is poorly reactive and the other pupil is normally reactive. In these circumstances, the anisocoria is generally less in the dark and more in the light (poor constriction of affected pupil). Patients with an impaired light reaction should be tested for a pupillary near response. A normal near response in the setting of an impaired or absent light response is termed light-near dissociation. This finding can be unilateral or bilateral. Bilateral light-near dissociation of the pupils is demonstrated, if the light reaction is poor and the near reaction is intact in both eyes. The table lists the causes of light-near dissociation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60550\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60550 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>The tonic pupil is distinguished from other causes of light-near dissociation by the tonicity of the near reaction. The tonic reaction is the result of iris sphincter supersensitivity to acetylcholine. The pupil is often irregular. When stimulated, the pupil response is strong and tonic, and relaxation is slow and sustained.</p><p>Initially, there may be an isolated internal ophthalmoplegia, and in the acute stage there may be no reaction to light or near at all. This presentation may mimic pharmacologic dilation of the pupil. In this setting, the diagnosis of a tonic pupil can usually be made by observation, as the light-near dissociation and denervation supersensitivity develop over time. Some segments of the pupil may react normally (vermiform movements), while other segments may not react to light well or at all (sector paresis).</p><p>Although the tonic pupil is usually larger than the uninvolved fellow eye, over time the pupil tends to become smaller (the &quot;little old Adie's&quot; pupil). About 20 percent of Adie's pupils are bilateral with a 4 percent incidence of bilateral involvement per year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73497 \">picture 1</a>). The key finding in the miotic long-standing Adie's pupil will be the poor light reaction and the tonic near response. Patients may have decreased deep tendon reflexes in the complete Holmes-Adie syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57952 \">table 6</a>), but most patients are otherwise asymptomatic.</p><p>No further pharmacologic testing is typically necessary if the characteristic features of the tonic pupil are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78432\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78432 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77357 \">table 4</a>). Otherwise, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> (one-eighth percent to one-tenth percent) may be useful to demonstrate the cholinergic supersensitivity in the tonic pupil. After the administration of the dilute pilocarpine, a more miotic response will be seen compared with the fellow eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78432\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78432 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Unfortunately, cholinergic supersensitivity is not uniformly present in tonic pupils (about 80 percent) and is not specific for postganglionic parasympathetic denervation. Both eyes should be tested, as some patients may respond to low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a>, especially patients who have light colored irises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonic-pupil/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Supersensitivity has also been reported after preganglionic lesions of the third nerve. In addition, as stated previously, an acute Adie's tonic pupil may not have had time to develop postganglionic supersensitivity, and absent supersensitivity does not exclude the diagnosis in this setting. Because this presentation may mimic pharmacologic dilation, the patient should be followed over time to allow the additional typical findings of tonic pupil to develop.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a defined etiology (eg, local orbital or known systemic autonomic neuropathy) for the tonic pupil do not generally require additional evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53885 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60816 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67360 \">table 3</a>). Likewise, no additional testing is necessary if the clinical or pharmacologic diagnosis of the typical Adie's tonic pupil is made.</p><p>Symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal, cardiac, or segmental hypohidrosis and areflexia should prompt evaluation for systemic dysautonomia (eg, Ross syndrome) in patients with tonic pupils. Patients with unexplained bilateral tonic pupils should probably have serologic testing for syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonic-pupil/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.) In one series of 60 patients with tonic pupils, 5 of 29 had positive serologic tests for syphilis and in addition had bilateral tonic pupils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonic-pupil/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>While syphilis may infrequently produce the tonic pupil, late syphilis is associated with the Argyll Robertson pupil. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurosyphilis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurosyphilis&quot;</a>.) In addition to light-near dissociation, the Argyll Robertson pupil is typically miotic and irregular. However, Argyll Robertson pupils are not tonic. They constrict quickly to near and redilate quickly when removed from the near stimulus.</p><p>Although classically described with neurosyphilis, other entities may produce pupillary light-near dissociation. These etiologies include diabetes, chronic alcoholism, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, peripheral nerve disease, (eg, Charcot-Marie-Tooth), rare midbrain tumors, herpes zoster, neurosarcoidosis, and lymphocytic meningoradiculitis.</p><p>Patients with light-near dissociation of the pupils in the setting of a third nerve palsy including aberrant regeneration of the third nerve or other dorsal midbrain signs should undergo neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging of the brainstem with contrast. Patients with systemic autonomic neuropathies (eg, Ross syndrome) should undergo appropriate general neurologic and other testing as indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with a tonic pupil do not require any treatment. Patients with an underlying systemic cause for their tonic pupils should have treatment directed at their other autonomic neuropathies.</p><p>Although patients with Adie's syndrome may complain of difficulty reading due to accommodative paresis, this usually improves spontaneously. Unequal power bifocal reading aids or a unilateral frosted bifocal segment may be necessary for patients with permanent accommodative paresis. Topical low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> may help with symptomatic patients but can precipitate ciliary spasm, induced myopia, cause brow ache, or worsen the appearance of the anisocoria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonic-pupil/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Adie's tonic pupil is benign, and most patients only require reassurance once the diagnosis is confirmed. Angle-closure glaucoma has been rarely reported secondary to the tonic pupil, once in association with plateau iris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonic-pupil/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The accommodative paresis tends to resolve spontaneously over several months. The pupil light reaction usually does not recover and may even become weaker over time with an increasing light-near dissociation. In some patients the pupil becomes smaller with time (&quot;little old Adie's&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tonic pupil results from parasympathetic denervation at the level of the ciliary ganglion and postganglionic nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tonic pupil constricts poorly or not at all to light but reacts better to accommodation (near response), such that the initially larger tonic pupil becomes smaller than its normal fellow and remains tonically constricted, redilating very slowly when exposed to dark.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of the tonic pupil are idiopathic and referred to as the Adie's tonic pupil (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above).
