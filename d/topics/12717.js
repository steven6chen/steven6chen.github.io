VAA and VAPA are relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The splenic artery (VAA) and hepatic artery (VAPA) are most commonly involved. VAA and VAPA can be life-threatening conditions with high incidences of rupture and hemorrhage. The clinical features of symptomatic disease differ for each anatomic location; however, clinical symptoms and signs are nevertheless nonspecific. VAA and VAPA are often not suspected initially in patients presenting with abdominal complaints, due to their rarity, which can lead to a delay in diagnosis. Consequently, these often present with life-threatening hemorrhage due to a high incidence of rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Thus, the general approach to <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span> is early elective intervention rather than watchful waiting, to minimize the risk of rupture. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms will be reviewed here. The surgical and endovascular management of VAAs and VAPAs are discussed separately.

Aneurysms of the renal artery are usually regarded separately.</p><p>True VAA involves all layers of the wall, each of which is thinned but intact. False aneurysms, visceral artery pseudoaneurysm (VAPAs), result from a tear in the vessel wall due to trauma with subsequent periarterial hematoma formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As with any blood vessel, a given artery is defined as aneurysmal if there is a focal dilation of the artery that has a diameter more than 1.5 times the normal diameter of the artery. As an example, the most common true VAA, splenic artery aneurysm, is usually noted when the diameter of the artery is around 1 cm. <span class=\"nowrap\">VAAs/VAPAs</span> are often not clinically detected until their diameters are well beyond the diameter that is considered aneurysmal. </p><p>Average normal diameters of the various visceral vessels are as follows (&plusmn;standard deviation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac trunk: 0.79&plusmn;0.06 cm </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common hepatic artery: 0.50&plusmn;0.04 cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper hepatic artery: 0.45&plusmn;0.03 cm </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic artery: 0.46&plusmn;0.03 cm </p><p/><p>The splenic artery (VAA) and hepatic artery (VAPA) are most commonly involved.

The diagnosis is increasingly more frequent due to the detection of incidental disease using advanced imaging modalities often performed to evaluate unrelated complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, instrumentation used to diagnose and treat trauma and other conditions (eg, biliary disease) has increased the incidence of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Hepatic artery aneurysm is more common in men (male: female = 2:1). Most hepatic artery aneurysms are extrahepatic (80 percent) with 60 percent of these located in the common hepatic artery, 30 percent located in the right hepatic artery, and 5 percent located in the left hepatic artery. </p><p>It is not unusual for patients with hepatic aneurysms to present with multiple aneurysms involving the visceral (31 percent) and nonvisceral circulation (42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Posttraumatic false aneurysms are most often the result of penetrating and crush injuries or wounds, surgical procedures, liver transplantation, or occurring after percutaneous needle biopsy of the liver (transhepatic cholangiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Most hepatic artery aneurysms are incidentally identified on routine imaging to investigate unrelated symptoms and pathology. This is in contrast to the era prior to widespread abdominal imaging, in which most hepatic artery aneurysms presented with rupture or were discovered during autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Symptomatic hepatic artery aneurysm presents with nausea and right upper quadrant or midepigastric pain radiating to the back. In many instances, hepatic artery aneurysm becomes clinically apparent when there is erosion into the biliary tree <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> portal vein with the subsequent development of portal hypertension, or rupture in the retroperitoneal space <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peritoneal cavity. Hemobilia, which is suggested by Quincke&rsquo;s classic triad (jaundice, biliary colic, and gastrointestinal bleeding) occurs in one-third of patients with hepatic artery aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Rarely, large hepatic artery aneurysms may present as a pulsatile right upper quadrant mass. Less than 10 percent of hepatic artery aneurysms present as infected (mycotic) aneurysms, which was the dominant clinical presentation before the antibiotic era.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307281089\"><span class=\"h3\">Splenic artery aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenic artery aneurysms are the third most common true aneurysm occurring in the abdomen after aortic and iliac artery aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Splenic artery aneurysms are associated with intraabdominal aneurysms involving other visceral arteries (3 percent) and renal arteries (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. One-third of patients have multiple aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Splenic artery aneurysms are usually solitary, saccular in shape, and frequently localized to the distal third of the artery, the bifurcation region, and the splenic hilum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. False aneurysms of the splenic artery are uncommon but can occur, particularly in association with pancreatitis, but also as a result of instrumentation. </p><p>True splenic artery aneurysms are commonly associated with conditions of increased flow, such as pregnancy (particularly multiparity), arterial venous fistulas and malformations, and portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/1,12,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,25,26</a>]. Increased blood flow through the splenic artery has been suggested to lead to irreversible damage of the tunica media predisposing to aneurysm formation; muscle atrophy and calcification are secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In pregnancy, hormonal changes combined with portal congestion are thought to degrade the structural integrity of the artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/12,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27</a>]. The prevalence of splenic artery aneurysm in females of childbearing age is less than 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. By contrast, the prevalence of splenic artery aneurysm in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension is 7 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Eight to 13 percent of patients awaiting and following liver transplant develop splenic artery aneurysm because of the large portosystemic shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/12,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28,29</a>]. Splenic artery aneurysm rupture after liver transplantation is not uncommon.</p><p>Patients with symptomatic splenic artery aneurysm present with nausea and vague abdominal discomfort in the midepigastric or left upper quadrant. This may be associated with left shoulder discomfort associated with irritation of the diaphragm. Nearly half of patients with splenic artery aneurysm have moderate splenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a large series, rupture was the presenting symptom for splenic artery aneurysm in approximately 5 percent of patients, with a mean diameter of 3.5 cm (3.2 cm for males, 2.3 cm for females) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The mean diameter of the nonruptured splenic artery aneurysms was 2.2 cm. </p><p>The classic presentation of ruptured splenic artery aneurysm is the &quot;double rupture phenomenon.&quot; Initial rupture of splenic artery aneurysm is associated with severe abdominal pain and initial hemodynamic instability, which is compensated for and followed by a period of relative normalization. This latent period is due to containment rupture within the lesser sac and tamponade of the splenic artery aneurysm. If untreated, the lesser sac can give way leading to free rupture into the peritoneal cavity with recurrent hemodynamic instability. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307281141\"><span class=\"h3\">Celiac artery aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aneurysms of the celiac trunk are one of the rarest types (4 percent) of visceral artery aneurysm, with an incidence of 0.01 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/7,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20,21</a>]. </p><p>The etiology of celiac artery aneurysms is usually atherosclerosis or medial degeneration, with infectious causes (eg, treponema pallidum causing syphilis), which were common in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, now very rare. The average age of newly diagnosed patients is 55 years and women now comprise almost half of all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. True arterial aneurysms can occur distal to sites of chronic vascular compression due to poststenotic dilatation, and have been reported for compression of the celiac artery by the median ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-artery-compression-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Celiac artery compression syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most celiac artery aneurysms are asymptomatic, with approximately 85 percent discovered incidentally on imaging, while only 7 percent are discovered by autopsy. Of note, association with other aneurysms, such as aortic, renal, popliteal, and femoral, is common, occurring in two-thirds of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Symptoms, such as midepigastric and back pain, can mimic pancreatitis due to the location of the arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307281161\"><span class=\"h3\">Superior mesenteric artery aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superior mesenteric artery aneurysms are also rare. Atherosclerosis is the main cause of superior mesenteric artery aneurysms. In the past, 60 percent were infected (mycotic) due to septic emboli (eg, endocarditis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/7,15,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15,20,21</a>]. Other etiological factors include polyarteritis nodosa, Behcet syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic connective tissue disorders, vasculitis, trauma, cystic medial necrosis, neurofibromatosis, and history of intravenous drug abuse. </p><p>Symptoms related to superior mesenteric artery aneurysms are generally nonspecific, but if the aneurysm is large enough, can rarely present as a palpable mass. Superior mesenteric artery aneurysms most commonly involve the proximal 5 cm of the superior mesenteric artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Extension of aneurysm-related thrombus or dissection that affects the collateral circulation of the celiac and inferior mesenteric arteries may result in ischemic symptoms, leading to pain after meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/9,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,34</a>].

For patients who complain of abdominal pain, correlation of the location of the pain and location of the aneurysm is necessary, and other likely causes for the pain should be excluded before concluding that the symptoms are due to an incidentally identified aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H231181678\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Plain abdominal films may raise suspicion of the presence of VAA, particularly when there is visible calcification in the wall of the aneurysm sac. Calcification, which is often viewed as evidence of chronicity and stability, was reported in one study to occur in 90 percent of the ruptured aneurysms, and thus, its prognostic value is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Upper gastrointestinal tract contrast imaging may detect the existence of a filling defect in the stomach or duodenum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Ultrasonography and cross-sectional abdominal vascular imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance) provide an accurate diagnosis of VAA. Duplex ultrasound is an important and helpful diagnostic tool, particularly for demonstrating intrahepatic lesions. Ultrasound can measure blood flow inside the aneurysm sac and portal venous waveforms will be arterialized if a fistula is present. Ultrasound is also the preferred initial imaging modality for identifying VAA in pregnant women because it is noninvasive and has no adverse fetal effects. The main disadvantage of ultrasound is that it is technician dependent and obesity and overlying bowel gas reduce its sensitivity, especially for smaller lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging is avoided in the first trimester.

The general approach to VAA and VAPA is early elective treatment when recognized, rather than watchful waiting, to minimize the risk of rupture. Rupture is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality ranging from 10 to 25 percent for splenic artery aneurysm, and considerably higher for other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Medical optimization may not be feasible for patients who present acutely with bleeding or rupture. Although VAA and VAPA in poor risk surgical candidates might previously have been observed with serial imaging studies, many can be approached percutaneously, provided the lesion is anatomically suitable for endovascular techniques.

True visceral artery aneurysms involve all layers of the wall, each of which is thinned but intact. Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs) result from a tear in the vessel wall due to trauma (iatrogenic, blunt or penetrating injury) with subsequent periarterial hematoma formation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The splenic artery (VAA) and hepatic artery (VAPA) are most commonly involved. Less commonly involved are the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and gastric, intestinal, pancreatic, gastroduodenal, pancreaticoduodenal, and inferior mesenteric artery aneurysms are much less frequently reported.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visceral artery aneurysms are usually asymptomatic and identified as incidental, unexpected findings on imaging of the abdomen, particularly on computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen or CT angiography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of VAA is poorly characterized, as VAAs may be associated with a variety of conditions, including atherosclerosis, medial degeneration, and conditions of increased flow (eg, pregnancy, portal hypertension, liver transplantation) The natural history for VAA located in different anatomic locations is not uniform and also not well defined. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of symptomatic VAAs differs for each anatomic location; however, clinical symptoms and signs are nonspecific and VAA and VAPA are often not suspected initially in patients presenting with abdominal complaints, due to their rarity, which can lead to a delay in diagnosis. For patients in whom the diagnosis is suspected (eg, pregnant women with sudden left upper quadrant pain), imaging demonstrating the aneurysm is required to confirm the diagnosis. For patients presenting with rupture, the diagnosis may necessarily be made in the operating room. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general approach to <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span> is early elective intervention, rather than watchful waiting, to minimize the risk of rupture.
