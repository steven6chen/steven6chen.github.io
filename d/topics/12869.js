For the reasons described below, late debridement is preferred, if possible, at least three to four weeks following the onset of acute pancreatitis. Delayed debridement allows clinical stabilization of the patient, resolution of early organ failure, and a decrease in the intense inflammatory reaction in the retroperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The initial management of acute pancreatitis is discussed elsewhere.

The underlying mechanism for this phase of disease is believed to be the host's inflammatory and cytokine response, resulting in organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During the first few days of critical illness, early death from irreversible organ failure accounts for up to 60 percent of mortality in patients with severe acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This early organ failure, which is predominately renal and pulmonary, can be treated by aggressive volume resuscitation, enteral feeding, and support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-pancreatitis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infrequently, exploratory laparotomy is considered to confirm the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis and to exclude other potentially treatable causes of recalcitrant multiorgan system failure such as infarcted bowel, gangrenous gallbladder, or perforated viscus. In patients who survive this early inflammatory storm, increased morbidity and mortality rates are due to persistent organ failure, pancreatic necrosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If treatable causes of organ failure are not identified and the etiology is confirmed to be severe acute pancreatitis with necrosis, early pancreatic debridement is rarely helpful. Early debridement is often complicated by intra-abdominal hypervascularity, altered anatomic relationships, and an inability to discriminate dead from surrounding live tissue, making debridement imprecise, bloody, and ineffective. When infected necrosis necessitates early debridement, the debridement often is associated with incomplete removal of necrotic tissue and a high rate of injury to normal surrounding tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/19,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,23</a>]. These patients have a higher morbidity and mortality rate and frequently require multiple surgical procedures for persistent pancreatic necrosis or repair of iatrogenic damage to the surrounding organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late phase</strong> &ndash; The optimal time for surgical debridement is approximately four weeks after the onset of pancreatitis, when vascular inflammation has decreased, organization of the process has occurred, and delineation of live from dead tissue is complete. At this point, the retroperitoneal inflammatory response decreases and the necrotic areas are demarcated from the surrounding viable tissue, which usually permits definitive operative debridement. The organized, demarcated collection is termed walled-off pancreatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

The use of CT-directed fine-needle aspiration confirms the diagnosis of infected pancreatic necrosis and supports the decision for surgical debridement.

Mobilization of the colon (eg, splenic flexure mobilization) is <strong>not</strong> advised in this setting, as the risk of colonic devascularization is high. Occasionally, the necrotic process involves the mesocolon to such an extent that adequate debridement skeletonizes the colonic blood supply, leaving the colon vulnerable to ischemic injury. In this situation, partial colectomy with end ileostomy and Hartmann's procedure is the safest and most expedient way to remove jeopardized colon, divert the fecal stream, and ensure prompt recovery and the ability to establish early enteral feeding. Patients potentially at risk for this outcome should be informed of this possibility preoperatively and be visited by an enterostomal therapist for marking.

It is best defined by cross sectional imaging (contrast-enhanced CT). Walled-off pancreatic necrosis is well suited to minimally invasive debridement techniques, including endoscopic transgastric drainage, external percutaneous drainage with irrigation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66786\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66786 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68937\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68937 \">image 7</a>), and laparoscopic video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement. In the 2014 updated Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis, walled-off pancreatic necrosis is one of several recognized local complications (others include acute peripancreatic fluid collection, acute necrotic collection, pancreatic pseudocyst, gastric outlet obstruction, splenic or portal vein thrombosis, and colonic necrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

In suitable candidates, percutaneous drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endoscopic <span class=\"nowrap\">drainage/debridement</span> provide minimally invasive alternatives to open surgery that could be equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PANTER study (PAncreatitis, Necrosectomy versus sTEp up appRoach), a randomized trial of percutaneous catheter drainage in 88 patients, found that 35 percent of patients were treated successfully with percutaneous catheter drainage alone, while the remainder required percutaneous drainage followed by video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Compared with open pancreatic debridement, preoperative drainage followed by VARD significantly decreased the rate of new-onset multiple organ failure (12 versus 40 percent), incisional hernias (7 versus 24 percent), and new-onset diabetes (16 versus 38 percent) but did not significantly affect mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another multicenter Dutch trial compared endoscopic catheter drainage followed by endoscopic necrosectomy (if necessary) with percutaneous catheter drainage followed by VARD (if necessary) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Ninety-eight patients with infected pancreatic necrosis were randomly assigned after four weeks since the onset of symptoms to ensure that they had at least partial encapsulation of the necrotic collection. Forty-three and 51 percent of patients in the endoscopic and VARD groups, respectively, only required catheter drainage. Compared with surgery, endoscopic treatment resulted in similar mortality plus major morbidity rate at six months (43 versus 45 percent) but lower incidence of cardiovascular organ failure (6 versus 19 percent), fewer pancreatic fistulas (5 versus 32 percent), and a shorter hospital stay (by 16 days). Approximately one-third of patients treated endoscopically required additional percutaneous catheter drainage or VARD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263650\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous CT-guided catheter drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporary percutaneous drainage can be used to decompress retroperitoneal fluid collections and allow stabilization of patients with sepsis prior to formal operative debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Computed tomography (CT) guidance is used to establish percutaneous access into pancreatic fluid collections using the most direct transperitoneal route available, thereby avoiding intervening bowel and solid organs. The number and size of catheters placed is dictated by the size and location of the space containing the necrosis, the viscosity of the fluid aspirated, and the amount of particulate debris. The procedure is performed with local anesthesia.</p><p>After placement, the catheters undergo vigorous manual irrigation with isotonic saline every several days, combined with contrast CT scans to follow the removal of necrotic debris, assess changes in the cavity dimension, and ensure catheter lumen patency. Over time, small-diameter drains are upsized to larger-bore catheters (24 to 28 French) for removal of necrotic debris. CT-guided catheter drainage requires a dedicated interventional radiologist who will perform sequential interventions as necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/37,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,48,49</a>]. A drawback to this approach is that all mechanical debridement and tissue evacuation must be performed through limited-diameter catheters, which require frequent replacement and meticulous maintenance. </p><p>Although percutaneous catheter drainage was used as a bridging technique for patients who are too unstable to undergo surgical debridement, approximately one-third to one-half of patients can be managed with percutaneous drainage alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. </p><p>One disadvantage to the percutaneous route is the risk of persistent pancreatico-cutaneous fistula. Features that predispose to pancreatico-cutaneous fistulas include communication between the pancreatic collection and the pancreatic duct or complete obstruction of the duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. If necessary, percutaneous drainage appears more likely to be successful in patients with normal pancreatic ducts <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with ductal strictures but without communication between the pancreatic duct and the pancreatic collection.

Under conscious sedation or anesthesia, a puncture site is identified by locating a bulge into the gastrointestinal lumen (representing the fluid collection) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with endoscopic ultrasound. The fluid collection is then entered, a sample of fluid is aspirated for gram stain and culture, and a cystenterostomy is created using wire-guided balloon dilators. Once the cystenterostomy is established, direct endoscopic debridement can be carried out using a combination of irrigation, snares, baskets, and stone retrieval balloons. Following mechanical debridement, stents are placed into the cavity. In addition, a nasocystic tube may be placed for postoperative lavage. </p><p>In the past, double pigtail plastic catheters were standard for endoscopic drainage procedures. Many centers have replaced pigtail catheters with lumen-apposing metal stents that have wider diameters to facilitate drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The materials and techniques, however, are constantly evolving and have not been standardized.</p><p>Serial abdominal CT scans are performed every one to two weeks after the intervention to follow the resolution of necrosis.

If percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided fine-needle aspiration has been performed, the antibiotic choices should reflect the culture and sensitivity results. The most common organisms causing infection in necrotizing pancreatitis include <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, and <em>Enterococcus</em>, and the initial recommended antibiotic coverage is with a carbapenem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/4,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,55</a>].

Open debridement remains the gold standard and is usually performed with external drainage. Some surgeons prefer internal drainage with a cystgastrostomy. Laparoscopic surgery can be considered in selected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20486554\"><span class=\"h2\">Open debridement with external drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open debridement under general anesthesia with closure over drains is the gold standard for pancreatic debridement. In an observational series of 102 patients, this approach resulted in operative morbidity in 72 percent and mortality in 4 percent; the mean hospital length of stay was 26 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These results are consistent with those reported from other large surgical series utilizing this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/9,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,56</a>]. </p><p>The following steps are performed with open debridement with external drainage:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incision</strong> &ndash; The abdomen is opened through either an upper midline or bilateral subcostal incision. If a colostomy is anticipated, the site should be marked preoperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Entry into the retroperitoneum</strong> &ndash; The retroperitoneum is entered through the lesser sac by mobilizing the omentum off the transverse colon. Alternatively, entrance to the lesser sac can be accomplished through an avascular plane in the transverse mesocolon to the right or left of the middle colic vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Utilizing preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging as a guide, specific areas of pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis and associated fluid collections are identified. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Debridement </strong>&ndash; Once the main site of necrosis is entered, fluid is evacuated and debridement is begun by pulling the loosely organized debris away from the firm, inflamed, viable tissue using blunt dissection, finger pinching, ring forceps, and infrequent sharp dissection. Necrotic debris should be cultured for fungus as well as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Viable tissue should be preserved and can be identified by its firm, indurated appearance and consistency, as well as bleeding with manipulation. Major vascular structures are characteristically well preserved, allowing careful skeletonization during the debridement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once the main cavity is debrided, any extension of the process is identified by gentle digital palpation from within the main cavity, exploring communicating spaces and extensions of the necrosis throughout the retroperitoneum. Debridement often extends into the fat of the mesocolon or small bowel mesentery. In both of these sites, meticulous care should be taken to avoid vascular injury, particularly to the colic, superior, or inferior mesenteric vessels. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cholecystectomy</strong> &ndash; For patients with biliary pancreatitis, a cholecystectomy should be performed if technically possible, dissecting the gallbladder retrograde from the fundus to the infundibulum. The need for an intraoperative cholangiogram will depend upon whether endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed prior to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Feeding tube </strong>&ndash; Enteral access should be established through a gastrojejunal feeding tube (18- or 22-French T-tube or a low-profile feeding tube) placed via a Stamm-type gastrostomy, directing the distal jejunal feeding port past the pylorus and ligament of Treitz into the first portion of the jejunum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76417 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drain placement </strong>&ndash; Two to four large (19-French) closed suction drains are placed at the time of operation, with the number and positioning dictated by the extent of debridement and concern for the development of a postoperative pancreatic fistula. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290573\"><span class=\"h2\">Open debridement with internal drainage and cystgastrostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open debridement with internal drainage is favored by some surgeons, when feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This procedure is only appropriate for patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis. The surgery is performed via a midline incision into the peritoneal cavity. (See <a href=\"#H265589\" class=\"local\">'Walled-off pancreatic necrosis'</a> above.)</p><p>A longitudinal gastrotomy is made along the greater curvature, and the posterior gastric wall is exposed. A needle is used to identify the walled-off pancreatic collection posterior to the stomach. The cavity is then opened with cautery, and an endovascular stapling device is used to create a generous (8-cm) cystgastrostomy. Debridement is then performed. A nasogastric tube is placed in the cavity. A gastrostomy drainage tube (Foley catheter) is placed, and the gastrotomy is closed. The nasogastric tube is then flushed with isotonic saline every four hours for two to three days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1552920\"><span class=\"h2\">Open packing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open packing with planned reoperation every 48 to 72 hours until the necrosis is adequately removed is only appropriate when early surgical intervention is required or when the necrosis is too poorly demarcated to permit complete debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1549588\" class=\"local\">'Timing of debridement'</a> above). The open packing method is effective in controlling intra-abdominal sepsis but mandates multiple laparotomies, which increases overall mortality, the length of hospital stay, and the incidence of postoperative enterocutaneous fistulas and incisional hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Because of these concerns, open packing should be utilized sparingly and is primarily indicated for patients with large collections extending across the retroperitoneum and into the retrocolic spaces or when bleeding is difficult to control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>A nonadherent gauze should be placed over the exposed stomach and colon to prevent inadvertent debridement of the intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Packing is kept moist. Drains are placed at the time of final laparotomy and secondary closure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H885824\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two laparoscopic approaches for pancreatic debridement: video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement and transperitoneal debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/28,30,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,59</a>]. Both techniques utilize laparoscopes, video cameras, and similar instrumentation, but significant differences between the two techniques exist. Most published experience is with video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1171691\"><span class=\"h3\">Video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement approach requires preoperative percutaneous access to the retroperitoneal space, which is established via interventional radiology. Before surgery, a 12- to 14-French catheter is placed into the dominant fluid collection through a direct access site in the left upper quadrant or flank under radiologic guidance. This catheter provides an anatomic access route, which guides the subsequent operation. </p><p>The surgery is performed through an incision made directly over the drain site, which is extended directly down into the necrotic cavity. Long grasping forceps are used for debridement under direct vision. When the debridement extends into the retroperitoneum, a videoscope is inserted through the incision to allow visualization and deep mechanical debridement through the scope. Two large-bore single-lumen drains are then placed in the retroperitoneum under direct vision using the videoscope. </p><p>Continuous retroperitoneal lavage with isotonic saline or dialysis fluid is continued postoperatively at a rate of 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> and patients are followed for clinical progression, declining serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and improvement of necrosis on contrast-enhanced CT scans. Repeated debridements are done every 7 to 10 days until the necrosis cavity is seen to be clear of debris and lined by healthy granulation tissue. At this point, irrigation is stopped and external drainage is continued until the output stops and the drains can be removed. </p><p>The advantage of video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement is minimizing the risk of peritoneal contamination. The main drawback of this approach is the limited access and visualization, which limits the amount of debris that can be retrieved and leads to multiple interventions. In addition, limited visualization precludes simultaneous cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography, or feeding jejunostomy placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A meta-analysis of video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement reported a 64 percent success rate, 47 percent morbidity, and 14 percent mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H885831\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopically assisted transperitoneal debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laparoscopic transperitoneal approach to pancreatic debridement uses conventional laparoscopic intraperitoneal access followed by transmesocolic debridement, utilizing one port for the video camera and two additional working ports. </p><p>The main drawback of this approach is the potential for peritoneal contamination. In addition, reintervention is usually not possible because of scar tissue. For these reasons, laparoscopic transperitoneal debridement is most appropriate as a single-stage procedure for patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/28,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20486603\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early postoperative management after pancreatic debridement focuses on volume replacement, blood glucose control, maintenance of normothermia, and adequate pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Patients require large volumes of fluid to maintain tissue perfusion and renal function, since they have massive third-space losses. Most patients remain intubated upon leaving the operating room because of the anticipated large fluid shifts over the initial 24 to 36 hours. In the absence of preoperative pulmonary failure, most should be candidates for early ventilator weaning protocols.

Complications after pancreatic debridement include intra-abdominal fluid collections, bleeding, pancreatic fistulas, incisional hernias, and pancreatic insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20486619\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-abdominal fluid collections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common postoperative complication requiring intervention after debridement is a residual fluid collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These collections are frequently infected and can result from a pancreatic leak inadequately controlled by the drains placed at surgery or from a hollow viscus injury. Intra-abdominal fluid collections can be identified on computed tomography (CT) scan and are managed with percutaneous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/1,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7</a>].

Bleeding can occur early or late in the postoperative period and can lead to hemodynamic instability.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early postoperative bleeding is usually due to laceration or avulsion of peripancreatic arteries or veins. This complication appears to be more common after minimally invasive debridement, presumably due to the limited field of vision and lack of tactile feedback during necrotic tissue removal. Prompt reoperation and control of bleeding is indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late postoperative bleeding is usually caused by rupture of a retroperitoneal pseudoaneurysm, either into the free peritoneal cavity or out of operatively placed drains. Patients who earlier appeared well and have the abrupt onset of tachycardia, hypotension, mental status change, and increased bloody output from their surgically placed drains should be considered to have a visceral pseudoaneurysm until proven otherwise. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The choice of therapy depends upon whether or not the patient is hemodynamically stable. In unstable patients, emergency reoperation is indicated. In patients in whom volume resuscitation leads to a period of cardiovascular stability, visceral angiography with transcatheter embolization is an option. Once control of bleeding is obtained through direct operative ligation, transcatheter embolization, or stent placement, a careful assessment of the retroperitoneum is essential. The retroperitoneum should be evaluated for possible causes of pseudoaneurysm formation, such as sepsis from an infected fluid collection or an uncontrolled pancreatic fistula, or a mechanical process, such as erosion of drains into an artery. Common areas for pseudoaneurysm formation in the setting of pancreatic necrosis are the splenic artery, gastroduodenal artery, pancreaticoduodenal arcade, and dorsal pancreatic artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79244\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79244 \">image 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53264\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53264 \">image 9</a>).

When pancreatic fistulas are identified at a drain site, maintaining adequate external drainage is essential. Our practice is to place additional securing sutures on the fistula drain using a local anesthetic at the bedside to prevent inadvertent dislodgement. </p><p>Pancreatic fistulas may be characterized by their anatomic relationship to the pancreatic duct as either a side or end fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with side pancreatic fistulas retain the possibility of fistula closure, either spontaneously or with the help of a decompressive endoscopically placed pancreatic duct stent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an end fistula usually have a disconnected pancreatic segment.

The goal of pancreatic debridement is to excise all dead and devitalized pancreatic and peripancreatic tissue while preserving viable functioning pancreas, controlling resultant pancreatic fistulas, and limiting extraneous organ damage. For patients with biliary pancreatitis, cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography is an important secondary objective of the surgery because this will prevent recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"#H20486505\" class=\"local\">'Indications for pancreatic debridement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal timing for pancreatic debridement is three to four weeks following the onset of acute pancreatitis. Delayed debridement allows clinical stabilization of the patient, resolution of early organ failure, and a decrease in the intense inflammatory reaction in the retroperitoneum.

Percutaneous catheter drainage is primarily a bridging technique for patients who are too unstable to undergo surgical debridement, although one-third of patients can be managed with percutaneous drainage alone. Endoscopic debridement is performed via a transgastric or transduodenal approach and is limited to patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis.

Patients with biliary pancreatitis should be informed that there is an increased risk of postoperative bile leak or biliary injury when a cholecystectomy is performed in the setting of retroperitoneal inflammation. If the CT scan shows involvement of the mesocolon, patients should be informed of the potential need for colon resection and a colostomy. (See <a href=\"#H1171338\" class=\"local\">'Surgeon's safety checklist for pancreatic debridement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open surgical debridement is the gold standard for management of pancreatic necrosis. Laparoscopic debridement is primarily limited to patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H1179953\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches to pancreatic debridement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reported mortality rate in patients undergoing debridement for pancreatic necrosis ranges from 4 to 25 percent. The mortality rate is related to the extent of necrosis, underlying organ failure, and infection of the necrotic tissue. Complications after pancreatic debridement include intra-abdominal fluid collections, bleeding, pancreatic fistulas, incisional hernias, and pancreatic insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H20486610\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-debridement/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Werner J, Feuerbach S, Uhl W, B&uuml;chler MW.
