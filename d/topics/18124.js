Increasing maternal age at conception has also contributed to the increased rate of triplet gestations. Triplet and higher-order births accounted for 103.6 per 100,000 births in the United States in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] but only 32.3 per 100,000 births in 1977 (before in vitro fertilization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rate of higher-order pregnancies has declined from its peak (193.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/100,000</span> in 1998) as a result of transfer of fewer embryos and an increase in fetal reduction procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy outcome after assisted reproductive technology&quot;, section on 'Proportion of singleton and multiple gestation'</a>.)</p><p>Higher-order multiple gestations are associated with significantly increased risks of maternal and neonatal morbidity compared with twin and singleton gestations, primarily because almost all triplets are born preterm and at an earlier mean gestational age (mean gestational age of delivery for triplets, twins, and singletons: 31.9, 35.3, and 38.7 weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

An ultrasound is performed in the first or early second trimester to ascertain if the triplet pregnancy is trichorionic, fully monochorionic, or has a monochorionic twin pair to help guide counseling and management. Surveillance of triplet pregnancies includes more frequent ultrasound examinations and frequent office visits (discussed below), particularly after 20 weeks of gestation, due to the increased risk of maternal morbidity and perinatal morbidity and mortality. In the second half of pregnancy, these pregnancies are at increased risk for preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and fetal growth discordance when compared with singletons. Delivery planning with an onsite level III neonatal intensive care unit should be considered for women with triplet pregnancies. However, many other issues are the same as in any pregnancy.

We use the following gestational weight gain targets, which reflect the higher end of Institute of Medicine (IOM) provisional gestational weight gain guidelines for twin pregnancies that go to term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body mass index (BMI) 18.5 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (normal weight): 25 kg (54 lbs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMI 25.0 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (overweight): 23 kg (50 lbs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMI &ge;30.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (obese): 19 kg (42 lbs)</p><p/><p>Some physicians believe that IOM weight gain targets are too high, particularly for obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For obese women with singleton gestations, gestational weight gain lower than that recommended by the IOM may be associated with better maternal and perinatal outcomes, and this may also be true for obese women with triplet gestations. No data are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weight gain and loss in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our recommendations for daily micronutrient supplementation are also based on existing data for twin pregnancies: calcium 2000 to 2500 mg, vitamin D 1000 international units, zinc 14 to 45 mg, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> 1 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Determination of amnionicity and chorionicity, which is ideally performed in the first trimester, is critical for risk assessment, counseling, and pregnancy management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues#H79772513\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;, section on 'Assessment of chorionicity'</a>.)</p><p>First-trimester ultrasound examination may detect abnormalities associated with adverse outcome. These include congenital anomalies, crown-rump length discordance (associated with aneuploidy, twin-twin transfusion syndrome [TTTS]), and enlarged nuchal translucency (associated with aneuploidy, congenital anomalies, TTTS).

We follow a protocol similar to that commonly used for managing monochorionic twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues#H139243013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;, section on 'Chorionicity-based follow-up'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin-twin transfusion syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;</a>). Starting at about 16 weeks, ultrasound examination is performed every two weeks to determine the maximum vertical amniotic fluid pocket for each sac and to visualize the bladder of each fetus. Fetal growth is assessed every two to four weeks. Oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios sequence suggests TTTS; nonvisualization of the bladder of the donor twin is a sign of more severe disease. In pregnancies with discordant amniotic fluid volume or fetal growth, we also perform umbilical artery Doppler assessment. Some centers routinely perform middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) Doppler to monitor for twin anemia polycythemia sequence in these pregnancies, but there is no proven benefit from such monitoring. We do not monitor MCA-PSV in this setting, in agreement with recommendations from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619736062\"><span class=\"h4\">Monoamniotic or diamniotic triplets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoamniotic placentation in any multiple gestation places the involved fetuses at high risk of cord entanglement and death from cord compression (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monoamniotic twin pregnancy (including conjoined twins)&quot;, section on 'Cord entanglement'</a>). They are also at risk of TTTS. Doppler velocimetry to detect altered flow has been proposed as suggestive of compression of cord vessels. High blood velocity in the umbilical vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], a notch in the umbilical artery waveform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], or persistent absent end diastolic flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] were reported as suggesting the fetoplacental circulation is compromised. However, given the poor specificity of these findings without associated adverse effects, the use of Doppler for routine monitoring of monoamniotic twins is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Instead, at about 26 weeks of gestation, the patient is admitted to the hospital for one hour of continuous fetal heart rate monitoring every eight hours.</p><p>Ultrasound monitoring for TTTS is the same as that described above for triamniotic dichorionic triplets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3887116257\"><span class=\"h4\">Triamniotic trichorionic triplets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triamniotic trichorionic placentation is associated with better perinatal outcomes than shared placentation; growth restriction is the major concern. Starting at 20 weeks, ultrasound examination is performed every three to four weeks to monitor fetal growth.

However, we see patients weekly beginning at 24 weeks of gestation to closely monitor for <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of preeclampsia and preterm labor.

If monitoring is indicated, the biophysical profile is our first-line testing strategy because it allows us to identify and access each fetus and avoid technical difficulties encountered with performing non-stress test in higher-order multiples, similar to what has been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>We implement fetal testing based on the type of chorionicity (discussed below). When results of fetal monitoring of a singleton preterm fetus are nonreassuring, the decision to intervene is determined by whether the fetus' risk from remaining in utero exceeds that from premature delivery. In multiple gestations, an ethical dilemma arises when one fetus is in jeopardy but the others are not. These decisions are complex, and should be made jointly with, at a minimum, the parents, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and a neonatologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3462127439\"><span class=\"h4\">Triamniotic dichorionic triplets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For triamniotic dichorionic triplets, we obtain a weekly biophysical profile score starting at 28 weeks because all of these pregnancies are at high risk for fetal complications.

Cervical length measurement is not a sensitive screening test for prediction of preterm birth in multiple gestations, and there is no strong evidence that any intervention (eg, progesterone supplementation, cerclage) is beneficial for preventing preterm birth in women with multiple gestation and short cervical length.

In the triplet gestations, most losses occurred prior to the ninth gestational week; loss of all three sacs occurred in 6 percent of triplet pregnancies. Triplet pregnancies that experienced spontaneous reduction delivered earlier than unreduced pregnancies with the same number of fetuses (eg, triplets-to-singletons delivered 10 days earlier than unreduced singletons, triplets-to-twins delivered four days earlier than unreduced twins).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3396530570\"><span class=\"h3\">Screening for neural tube defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum screening for neural tube defects with maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein has not been validated in triplets.

The Down syndrome risk of a 28-year old woman carrying a trizygotic triplet pregnancy is similar to that of a 35-year-old woman carrying a singleton pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In triplets, increased nuchal translucency (defined as greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age) has been validated as a screening test for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 but not for trisomy 13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this study, five of six aneuploid fetuses had increased nuchal translucency (three cases of trisomy 21, one of trisomy 18, and one of monosomy of chromosome X; a mosaic <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX</span> was missed).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1603221654\"><span class=\"h4\">Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is one option for prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidy. This technique is particularly useful for women with high age-related risk of fetal aneuploidy who are planning multifetal pregnancy reduction. Because karyotype results should be available prior to the reduction procedure, it would be possible to identify and selectively reduce an aneuploid fetus. However, CVS is more difficult in triplet than singleton gestations, and the patient must understand that it can be difficult to be certain that all three placentas have been sampled rather than one placenta being sampled twice and another missed altogether. The risk of a sampling error in triplets and higher order gestations was 1.2 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Although no study has specifically examined the outcomes of survivors of co-triplet demise, this risk likely depends on whether they shared or had separate placentas from the demised triplet. For example, monochorionic survivors of a co-twin fetal demise have higher rates of subsequent demise, preterm birth, and neurodevelopmental impairment than dichorionic survivors of a co-twin fetal demise.

For this reason, several authors have published growth tables specific for triplet pregnancies (medians, 10<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> percentiles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].

In the second half of pregnancy, these pregnancies are at increased risk for preterm delivery, preeclampsia, or fetal growth discordance when compared with singletons. Many other issues are the same as in any pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2013726565\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1812137191\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal mortality and morbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use the following gestational weight gain targets, which reflect the higher end of Institute of Medicine gestational weight gain guidelines for twins (see <a href=\"#H3126414299\" class=\"local\">'Weight gain and nutrition'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Body mass index (BMI) 18.5 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (normal weight): 25 kg (54 lbs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI 25.0 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (overweight): 23 kg (50 lbs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI &ge;30.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (obese): 19 kg (42 lbs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform an ultrasound in the first or early second trimester to ascertain if the triplet pregnancy is trichorionic, fully monochorionic, or has a monochorionic twin pair to help guide counseling and management. (See <a href=\"#H2586557571\" class=\"local\">'Timing and frequency of ultrasound examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical length measurement is not a sensitive screening test for prediction of preterm birth in multiple gestations, and there is no strong evidence that any intervention (eg, progesterone supplementation, cerclage) is beneficial for preventing preterm birth in women with multiple gestation and short cervical length. (See <a href=\"#H593829278\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for preterm labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a focused anatomical survey in the second trimester to screen for neural tube defects rather than serum screening. (See <a href=\"#H3396530570\" class=\"local\">'Screening for neural tube defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We offer genetic counseling to discuss their risk of aneuploidy in one or more fetuses. No serum marker or cell-free DNA screening test for aneuploidy has been validated in this population. Increased nuchal translucency (defined as greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age) has been validated as a screening test for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 but not for trisomy 13. (See <a href=\"#H3980473084\" class=\"local\">'Aneuploidy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal growth is monitored by ultrasound examination; initiation and frequency are guided by the type of placentation, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H2586557571\" class=\"local\">'Timing and frequency of ultrasound examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We diagnose fetal growth restriction by the same criteria used for singleton pregnancies. Discordant growth of multiples is usually defined as a 20 to 25 percent difference in sonographic estimated fetal weight (EFW) of the smaller compared with the larger fetus (difference of larger minus smaller EFW divided by larger EFW). Discordance may be a marker for structural or genetic anomalies, infection, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, or placenta-mediated disease. (See <a href=\"#H2536768121\" class=\"local\">'Fetal growth restriction or discordant growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple interventions have been investigated to reduce the risk for preterm delivery; none have proven efficacious; however, administration of corticosteroids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> may reduce neonatal morbidity from preterm birth. (See <a href=\"#H3171508403\" class=\"local\">'Preterm birth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prescribe low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> after 12 weeks of gestation to reduce the occurrence of preeclampsia and its associated complications (preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction). (See <a href=\"#H4280970512\" class=\"local\">'Preeclampsia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We screen for diabetes at the first prenatal visit and, if negative, again at 24 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"#H2131438638\" class=\"local\">'Gestational diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery timing is based on the type of amnionicity, irrespective of lung maturity. We deliver monoamniotic and diamniotic triplets at about 32+4 weeks of gestation (ie, between 32+0 and 32+6 weeks). Uncomplicated triplet pregnancies with three amniotic sacs, whether monochorionic, dichorionic, or trichorionic, are delivered between 35+0 and 35+6 weeks of gestation. Earlier delivery is indicated in complicated pregnancies; timing depends on the individual clinical scenario. (See <a href=\"#H4140048182\" class=\"local\">'Delivery timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest delivery by cesarean (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4150532205\" class=\"local\">'Route of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819763634\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge David C Jones, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/triplet-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Osterman MJ, et al.
