Stomatocytes (also called hydrocytes) contain a mouth-shaped area of central pallor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75535 \">picture 1</a>). Xerocytes (also called dessicocytes) are markedly hyperchromic RBCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62761 \">picture 2</a>). These morphologic changes imply a pathophysiologic process, as described below. (See <a href=\"#H1905391482\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Hereditary stomatocytosis (HSt) and hereditary xerocytosis (HX) are autosomal dominant inherited hemolytic conditions characterized by an excess of stomatocytes or xerocytes, respectively. Patients have variable degrees of hemolysis and anemia. In dehydrated HSt (also called stomatocytic xerocytosis) both abnormalities may be seen. Some syndromes with HSt cannot readily be distinguished from HX, and several intermediate forms of disease exist. The traditional classifications are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSt has been classified into four disorders:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overhydrated HSt</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dehydrated HSt</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cryohydrocytosis (CH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Familial pseudohyperkalemia (FP)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HX has been classified into three disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Classic HX</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stomatocytic HX</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HX with hyperphosphatidylcholine hemolytic anemia</p><p/><p>Genotype-phenotype correlations are increasingly being reported, and the classification may benefit from incorporation of this information. As an example, it has been established that dehydrated HSt and stomatocytic HX are essentially the same condition.</p><p>Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO), a benign condition not associated with anemia and characterized by increased rigidity of the red cell membrane, exhibits an increased number of stomatocytes in the peripheral smear. SAO is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary elliptocytosis and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1905391482\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1905391503\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of stomatocyte formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the normal biconcave disc becomes a uniconcave cup (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68313\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68313 \">picture 3</a>), a red blood cell (RBC) will appear as a stomatocyte on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75535 \">picture 1</a>). There are several mechanisms by which this change can occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hereditary stomatocytosis (HSt), the mechanism of stomatocyte formation often involves changes in cell volume caused by reduced intracellular ion content, as described below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases of acquired stomatocytosis and rare inherited conditions that affect lipid metabolism (see <a href=\"#H1905394646\" class=\"local\">'Other disorders with stomatocytes'</a> below), the mechanism of stomatocyte formation often involves either a decrease in RBC membrane surface area or qualitative changes in the composition of the membrane lipid bilayer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some healthy individuals, stomatocytes occasionally can be found on the peripheral blood smear. This is thought to be due to a drying artifact; hence, it is important to evaluate several different areas of the peripheral smear before determining that a patient has circulating stomatocytes.</p><p/><p>Information about the mechanism of stomatocyte formation has come from in vitro studies, which have led investigators to propose that a relative expansion of the inner leaflet of the bilayer relative to the outer leaflet may be responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This conclusion is based on studies in which the shapes of RBCs can be modified by exposure to amphiphilic agents (compounds that interact with both liquids [eg, cytoplasm] and lipids [eg, membranes]).</p><p>According to the Sheetz-Singer bilayer couples hypothesis, these compounds are thought to intercalate passively into the relatively negatively charged inner half of the membrane phospholipid bilayer, causing an inner bulging (ie, the beginning of the cup) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55556 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Endocytic vacuoles then form at the advancing mouth causing the loss of surface area that completes the transformation to a stomatocyte. Based on the theory of uncoupling of the membrane lipid bilayer, expansion of the inner leaflet leads to formation of stomatocytes, whereas expansion of the outer leaflet leads to echinocytes. However, other theories postulate that alterations in structure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of band 3 or other cytoskeletal protein may result in stomatocytic or echinocytic changes.</p><p>Finally, alterations in ion content are associated with stomatocytosis. In disorders characterized by overhydration of the RBCs, stomatocytosis may represent a step in the transformation of a discocyte into an overhydrated spherocyte, which is then followed by RBC fragmentation. In disorders characterized by dehydration of the red cell, stomatocytes may be a step in the generation of dehydrated spherocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> echinocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2866626948\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of xerocyte formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xerocytes form when cell solutes are lost, which then induces osmotic water loss (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of red blood cell hydration&quot;</a>). In xerocytosis, potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), the main intracellular cation, is lost. This may be associated with a slight increase in intracellular sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), but the net cation content of the RBC is significantly lower than in normal control RBCs. The dehydrated cells are more resistant to lysis when incubated in hypotonic solutions (ie, they have <strong>decreased</strong> osmotic fragility). The decreased osmotic fragility is due to the small baseline cell size. Xerocytes also exhibit a characteristic increase in cell rigidity and reduction in deformability, changes that are thought to play an important role in promoting hemolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1905391619\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of altered cell volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal intracellular cation in RBCs is K<sup>+</sup>, with smaller amounts of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. High K<sup>+</sup> and low Na<sup>+</sup> content are maintained by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, which actively transports Na<sup>+</sup> out of the cell and K<sup>+</sup> into the cell. This activity compensates for the passive diffusion of K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of red blood cell hydration&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the leakage of K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell exceeds the rate at which it is pumped back in, a low intracellular K<sup>+</sup> content and dehydration ensue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If the permeability of the membrane to Na<sup>+</sup> is abnormally high and the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is unable to fully compensate, the cells gain Na<sup>+</sup> with overhydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dehydration</strong> &ndash; Dehydration is associated with loss of intracellular cations (ie, K<sup>+</sup>), which in turn leads to osmotic water loss. Dehydrated stomatocytes are characterized by markedly decreased intracellular K<sup>+</sup> content with normal or increased intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (the amount of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> depends on how much the net Na<sup>+</sup> entry is increased and how much the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump can compensate).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dehydration also usually produces target cells, and pronounced dehydration produces xerocytes (dense, hyperchromic RBCs), which is reflected by a substantially increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62761 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dehydrated HSt (also called stomatocytic HX) has been linked to mutations in the genes encoding the Piezo1 and Gardos channels. (See <a href=\"#H1905392507\" class=\"local\">'Piezo1 channel'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1905392704\" class=\"local\">'Gardos channel'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overhydration</strong> &ndash; Overhydrated HSt is less common than dehydrated HSt. Overhydration occurs when cellular permeability to Na<sup>+</sup> increases (ie, a cation leak into the cell), leading to a marked increase in intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> that cannot be compensated for by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The increased intracellular cation content in turn causes an increase in cell water via an osmotic mechanism. The intracellular K<sup>+</sup> content is usually markedly reduced, by a mechanism that has not been determined. The resulting condition is called overhydrated HSt. Genetic defects responsible for overhydrated HSt include mutations in the Rhesus antigen-associated glycoprotein (<em>RhAG</em>) gene, which controls cation flux. (See <a href=\"#H1905392865\" class=\"local\">'RhAG'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cryohydrocytosis</strong> &ndash; Cryohydrocytosis is a rare form of overhydrated HSt associated with hemolysis of RBCs in vitro (when the cells are refrigerated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cryohydrocytes are RBCs that have a mild cation leak at body temperature but develop a marked increase in cation permeability at refrigerator temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, these RBCs become overhydrated when refrigerated; they may also form stomatocytes or microspherocytes in vitro, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leak sufficient K<sup>+</sup> into the plasma in the collection tube to cause pseudohyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>]. In some cases, mutations in band 3 have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p/><p>HSt associated with pseudohyperkalemia has been designated familial pseudohyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"#H1905393240\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pseudohyperkalemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1905392032\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise mechanisms leading to RBC hemolysis are largely unknown. In some patients, anemia is absent and hemolysis can be observed only in particular conditions, associated with increased mechanical stress to the RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>There is no reliable test that can estimate the propensity of an individual patient&rsquo;s RBCs to hemolyze in vivo. Osmotic fragility is classically increased in overhydrated HSt, but it is usually diminished in hereditary xerocytosis (HX).</p><p>A reduction in deformability leading to increased sensitivity to <span class=\"nowrap\">mechanical/shear</span> stress is believed to be a unifying link to hemolysis for all types of stomatocytosis; this has been quantified in the research setting by a variety of techniques. Osmotic gradient ektacytometry has been used to assess red cell deformability, but the availability of this technology for clinical use is very limited, and results do not necessarily predict the behavior of the RBCs in vivo. Less deformable RBCs are believed to be predisposed to become trapped in the microvasculature of the spleen and other organs of the reticuloendothelial <span class=\"nowrap\">(monocyte/macrophage)</span> system. This trapping can lead to increased phagocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> destruction, producing varying degrees of extravascular hemolysis. In vitro, these membrane deformability changes can be reversed by rehydrating xerocytes and decreasing the MCHC to normal levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>As with other forms of hemolysis associated with intrinsic RBC defects, the hemolysis in HSt and HX is nonimmune (ie, it is direct antiglobulin [Coombs] test [DAT] negative). Hemolysis is mostly extravascular, although there may be an intravascular component in severe cases. As an example, intravascular hemolysis was reported in a patient with HX during intensive exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1905392092\"><span class=\"h2\">Other RBC abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to hemolysis, the RBCs of patients with overhydrated HSt have been found to have a distinct set of metabolic abnormalities, alterations in adherence to the endothelium, and a deficiency in the stomatin protein.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Metabolic abnormalities described in RBCs of patients with overhydrated HSt have included increased adenosine diphosphate (ADP), reduced 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG, previously called 2,3-DPG), and enhanced oxygen affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Many of these findings are consistent with increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which is required to support the increased activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase required compensate for the increased Na<sup>+</sup> permeability. Other changes, such as increases in oxidized glutathione efflux, accumulation of glutamine and tryptophan, abnormal phosphatidylserine externalization, and decreases in creatine transport and concentration of ergothioneine, are also seen but the mechanism is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Membrane changes</strong> &ndash; Several RBC membrane abnormalities have been reported in various forms of HSt and HX. It is unclear whether these have any causal role in hemolysis or other clinical manifestations.

The abnormal stickiness of stomatocytes may play a role in the thromboembolic complications seen in these patients, particularly after splenectomy.

The function of stomatin is uncertain, but studies in mice suggest its deficiency alone does not cause stomatocytosis or hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/15,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>RBCs from some patients with HX have been reported to have a relative increase of membrane phosphatidylcholine, leading to the designation of &quot;HX with hyperphosphatidylcholine hemolytic anemia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/1,10,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,27-29</a>].

Prenatal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perinatal edema has been reported, which in rare cases have been associated with life-threatening hydrops fetalis.

Some individuals may have severe hemolytic anemia, others may have evidence of compensated hemolysis (ie, reticulocytosis sufficient to maintain a normal <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit</span> despite ongoing hemolysis), and others may have no evidence of hemolysis. An exception is familial pseudohyperkalemia, which is an asymptomatic carrier state that is not associated with clinical hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In neonates who present with hemolytic anemia, the severity may be great enough to necessitate neonatal exchange transfusion.

Once the artifactual nature of the hyperkalemia is established, no further intervention for this finding is needed, although it is useful to note in the medical record that blood should not be refrigerated prior to testing.

The most likely causes differ by age, ethnic background, and presence of other medical conditions. Some are also inherited, nonimmune disorders (eg, RBC enzymatic defects such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency or pyruvate kinase [PK] deficiency; <span class=\"nowrap\">membrane/cytoskeletal</span> defects such as hereditary spherocytosis [HS]); and others are acquired <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immune-mediated, such as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), which is due to maternal alloantibodies to fetal RBC antigens, or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is caused by an acquired loss of complement regulatory factors on the RBC surface. Like HSt and HX, these conditions may have anemia and laboratory findings consistent with hemolysis. Unlike HSt and HX, they typically have differing RBC morphologies on the peripheral blood smear (eg, predominance of spherocytes rather than stomatocytes or xerocytes), and specialized testing in these other conditions will reveal the alternative diagnosis.

Like HSt and HX, these conditions are inherited, and in some cases they are associated with anemia. These conditions are distinguished from HSt by specialized laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H1905394702\" class=\"local\">'Inherited defects affecting membranes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occasionally, acquired stomatocytosis may occur (eg, in individuals with alcohol intoxication or certain medications). Like HSt, these individuals may have anemia and stomatocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Unlike HSt, the appearance of stomatocytes is often transient.

Like dehydrated <span class=\"nowrap\">HSt/HX,</span> these conditions may be associated with nonimmune hemolytic anemia, which may be macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic depending on the defect. These conditions are distinguished from <span class=\"nowrap\">HSt/HX</span> by specialized laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary elliptocytosis and related disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to hemoglobin mutations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infantile pyknocytosis</strong> &ndash; Pyknocytes are hyperdense, dehydrated RBCs with irregular borders and varying numbers of projections. Infantile pyknocytosis is a condition that occurs in neonates, characterized by transient, nonimmune hemolytic anemia that resolves in infancy. The cause (and whether it is due to a genetic or environmental factor) is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. In one series that analyzed blood samples from 149 neonates with unexplained hemolytic anemia, pyknocytes were seen in 14 (9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Pyknocytes may also be seen in individuals with HE, in whom the elliptocytes may not appear until later in life. Like HSt and HX, infantile pyknocytosis can present with hemolytic anemia in infancy. Unlike HSt and HX, infantile pyknocytosis resolves within the first year of life, and the cause is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1905394316\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only limited data are available on the management of HSt and HX. In general, management is individualized according to the severity of hemolytic anemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Folate supplementation</strong> &ndash; Folate supplementation (typically 1 mg orally per day) is appropriate in individuals with chronic hemolysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfusions</strong> &ndash; Patients with mild or no hemolytic anemia are unlikely to require RBC transfusions. However, transfusions (or exchange transfusions in neonates) may be required in the setting of severe hemolysis. Additional information is presented separately according to patient age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessment of iron status</strong> &ndash; Assessment of iron status is appropriate in individuals with chronic hemolysis. This is especially important for individuals who have received multiple transfusions; however, iron overload can also occur in the absence of transfusion due to chronic hemolytic anemia. Typically, serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (the ratio of iron to transferrin) are measured at the time of diagnosis, with subsequent annual monitoring and testing based on the initial values. Individuals with evidence of iron overload may also have testing for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) mutations (eg, <em>HFE</em> mutations). For patients with HX who are not significantly anemic and who carry a genetic predisposition to iron overload (eg, an <em>HFE</em> mutation), phlebotomy may be appropriate when ferritin levels are significantly elevated above the normal range in the absence of concomitant inflammation or other known causes of increased ferritin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gallstones</strong> &ndash; Patients should be aware of the possibility of pigmented gallstones and the typical symptoms. Evaluation for symptoms is appropriate; we do not screen asymptomatic individuals in most cases. Assessment for and management of gallstones depends on clinical features and severity of the findings. Details are presented in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choledocholithiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with incidental gallstones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallstones in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Splenectomy</strong> &ndash; Splenectomy has been performed in individuals with severe hemolysis. However, there is limited evidence of therapeutic benefit, and the procedure has risks, including those associated with the surgery as well as risks of infection with encapsulated organisms. Individuals with HSt or HX who undergo splenectomy have a much greater risk of vascular complications including thromboembolic events <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaso-occlusive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/11,20,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20,50</a>]. Several case reports describe the development of pulmonary hypertension due to multiple thromboemboli following splenectomy in HSt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/11,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,50</a>]. Thus, splenectomy should be undertaken with extreme caution, especially in patients carrying the <em>PIEZO1</em> mutation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We generally reserve splenectomy as a last resort for patients who are unable to be treated with chronic transfusion.

Potential benefits of genetic testing include the ability to distinguish between affected and unaffected individuals in a family and identification of those who may require closer monitoring for hemolysis, especially at times of increased stress (eg, infections, hospitalizations); those who must avoid splenectomy, and those who may be at risk of iron overload due to the presence of <em>HFE</em> (hereditary hemochromatosis) mutations. In addition, information about the genetic defect may be useful for future enrollment in clinical trials <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for use of investigational or newly developed therapies that target a specific genetic defect.</p><p>However, genetic testing is not required for diagnosis, especially in patients who are asymptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> do not have evidence of ongoing hemolysis.</p><p>Issues related to prenatal evaluation, genetic counseling for family members, and genetic testing of children are discussed separately.

In most cases, the patient&rsquo;s presentation will suggest the most likely diagnosis. However, it may be possible to identify the condition due to the observation of stomatocytes on the peripheral blood smear. In one series of almost 4300 peripheral blood smears, a significant number of stomatocytes were identified in 100 (2.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>As noted above, stomatocytosis also can result as a drying artifact or peripheral blood smear preparation.

Patients may be identified during pretransfusion testing. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating that all antigens of the Rh system are absent from the RBC surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

The abnormal membrane lipids may be responsible for the stomatocytosis, as described below for stomatocytosis in the setting of acquired stomatocytosis.

Those with chronic hemolysis are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation. Patients should be monitored for the appearance of iron overload, especially if they carry additional predisposing mutations (eg, mutations in <em>HFE</em>). For most patients, we recommend not performing splenectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Splenectomy has been associated with several morbidities in these patients, including thromboembolic events and pulmonary hypertension, as well as the general risks of surgery and infections with encapsulated organisms; there is limited evidence of therapeutic benefit from splenectomy. We generally reserve splenectomy as a last resort for patients with severe hemolysis.
