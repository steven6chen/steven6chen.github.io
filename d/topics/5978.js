However, in doing so liver function may ultimately become impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There has been exciting progress in understanding hepatic fibrosis, which represents a paradigm for wound healing in other tissues, including skin, lung, and kidney, since it involves many of the same cell types and mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. An understanding of these mechanisms has a number of clinical implications, including the development of interventions designed to impede or reverse hepatic fibrosis, some of which are already available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Perhaps the greatest change in the field of antifibrotic therapy has been the intense focus on NASH as a therapeutic target, reflecting the growing appreciation of this disease as a public health threat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], combined with the realization that with cures for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the majority of patients due to direct acting antiviral therapies, fewer HCV and hepatitis B virus patients will need antifibrotic therapies, although in reality cirrhosis due to HCV remains a large unmet need [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This topic review will focus on possible future treatments aimed at impeding or reversing fibrosis. The pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hepatic-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FIBROSIS REVERSIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact moment at which fibrosis becomes irreversible is unknown, either in terms of a histologic marker or a specific change in the matrix composition or content. Dense cirrhosis with nodule formation, portal hypertension, and early liver failure is generally considered irreversible, but less advanced lesions can show remarkable reversibility when the underlying cause of the liver injury is controlled and possibly by other therapeutic interventions. In studies of patients with hepatitis B hepatitis C, and NASH, up to 70 percent of patients had reversal of cirrhosis following successful antiviral therapies or bariatric surgery, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>The development of targeted therapies is moving closer to reality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50384 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. The ideal drug would be the one which could be easily delivered, is well tolerated, has high liver specificity, and promotes the resorption of excess interstitial matrix without abolishing the salutary effects of the normal hepatic extracellular matrix. The hope is not necessarily to eliminate fibrosis entirely, but rather to attenuate its development so that patients with chronic liver disease do not succumb to the end organ failure that it creates (eg, portal hypertension, ascites, liver failure). While no therapy yet meets these goals, the framework for developing such treatments is in place and progress is accelerating.</p><p>As a general rule, the currently available antifibrotic therapies have been directed against suppressing hepatic inflammation or injury rather than subduing fibrosis. However, targeting of stellate cells and fibrogenic mediators has emerged as an equally promising complement to therapies that reduce injury. Points of therapeutic intervention may include efforts to remove the injurious stimuli, suppress hepatic inflammation, downregulate stellate cell activation, and promote matrix degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">REMOVE INJURIOUS STIMULI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Removing the underlying cause of liver injury is the most effective way to prevent fibrosis. This approach is effective when instituted early, but can also reverse fibrosis when patients are cirrhotic. Examples include removal of excess iron or copper in genetic hemochromatosis or Wilson disease, respectively, abstinence in alcoholic liver disease, anthelminthic therapy in schistosomiasis, suppression of hepatitis B (HBV) or cure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronic viral hepatitis, biliary decompression in bile duct obstruction, and bariatric surgery in NASH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/1,2,8,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,11-14</a>]. In the future, identification of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis may permit the elimination of bile duct injury and periductular fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Discontinuation of hepatotoxic drugs may prevent progression of drug-induced liver injury and fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Fibrosis reversibility'</a> above.)</p><p>Because of the high worldwide prevalence of HBV or HCV, there are public health efforts underway to clear these viruses in chronically infected patients. As noted above, data have established that clearance of hepatitis C can lead to remarkable improvement in liver histology and clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/7,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17-19</a>]. Improvement may be associated with reduced hepatic venous pressure gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], which is an important determinant of decompensation risk in patients with advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An improved clinical outcome is much more likely in patients who demonstrate some decrease in fibrosis after HCV clearance, compared with those with no evidence of decreased fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Similarly, sustained suppression of HBV with oral antiviral therapies has been associated with remarkable histologic improvement. In an illustrative study, more than 70 percent of patients on long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a> showed improvement in fibrosis scores over a 240-week treatment period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Similar observations were made in a study of patients with chronic HBV treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fibrosis and cirrhosis may also be substantially improved with interferon therapy in patients with delta hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. One study found that HBV genotype C was associated accelerated fibrosis compared with other genotypes, possibly warranting earlier treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The success of direct acting antiviral therapies for HCV, which are yielding cures in &gt;90 percent of patients with advanced fibrosis, is expected to lead to greater understanding of how the liver restores a normal architecture and resorbs fibrosis following clearance of this insult.</p><p>Finally, with the growing use of bariatric surgery in morbid obesity, evidence of reduced fibrogenesis and improved fibrosis has begun to emerge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPRESS HEPATIC INFLAMMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory mediators may stimulate stellate cell activation in chronic liver diseases such as viral or autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury. Thus, antiinflammatory medications might be beneficial in preventing fibrosis in these conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroids have been a mainstay of therapy for many inflammatory liver diseases. As an example, they can induce clinical remission and improve hepatic histopathology in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, even those with advanced histologic features. However, the incomplete suppression of fibrogenesis and undesirable side effects after prolonged administration limit its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1924106232\"><span class=\"h2\">Caffeine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic evidence has consistently revealed a protective effect of caffeine on fibrosis among patients with chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-33</a>]. While not strictly an antifibrotic, experimental data suggest that adenosine blockade, which is one of the effects of caffeine, may limit fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Colchicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consideration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> as an antifibrotic is largely of historical interest only in the new area of antifibrotic therapies. In clinical trials of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, colchicine improved laboratory values but mortality and transplantation rate were unaffected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.) In another trial, colchicine improved overall survival of patients with cirrhosis but did not reduce the mortality related specifically to liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Despite the uncertainty and lack of convincing data, colchicine is still being used by some clinicians. One study suggested that its metabolite, colchicine, may have better antifibrotic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, a meta-analysis of colchicine trials showed no benefit and thus it cannot be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ursodeoxycholic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) has clear efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Although no direct antifibrotic effect of UDCA is established in humans, a benefit in a rat model of bile duct ligation has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

In addition to aiding in defense against viral infections, NK cells can ameliorate hepatic fibrosis by killing activated stellate cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. This process is associated with the release of two antifibrotic cytokines, interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Interestingly, alcohol has a dampening effect on these antifibrotic qualities of NK cells, which could account for the accelerated fibrosis in the setting of alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Thus, new approaches to antifibrotic therapies could exploit strategies that foster and promote NK cell surveillance or activate downstream signaling pathways that NK cells use to clear activated stellate cells. Experimental studies in rodents support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], but any human studies of this type are years away.</p><p>More recently, dendritic cells have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Thus, they may represent another immune cell type that could be a target for antifibrotic therapies.</p><p>Because Jun kinase regulates many inflammatory pathways in liver injury, antagonism of this intracellular signaling mediator has generated interest, a prospect supported by animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Additional antiinflammatory drugs may include those that alter macrophage activation or attenuate inflammatory signaling. These include a serum amyloid P multimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and a carbohydrate antagonist of galectin-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], as well as colony stimulating factor-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Also, antagonists to lysophosphatidic acid have generated enthusiasm because of their apparent safety, and antifibrotic trials are anticipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Chemokines are chemotactic proteins that transduce their signals through G-coupled protein receptors (GPCRs), a class of molecules that are especially appealing as drug targets. Moreover, animal studies show evidence of efficacy by chemokine receptor antagonists in a range of models<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>], which has led to ongoing human trials in patients with NASH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATOPROTECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A relatively new class of drugs, broadly referred to as &quot;hepatoprotectants,&quot; is showing considerable promise in preclinical and clinical studies. This includes hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), HGF deletion variants, and HGF synthetic and insulin-like growth factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-65</a>]. In addition, a small molecule caspase inhibitor improved aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in patients with chronic HCV and is currently in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Although caspase inhibitors have the potential to reduce hepatic injury, there are no ongoing trials using this class of drugs due to reports of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>] or toxicity in preclinical (ie, animal) studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatocyte growth factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is experimental support for the antifibrotic effect of HGF in animal models of fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. Mechanisms of its antifibrotic activity include suppression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, induction of collagenase expression, growth inhibition and apoptosis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and blocking of biliary epithelial cells from undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/62,63,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63,71</a>].</p><p>HGF also appears to inhibit TGF-beta from activating its downstream targets, thereby suppressing TGF-beta mediated transcription of collagen type I in activated HSCs. This effect is mediated by increased interaction between galectin-7 and phosphorylated Smad3, effectively sequestering the p-Smad3 to the cytoplasm and preventing collagen promoter activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Although animal studies of HGF clearly demonstrate its antifibrotic potential, because it is a mitogen there remains concern that it could promote carcinogenesis in the long term. On the other hand, there are data suggesting that HGF could act as a tumor suppressor based on an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Thus, further studies are expected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Caspase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apoptosis of hepatocytes is recognized as an inflammatory stimulus that is profibrogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/74-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-77</a>]. As a result, small molecules have been developed that specifically block caspases, key intracellular effectors of apoptotic signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The main theoretical concern is that blocking this pathway (which removes cells that may have acquired DNA damage) will lead to an increased risk of malignancy. Some clinical trials of these agents have been halted while others are continuing, although no significant adverse toxicity had been reported in patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FARNESOID X RECEPTOR LIGANDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor transcription factor family that can be activated by binding of bile acids. The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obeticholic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obeticholic acid</a>, an FXR ligand, which may be attributable to a broad anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activity, has now been established in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is the most active endogenous ligand. FXR has been implicated in regulating genes controlling bile flow and secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. An additional, novel role for FXR was uncovered with its identification in stellate cells, where it downregulates cellular activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In these studies, CDCA showed a significant antifibrotic effect in animal models. FXR ligands may also reduce stellate cell contractility, raising the potential for attenuating portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. More recently, agonists of FXR have been proposed to improve hepatocyte integrity, with clinical trials underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].</p><p>In vivo and in vitro evidence suggested that FXR ligands upregulate small heterodimer partner (SHP) in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and markedly reduce collagen I levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Furthermore, the FXR-SHP cascade effectively inhibits tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 expression in stellate cells, mediated by interaction of SHP with JunD, resulting in the inability of JunD to bind the TIMP-1 promoter. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 activity levels are also increased by 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>The inhibition of TIMP-1 is pivotal for two reasons: first, metalloprotease activity will no longer be inhibited, and second, stellate cells lose the crucial survival signals they receive from TIMP-1 (see above). Interestingly, FXR ligands can reverse the downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma in stellate cells in models of rodent liver fibrosis (porcine serum, CCl<sub>4</sub> and bile duct ligation), and submaximal effective doses of PPAR-gamma agonists and FXR ligands synergistically reduce levels of collagen type I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Combination targeting of these two pathways could reduce the likelihood of side effects resulting from higher doses of a PPAR-gamma agonist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">DOWNREGULATE STELLATE CELL ACTIVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppression or reversal of stellate cell activation has inherent attractiveness as a therapeutic strategy because of the central role that stellate cells have in fibrogenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hepatic-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antifibrotic effects of the interferons were anticipated because they downregulate collagen gene transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This effect was hypothesized to explain the improvement in fibrosis seen in some studies of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) treated with interferon who did not achieve a sustained virologic response. Unfortunately, such a benefit was not confirmed in a large, multicenter clinical trial of maintenance interferon therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p>Interferon gamma is another interferon that has inhibitory effects on hepatic stellate cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. It also reduces the expression of mRNAs of type I and IV collagen as well as fibronectin in activated hepatic stellate cells grown in tissue culture, inhibits stellate cell proliferation, and reduces smooth muscle actin expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, a randomized controlled trial was also negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Efforts to target gamma interferon delivery to stellate cells could resurrect this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Cannabinoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cannabinoids have emerged as an attractive pathway for antagonizing hepatic fibrosis. There are two identified cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), both of which are G-protein coupled receptors.</p><p>The CB1 receptor is induced primarily in hepatic stellate cells as they activate into myofibroblasts during liver injury. Antagonism of CB1 in an acute model of injury due to CCl<sub>4</sub> or in isolated cells leads to decreased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-1 (the most potent fibrogenic cytokine), reduced cellular proliferation, and increased myofibroblast apoptosis, all of which would effectively reduce fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Clinical trials of the drug rimonabant, a CB1 antagonist, were halted, and the drug was withdrawn from the market due to a high incidence of severe depression, a predictable consequence of central CB1 blockade. However, the development of peripheral CB1 receptor antagonists that do not cross the blood brain barrier has led to renewed enthusiasm for antagonizing CB1 signaling in liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. </p><p>Studies in human stellate cells demonstrate that activation of CB2 is antifibrogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Stimulation of cultured stellate cells with an endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, provokes stellate cell death, albeit through a CB2 ligand-independent pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In contrast to CB1 signaling, the CB2 pathway is antifibrotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Thus, agonists rather than antagonists to this pathway can reduce collagen accumulation in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Interestingly, endogenous opioids, like cannabinoids, have profibrogenic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

Silymarin functions as an antioxidant and may decrease hepatic injury via cytoprotection and inhibition of Kupffer cell function.

A concern related to inhibiting TGF-beta is that it may promote inflammation and hepatocellular growth or reduce apoptosis, the clinical consequences of which will need to be evaluated.</p><p>Because global inhibition of TGF-beta is not deemed to be sufficiently safe since it is also a tumor suppressor, targeted antagonism of the cytokine at the cell surface has emerged as a more appealing strategy. Antagonists to integrins, which contribute to TGF-beta activation, have been proposed with good evidence of efficacy in animal models for antagonism of alpha V beta 6 integrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>] and the alpha V subunit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

By contrast, antibodies to TIMP can attenuate fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-hepatic-fibrosis/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>].

This success is likely to be built around more accurate and less invasive endpoints of clinical trials, which currently remain the single biggest limitation in the implementation of clinical trials for fibrosis therapy, since many attractive candidate compounds are available for testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116516461\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact moment at which hepatic fibrosis becomes irreversible is unknown, either in terms of a histologic marker or a specific change in the matrix composition or content.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available antifibrotic therapies attack all elements of liver disease, including inflammation, hepatocyte injury, cytokines stellate cells, and matrix degradation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the future, targeting of stellate cells and fibrogenic mediators will be a mainstay of therapy.
