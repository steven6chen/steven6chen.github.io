Patients may manifest postpartum blues consisting of mild depressive symptoms that are generally self-limited, or more severe syndromes such as unipolar major depression. Untreated postpartum major depression can result in both short- and long-term negative consequences for the mother and infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the general principles of treating postpartum unipolar major depression.

Communication among all of the involved clinicians is important to give consistent messages to increase uptake of treatment. </p><p>The sections below describe some general principles and issues that are involved in treating postpartum unipolar major depression. Information about the principles of treating unipolar depression in the general population of adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis#H221202\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults and initial treatment: General principles and prognosis&quot;, section on 'General principles'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430239490\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women who are considering treatment for perinatal depression prefer to receive help at their obstetrics clinic, either from the obstetrician or a mental health clinician located at the clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Randomized trials indicate that depressed patients, including women with perinatal depressive symptoms, can benefit from collaborative (integrated) care that is administered at an obstetrics and gynecology clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Collaborative care involves a team of clinicians, such as an obstetrician, case manager, and mental health specialist, who work together to provide pharmacotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychotherapy. </p><p>Severely ill patients typically require hospitalization. Jointly admitting the mother and infant to a mother-baby unit can facilitate breastfeeding and teaching parenting skills to mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These units also allow the treatment team to observe mother-infant interactions and to work with the mother on improving her relationship with her child. These units are more available in Australia and Europe than the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176466009\"><span class=\"h2\">History of prior treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important assess the benefit of previous therapies in order to guide treatment selection for postpartum unipolar major depression. Patients who were successfully treated with a particular psychotherapy or antidepressant prior to or during pregnancy should generally receive the same therapy or drug for postpartum depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2355146674\"><span class=\"h2\">Educating patients and families</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For postnatal unipolar major depression, we recommend psychoeducation for the patient and family despite limited evidence of its efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Educating patients about depression is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Psychoeducation includes information about the symptoms and course of depression as well as treatment options. The discussion about treating postpartum depression should include information about the potential risks of untreated depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment#H1181242621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe postpartum unipolar major depression: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Weighing the risks'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients are encouraged to get adequate rest, maintain a consistent sleep-wake cycle, utilize supports, reduce stressors when possible, and continue prepregnancy exercise routines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period#H3906168246\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period&quot;, section on 'Postpartum women'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1126352813\"><span class=\"h2\">Adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor adherence is common among patients with psychiatric disorders, including postpartum depression. Barriers to care include cost, logistics, not trusting clinicians, and stigma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1998851117\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely monitor patients treated for postnatal depression, using the self-report, 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67741%7EOBGYN%2F81407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67741 graphicRef81407 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The scale can be completed in less than five minutes in the waiting room immediately before seeing the clinician. Although the instrument was originally developed as a screening tool, we find it is also useful for monitoring response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Items asking about the somatic symptoms of depression such as sleep and appetite are not included in the scale because these symptoms are common in postpartum women who are not depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The scale is acceptable to most women and clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], easy to score, and is available in over 50 languages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Responses are scored 0, 1, 2, or 3, with a maximum score of 30. In studies that evaluated the instrument as a screening tool, scores &ge;12 or 13 identified most women with major depression. However, many studies used a cutoff score of &ge;10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>A reasonable alternative to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is the self-report, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">form 1</a>). However, the Patient Health Questionnaire includes items about appetite, energy, and sleep, which may reflect the physical effects of the puerperium rather than depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>General information about monitoring patients during treatment of depression is discussed separately.

Patients are monitored for adverse effects that may occur due to increased serum drug concentrations after delivery. Medication levels can rise because of postpartum pharmacokinetic changes that stem from decreased plasma volume and decreased hepatic enzyme activity. </p><p>For patients who start pharmacotherapy after delivery, drug doses are similar to those used in the general population of patients with depression. Patients concerned about adverse effects can be started on lower doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> rather than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. Many patients will require the dose to be titrated up; one randomized trial found that among patients who remitted with sertraline, the dose generally ranged between 100 and 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Monotherapy at higher doses is preferred over medication combinations at lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Additional information about antidepressant doses is discussed separately.
