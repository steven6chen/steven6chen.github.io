This conversion is mediated by 21-hydroxylase, or in current terminology, P450 21A2, encoded by the <em>CYP21A2</em> gene. This results in 1) impaired cortisol biosynthesis and adrenal insufficiency, and 2) adrenal hyperandrogenism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81907 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Patients with &quot;classic&quot; or the most severe form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) present during the neonatal period and early infancy with adrenal insufficiency with or without salt losing or as toddlers with virilization.

It is therefore important to plan for the transition from pediatric to adult care and to address issues that arise after puberty. These include sexual dysfunction, hyperandrogenic symptoms (in women), infertility, and long-term complications of the disease and chronic glucocorticoid therapy, such as obesity, short stature, bone loss, and impaired quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].

Bedtime administration of 0.25 to 1 mg is the most effective regimen for ACTH suppression but does not replace the cortisol deficiency well. Liquid forms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> and dexamethasone are available for precise titration of small doses.</p><p>Combination therapy, with typical doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> to replace the cortisol deficiency during the day and a very small dose of a long-acting glucocorticoid at bedtime (1 to 2 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>; 0.1 to 0.25 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>), is very effective in keeping ACTH low and minimizes glucocorticoid exposure. We suggest this approach when standard hydrocortisone regimens are ineffective. &quot;Inverse diurnal rhythm&quot; dosing, in which the larger dose is given at bedtime (ie, methylprednisolone 2 mg on arising and 6 mg at bedtime), does not replace the cortisol deficiency well, overtreats during the night, and should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4221916233\"><span class=\"h3\">Stress dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any form of adrenal insufficiency, patients with classic 21OHD should be provided with sick-day rules for stress dosing, medical alert identification, and injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> hemisuccinate (or other glucocorticoid) for emergencies.

Excessive dosing can induce hypertension and hypokalemia, as seen in any form of primary mineralocorticoid excess (see <a href=\"#H2944638628\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring therapy'</a> below). Optimal mineralocorticoid replacement has the added advantage of sometimes permitting the glucocorticoid dose to be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The need for mineralocorticoids typically decreases after infancy but remains relatively stable during adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Underdosing can lead to chronic volume depletion that can be clinically inapparent or cause chronic fatigue but also results in persistent overproduction of renin and angiotensin II.

Many men will self-discontinue all treatment for months to years without apparent consequence, as long as they do not suffer a significant concurrent illness.</p><p>This resilience should not be interpreted as escape from cortisol deficiency, which becomes evident when an illness precipitates a major catastrophe. In addition, patients who are undertreated and in chronic poor control develop testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs), which are difficult to treat and often cause irreversible consequences. Thus, adherence to therapy is essential in all men with classic 21OHD. (See <a href=\"#H3092800708\" class=\"local\">'Testicular adrenal rest tumors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044090598\"><span class=\"h4\">Infertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sperm production is often impaired in men with poorly controlled classic 21OHD for two reasons. First, adrenal-derived androgens suppress gonadotropins and subsequent testosterone production from Leydig cells. High adrenal-derived androgen production compensates for attendant hypogonadism and, paradoxically, maintains male secondary sexual characteristics, creating the false impression that testicular function is normal. Second, roughly half of these men develop TARTs. A study from Germany found abnormal semen analysis in 100 percent of 22 men with classic 21OHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a larger study from London of 50 men with classic 21OHD, 48 percent had severe oligospermia, and 59 percent of the 17 who desired to be fertile required treatment intensification to improve sperm production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3092800708\"><span class=\"h4\">Testicular adrenal rest tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with classic 21OHD are prone to develop TARTs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oligospermia, especially when control is poor. The pathogenesis of TARTs is not known, but TARTs are believed to be derived from ectopic adrenal cortex remnants in the testis or from reprogrammed Leydig stem cells, which differentiate and grow under the influence of chronically elevated ACTH. The mass effect increases the intratesticular pressure, impairs blood flow to the normal testis, and hinders outflow of semen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-clinical-presentation-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and clinical presentation of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency&quot;, section on 'Male reproduction'</a>.)</p><p>TARTs are firm, irregular masses originating near the rete testes, are typically bilateral, and can be painful when large. Multiple studies have shown that 30 to 50 percent of adolescent and adult males with classic 21OHD develop TART, and ultrasonography is the most sensitive method of detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/8,9,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,20,21</a>]. Intensified glucocorticoid therapy, but not surgery, might restore fertility.</p><p>Intensified glucocorticoid treatment is sometimes, but not always, effective for decreasing the size of TARTs and relieving pain. Case reports have noted either a decrease in size or even disappearance of testicular masses with supraphysiologic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> or with daytime <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> plus bedtime dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The best approach to prevent TARTs is to maintain treatment in adolescent boys and men with adequate replacement glucocorticoids and to avoid long lapses in treatment.</p><p>Surgical removal provides good long-term control of TART growth and pain, but as demonstrated in a series from Rotterdam of eight patients with TART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], testicular testosterone production and sperm production rarely, if ever, occurs postoperatively. The presence of TART and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are poor prognostic factors for fertility in men with 21OHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>We suggest testicular ultrasound screening beginning in adolescence to detect TARTs, including one at the time of transition to adult care.

A normal semen analysis is the best evidence of good disease control without overtreatment, and sperm banking may be considered in young men who express a desire to preserve their fertility.
