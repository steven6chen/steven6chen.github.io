In epidemiologic studies conducted in Korea, England, and Austria, between 14 and 39 percent of the population had hemorrhoids; however, many were without symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Hemorrhoids without any symptoms do not require treatment. </p><p>By contrast, an estimated 10 million people in the United States complained of hemorrhoids, corresponding to a prevalence of 4.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most common complaint associated with hemorrhoidal disease is painless rectal bleeding during defecation with or without tissue prolapse. Other typical symptoms include anal pruritus or pain and a lump at the anal verge due to thrombosis or strangulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Those presenting to their physicians for symptomatic hemorrhoids probably represent a group with relatively severe disease. Because a large variety of over-the-counter products are available and marketed for the treatment of hemorrhoids, patients often self-diagnose and self-treat before seeking medical attention. Incidentally, the quality of information about hemorrhoids on the internet is highly variable, and a significant proportion of websites assessed are poorly informed (40 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]).</p><p>Several options are available for the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids, and most patients with low-grade internal hemorrhoids will have relief with home-based conservative treatment or office-based procedures that are reviewed in this topic. Surgery is indicated for low-grade hemorrhoids that are refractory to home- or office-based treatments, high-grade hemorrhoids, and complicated hemorrhoids. Surgical treatment of hemorrhoids is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H128870939\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF HEMORRHOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhoids are classified relative to their relationship to the dentate line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80650\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80650 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Internal</strong> hemorrhoids are proximal to or above the dentate line. Tissues above the dentate line receive visceral innervation, which is less sensitive to pain and irritation. Thus, internal hemorrhoids are amenable to a variety of office-based procedures that can be carried out with minimal or no anesthesia. Internal hemorrhoids are further subclassified into four grades based on the degree of prolapse from the anal canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113938 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>External</strong> hemorrhoids are distal to or below the dentate line, where tissues are innervated somatically, and therefore are more sensitive to pain and irritation. As a result, symptomatic external hemorrhoids that are refractory to conservative management are generally treated surgically under anesthesia, with the exception of small, acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids, which can sometimes be treated in the office.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed</strong> internal and external hemorrhoids straddle the dentate line and are generally treated in the same way as are external hemorrhoids. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2908561537\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACHES BY SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients generally complain of hemorrhoids for one of four symptoms:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124893909\"><span class=\"h2\">Irritation or pruritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritation or pruritus from internal or external hemorrhoids (no bleeding or thrombosis) can be treated with a variety of analgesic creams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> suppositories, and warm sitz baths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103146 \">table 1</a>). These treatments, particularly hydrocortisone, should not be used for longer than one week since side effects may occur, such as contact dermatitis with analgesic creams or mucosal atrophy with steroid creams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. If there is no improvement after one week, other nonsteroidal creams can be tried. (See <a href=\"#H662041969\" class=\"local\">'Medications for symptomatic relief'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1181632595\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding hemorrhoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External hemorrhoids generally do not bleed, unless a patient has spontaneously evacuated a thrombosed hemorrhoid; it is usually self-limited. Treatment of bleeding hemorrhoids is initially conservative, such as with dietary modification or external creams (see <a href=\"#H813383083\" class=\"local\">'Conservative treatment for all patients'</a> below). Persistently bleeding internal hemorrhoids can be treated using office-based procedures (eg, rubber band ligation). For external hemorrhoids, the only alternative is surgery since external hemorrhoids are not amenable to banding. (See <a href=\"#H438681270\" class=\"local\">'Office-based procedures for symptomatic hemorrhoids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3841871586\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombosed hemorrhoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis is usually associated with pain. Organization and resorption of clot occurs within several days following thrombosis of internal or external hemorrhoids, lessening the degree of pain. Conservative treatment of thrombosed hemorrhoids is usually sufficient. Exceptions include those with severe pain and thrombosed external hemorrhoids, and the rare case of concomitant thrombosis of external and internal hemorrhoids (sometimes seen after childbirth). It is important to appreciate that thrombosis of grades III and IV internal hemorrhoids usually persists after the conservative therapies outlined above and may require definitive treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease#H456751273\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease&quot;, section on 'Thrombosed external hemorrhoids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531315529\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internal hemorrhoids are graded from I to IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113938 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.) </p><p>As the grade becomes worse, there is a greater benefit to office-based procedures or surgery. For grade III hemorrhoid, one can first try rubber band ligation, which is often successful after one or two applications (see <a href=\"#H438681270\" class=\"local\">'Office-based procedures for symptomatic hemorrhoids'</a> below). If the rubber band ligation is not effective, then surgery is recommended. For grade IV hemorrhoids, surgery is the best treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease#H103488979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H813383083\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT FOR ALL PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment approach to most patients with new-onset symptomatic hemorrhoids is conservative, consisting of <span class=\"nowrap\">dietary/lifestyle</span> modification and topical or oral medications to relieve symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103146 \">table 1</a>). Conservative treatment is successful for most patients and can be continued for as long as the patient wishes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103367213\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary and lifestyle modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is strong evidence from multiple randomized trials that increased fiber intake improves symptoms of hemorrhoid bleeding and mild prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The other recommendations for dietary and lifestyle modifications are based on common sense rather than data. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should ingest 20 to 30 g of insoluble fiber per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103146 \">table 1</a>) and drink plenty of water (1.5 to 2 liters per day). Both are necessary to produce regular, soft stools, which reduce straining at defecation. It could take six weeks to fully realize the beneficial effect of fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many commercially available fiber supplements are available to reduce constipation. Many contain either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>. Neither has been shown to have a particular advantage over the other in treating hemorrhoidal disease. For patients who are unwilling to take fiber supplements, a detailed listing of the fiber content of various foods can be helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82094 \">table 2</a>). Because fiber has other salutary effects, is safe to use, and may help to prevent recurrence, we recommend augmentation of fiber in the diet indefinitely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adding fiber to the diet is beneficial for patients with bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. A 2005 Cochrane meta-analysis of seven trials found that fiber supplementation decreased hemorrhoid bleeding (risk reduction [RR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.68) and overall symptoms (eg, prolapse, pain, or itch; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32-0.68) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In an illustrative study, supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> for six weeks was associated with improvement in bleeding compared with untreated controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a later trial, 50 patients with bleeding internal hemorrhoids were randomly assigned to receive either a commercially available fiber preparation (<em>Plantago ovata</em>) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Endoscopy was performed before and after treatment. After 15 days of treatment, those who had received fiber supplementation had significantly fewer bleeding episodes and a reduction in the number of hemorrhoids seen on endoscopy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefit of fiber for irritation, pruritus, or prolapse is less well established than for bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fiber supplementation may relieve pruritus related to fecal soilage since the bulking effect of fiber may reduce leakage of liquid stool.

Although a popular myth, eating spicy food (eg, red hot chili peppers) had no effect on hemorrhoid symptoms such as irritation and pruritus in a controlled study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662041969\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications for symptomatic relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous medications, many over-the-counter, are available to treat hemorrhoids. Commonly used medications for hemorrhoids include oral or local analgesics to treat pain, topical agents to reduce local swelling or treat contact dermatitis, therapies to reduce sphincter spasm, and venoactive agents (phlebotonics) to increase venous tone of hemorrhoidal tissues. Each of these may be effective for treating one or more of the symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease (ie, irritation, pruritus, bleeding, thrombosis, pain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103146 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, data on long-term efficacy or side effects are lacking, with a few exceptions. There is high-quality evidence that phlebotonics (eg, flavonoid, hydroxyethylrutoside, calcium dobesilate) can improve hemorrhoid symptoms such as itch and bleeding. The use of phlebotonics for hemorrhoids is common in Europe and Asia but not North America. Other medical therapies for symptomatic hemorrhoid disease are poorly studied in the medical literature. The choice of these medications is informed more by marketing and patient perception than by actual evidence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2727784815\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical analgesics and steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical ointments containing anesthetics, steroids, emollients, and antiseptics are often self-prescribed by the patients for quick symptomatic relief. However, there is a lack of strong scientific evidence that supports the use of topical ointments.</p><p>Topical ointments that include analgesics, such as mixed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>,</span> are effective for relieving acute pain associated with hemorrhoids. However, topical ointments should not be used for longer than one week to avoid adverse effects such as contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Topical steroids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cream or suppository, may shrink the hemorrhoids and relieve the associated pruritus but have not been well evaluated for effectiveness in treating thrombosed hemorrhoids. If used, some experts suggest applying cream rather than using suppositories. Steroid cream should be applied twice a day for no more than seven days. Long-term use should be avoided because of potential thinning of perianal and anal mucosa and increasing risk of injury. If symptoms persistent, an alternative nonsteroidal ointment should be used.

Phlebotonics have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the indication of hemorrhoids.</p><p>Phlebotonics are a heterogenous class of drugs consisting of plant extracts (ie, flavonoids such as hydroxyethylrutoside) and synthetic compounds (eg, calcium dobesilate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because phlebotonics improve venous tone, microvascular permeability, lymphatic activity, and microcirculatory nutritive flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], they may reduce bleeding associated with hemorrhoids. Some studies have found that hydroxyethylrutoside reduces acute and recurrent hemorrhoidal attacks, including those in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. However, many of the studies had important methodological limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>A 2012 Cochrane review of 24 randomized trials showed a significant beneficial effect of phlebotonics for outcomes such as pruritus (odds ratio [OR] 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.79), bleeding (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.37), and overall symptomatic improvement (OR 15.99, 95% CI 5.97-42.84) but less for pain (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The common objective of these therapies is to cause sloughing of excess hemorrhoidal tissue; healing and scarring then fixes the residual tissue to the underlying anorectal muscular ring. In a 2005 Cochrane review of three randomized trials, surgical hemorrhoidectomy was associated with more pain (relative risk 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.33) and complications (relative risk 6.32, 95% CI 1.15-34.89) than rubber band ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. &#160;</p><p>For patients with symptomatic grade I, II, or III internal hemorrhoids refractory to conservative treatment, we recommend an office-based procedure, rather than surgical hemorrhoidectomy, as the initial intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113938 \">figure 2</a>). Although some surgeons feel that grade III internal hemorrhoids, especially those with multiple pedicles, should be treated surgically, we recommend attempting rubber band ligation at least once. The recovery after rubber band ligation is vastly easier than after hemorrhoidectomy. If rubber band ligation fails to control symptoms adequately, surgery can then be offered.</p><p>Patients with internal hemorrhoids of any grade <strong>and</strong> additional anorectal problems, external hemorrhoids, or mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">internal/external</span> hemorrhoids should proceed directly to surgery, as those conditions are not amenable to office-based treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104856039\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of office-based technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commonly performed office-based procedures include rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation of internal hemorrhoids, and excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. The choice first depends on local availability. When local expertise is available for more than one procedure, we suggest the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/1,11,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For healthy patients with grade I, II, or III internal hemorrhoids, we recommend rubber band ligation rather than another procedure.

This technique is effective, inexpensive, easy to perform, and only rarely causes serious complications. </p><p>Patients with grade II or III internal hemorrhoids are the best candidates for rubber band ligation. External tags and external hemorrhoids are <strong>not</strong> to be treated with this technique, as it would cause excruciating pain. Banding procedures are typically contraindicated in patients with coagulopathies and those on anticoagulation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) or antiplatelet (eg, Plavix) medications, and patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, because of the risk of significant delayed hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In the authors' experience, patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy can safely undergo rubber band ligation, with a low risk of bleeding. Banding is relatively contraindicated in immunocompromised patients (eg, chemotherapy administration, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS)</span> because of risks of infection and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H104856039\" class=\"local\">'Choice of office-based technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H317080189\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised patients'</a> below.)</p><p>When performed properly, this procedure does not require any anesthesia (local or intravenous). Usually, only one hemorrhoidal column should be treated at a time to minimize excessive tissue necrosis. However, if the patient tolerates the procedure with only minimal discomfort, then several hemorrhoids can be banded during the same session. As many as three bands in a single column may be safely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. If multiple sessions are needed, then repeat banding procedures can be performed in three- to four-week intervals to allow any swelling and ulcerations to subside. Many patients complain of anal or rectal &quot;tightness&quot; after the procedure. </p><p>Patients are placed in the semi-inverted jackknife or left lateral position. The procedure is performed through the anoscope, and small rubber band rings are placed onto the internal hemorrhoids traditionally using a forceps, but other methods have been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63288 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89835\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89835 \">picture 1</a>). When a forceps ligator is used to apply the bands, an assistant is required to stabilize the anoscope. Once the involved hemorrhoid is identified through an anoscope, the rubber ring ligating drum with two rubber rings is placed into the anal canal. The largest internal hemorrhoid should be treated first. The internal hemorrhoid is grasped with forceps, and the excess tissue is pulled toward the tip or drum of the handheld ligator gun apparatus while the trigger causes the release of the rubber band. The rubber rings are then advanced down to the neck of the hemorrhoid. The key technical point is to ensure the bands are placed at least 5 mm above the dentate line to avoid placement onto somatically innervated tissue. Severe pain will result from misapplication of the band below the dentate line or from associated spasm. Thus, prior to rubber band release, the patient should be questioned about the presence of pain, which may indicate the need to select a point more proximal in the anal canal. If a patient experiences intense or excruciating pain as the rubber band is placed, then the band should be removed immediately by cutting the rubber band. </p><p>Other application techniques have been described. Each uses the same principles as the traditional forceps approach described above.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic suction ligator &ndash; An alternative technique involves suction of the symptomatic hemorrhoid into the ligating drum, which is attached to an endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. The ring is deployed through a trigger passed through the biopsy channel of the endoscope. This approach may allow for adequate ligation with fewer treatment sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A single-handed nonendoscopic ligating device has also been used successfully and is less expensive than the endoscopic device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wall suction ligator &ndash; Another technique uses a vacuum suction band ligator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The application of the rubber band using wall suction can be performed in fewer sessions compared with the standard forceps technique (1.2 versus 2 sessions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The principles are the same, but the rubber band ligator is attached to wall suction. The operator places the drum with the rubber band against the hemorrhoid. Suction pulls the hemorrhoid into the drum and the rubber band is deployed. The technical advantage is that the operator can hold the ligator and apply the band with one hand and hold the anoscope with the other unassisted. </p><p/><p>Successful ligation results in thrombosis of the hemorrhoid and the development of localized submucosal scarring. The banded hemorrhoidal tissues immediately become ischemic and then necrotic in the next three to five days, forming an ulcerated tissue bed. Complete healing occurs several weeks later. </p><p>One of the largest series to describe long-term outcomes of rubber band ligation included 805 patients who underwent 2114 ligations (median of two ligations in each patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Excluding 104 patients who were lost to follow-up, treatment was considered successful in 71 percent (80 percent when considering patients who underwent repeated treatment after initial failure). Success rates were similar for all degrees of hemorrhoids. A higher failure rate was observed in patients who required placement of four or more bands. </p><p>In a meta-analysis of 18 trials, rubber band ligation was more effective than injection sclerotherapy or infrared coagulation for the treatment of grades I, II, and III hemorrhoids, requiring fewer treatment sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The risk of complications and pain tended to be greater for rubber band ligation when compared with other techniques. Compared with surgery, rubber band ligation had more recurrent symptoms but was associated with fewer complications and pain. </p><p>Following rubber band ligation, the most frequent complication is pain, which occurs in approximately 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/42,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,50-53</a>].

Bleeding can be significant in patients with coagulation abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhoidal thrombosis &ndash; Hemorrhoids distal to the treated hemorrhoid can thrombose, leading to pain or a palpable mass.

The most common solution used is phenol (5%) in vegetable oil, although other sclerosants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-morrhuate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium morrhuate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>, urea hydrochloride, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-tetradecyl-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium tetradecyl sulfate</a> (Sotradecol), and hypertonic saline have all been used. The sclerosant causes an intense inflammatory reaction, destroying redundant submucosal tissue associated with hemorrhoidal prolapse. </p><p>As with rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy does not require anesthesia (local or intravenous). Patients are placed in the semi-inverted jackknife or left lateral position, and the procedure is performed through the anoscope. The internal hemorrhoids targeted for treatment are located and injected with 1 to 3 cc of the sclerosant material into the submucosa plane using a long intravenous 21-gauge needle or a spinal needle. A wheal should be raised with the solution. If the injection is too superficial, the area will become tense and blanched, and the injection should stop immediately to minimize risk of mucosal necrosis.</p><p>This approach can be used to treat grades I and II bleeding internal hemorrhoids with reported success rates of 75 to 89 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], which has more recurrences than rubber band ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, it is especially beneficial to patients with an elevated bleeding risk (eg, those on anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs and those with portal hypertension) due to a lack of eschar formation and patients who are immunocompromised due to a lower risk of anorectal sepsis compared with rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H104856039\" class=\"local\">'Choice of office-based technique'</a> above.)</p><p>Complications of sclerotherapy are also uncommon, with the most frequent being minor discomfort or bleeding with the injection. Rectourethral fistulas, rectal perforations, and necrosing fasciitis are rare complications but can occur with misplaced injections into nonhemorrhoidal tissues or with systemic injections into the vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438682858\"><span class=\"h3\">Infrared coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infrared coagulation involves the direct application of infrared light waves to the hemorrhoidal tissues. Patients with grade I or II bleeding internal hemorrhoids are candidates for this procedure.</p><p>Infrared coagulation is sometimes erroneously referred to as laser therapy. Infrared light waves are converted into heat, which results in protein necrosis within the hemorrhoid. This is seen as a white, blanching effect to the mucosa approximately 3 mm wide by 3 mm deep. Over a period of one to two weeks, the white, discolored mucosa changes into a dark scab and eventually leads to a puckered or ablated area, causing retraction of the redundant hemorrhoid mucosa.</p><p>The patient is positioned in the semi-inverted jackknife or left lateral position, and anoscopy is performed. The tip of the infrared coagulation applicator or probe is applied to the base of the internal hemorrhoid for two seconds, with three to five applications per hemorrhoid. </p><p>Compared with rubber band ligation, infrared coagulation is associated with more recurrences but fewer complications and causes less discomfort immediately after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438685371\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other techniques involve the application of monopolar cautery (electrotherapy), bipolar diathermy (Bicap, HET bipolar system), laser photocoagulation, or cryosurgery to cause coagulation and necrosis, which leads to fibrosis in the submucosal layer.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage#H21562738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Management of ectopic varices'</a>.)</p><p>Hemorrhoidal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension is first treated conservatively. Patients who fail conservative management are usually treated with sclerotherapy. Rubber band ligation is contraindicated, again because of the risk for delayed bleeding. Patients who fail rubber band ligation require either suture ligation of the bleeding hemorrhoid or surgical hemorrhoidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2842957788\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient with inflammatory bowel disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, hemorrhoid surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease reportedly led to significant complications such as sepsis, stenosis, fistulas, fecal incontinence, nonhealing wounds, and even need for proctectomy. The complication rates were also substantially higher with Crohn disease than with ulcerative colitis.</p><p>Thus, most patients with inflammatory bowel disease who develop symptomatic hemorrhoids are managed conservatively with a high-fiber diet, oral hydration, warm sitz bath, and oral phlebotonics. Select patients with symptoms refractory to best medical therapy may be offered surgical treatment if their inflammatory bowel disease is under control, and such patients should be counselled regarding the high-risk nature of any intervention. </p><p>The optimal surgical treatment for this patient population is not known; most reports were based on small retrospective studies conducted many years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, surgeons often prefer conventional techniques such as hemorrhoidectomy, or minimally invasive techniques such as rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidal artery ligation, to hemorrhoidopexy due to the life-threatening complications associated with the latter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H837733007\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

(See <a href=\"#H813383083\" class=\"local\">'Conservative treatment for all patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with low-grade (I or II) internal hemorrhoids respond favorably to conservative treatment and do not require any further treatment. Reasons to refer patients to a specialist include refractory or complicated hemorrhoids for possible intervention and rectal bleeding for possible colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H962841373\" class=\"local\">'Reasons to refer to a specialist'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with grade I, II, or III internal hemorrhoids refractory to conservative treatment, we recommend an office-based procedure, rather than surgical hemorrhoidectomy, as the initial intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Compared with surgical treatment of hemorrhoids, most office-based procedures cause less pain and less complications. (See <a href=\"#H438685862\" class=\"local\">'Rubber band ligation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commonly performed office-based procedures include rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation of internal hemorrhoids. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For healthy patients with grade I, II, or III internal hemorrhoids, we recommend rubber band ligation rather another office-based procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Compared with sclerotherapy or infrared coagulation, rubber band ligation is more effective and requires fewer treatment sessions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rubber band ligation is contraindicated in patients who are on anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, are immunocompromised, or have portal hypertension. In these patients, we suggest sclerotherapy rather than infrared coagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Sclerotherapy is better studied in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H438682759\" class=\"local\">'Sclerotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with grade IV internal hemorrhoids, those with combined internal and external hemorrhoids and significant prolapse, and those with another indication for anorectal surgery should be offered surgical hemorrhoidectomy if they fail conservative treatment.
