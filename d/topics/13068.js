Clinical and histopathological distinctions between these conditions suggest that different pathogenic processes underlie each of the inflammatory myopathies. The most common of these disorders include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatomyositis (DM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overlap syndromes (with another systemic rheumatic disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inclusion body myositis (IBM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymyositis (PM)</p><p/><p>No specific environmental factors or infectious causes have known roles in these disorders.</p><p>Other subtypes of inflammatory myopathy include eosinophilic myositis and granulomatous myositis. Many patients with inflammatory myopathies cannot be assigned to any category and may be classified as having nonspecific myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The precise mechanisms leading to tissue injury in the inflammatory myopathies are poorly defined in most cases.</p><p>The pathogenesis of the inflammatory myopathies, including DM, IBM, PM, and necrotizing myopathy, is reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of the inflammatory myopathies, the pathogenesis of juvenile DM and PM, and overlap syndromes associated with systemic rheumatic diseases are discussed elsewhere.

One model, which the author favors, focuses on a central role for type 1 interferons (IFN) in causing capillary, myofiber, and keratinocyte injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. An alternative view centers on the hypothesis that DM myofiber injury results from an antibody and complement-mediated microangiopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. DM in some patients is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with cancer through unknown mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy in dermatomyositis and polymyositis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is well-established that DM muscle pathology is characterized by injury to both capillaries and myofibers. Perifascicular myofibers, located at the boundaries between fascicles and perimysial connective tissue, appear preferentially targeted. Central questions regarding the pathogenesis of DM are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through what mechanism are capillaries injured?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the relationship of the capillary injury to perimysial perifascicular myofiber injury?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206354349\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1 interferon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is substantial evidence that the induction of type 1 IFN-inducible gene products, both transcripts and proteins, is highly and specifically associated with DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/3,4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8</a>]. Serum levels of IFN-beta are highly correlated with DM skin clinical disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD4-positive cells &ndash; Inflammatory cells highly expressing the CD4 protein are abundant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although the nature of these CD4+ cells is not fully understood, many of these are plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53554\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53554 \">picture 1</a>), immune cells that are proficient at producing type 1 interferons (IFN-alpha and -beta, and possibly omega) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Such pDCs have been called &quot;natural interferon-producing cells&quot; because of their capacity to produce over 1000 times the amount of IFN-alpha than other cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 IFN-inducible proteins &ndash; Among patients with DM, the type 1 IFN-inducible protein, myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA), has been observed to be densely expressed on perifascicular myofibers and sometimes on all myofibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MxA expression in myofibers is specific to DM, and MxA is also overexpressed in the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. MxA detection in muscle is the most sensitive biomarker for DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-IFIH1 antibody &ndash; An antibody that recognizes the type 1 IFN-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (IFIH1, also called MDA-5) appears to exhibit good sensitivity and very high specificity for amyopathic DM. Among 262 patients in Japan with a range of connective tissue diseases, anti-IFIH1 antibodies demonstrated 69 percent sensitivity and over 99 percent specificity for amyopathic DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Significant anti-IFIH1 autoantibody levels were present in 22 of 32 patients with amyopathic DM but were present only in 1 of 35 patients with classic DM and in 0 of 53 patients with polymyositis (PM).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An association of anti-IFIH1 antibodies with amyopathic and clinically amyopathic DM (those without weakness but with some muscle enzyme elevation) was also seen in one series of 77 patients with DM in the US; however, the sensitivity and specificity for amyopathic disease were both lower than those in the Japanese study population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This antibody is thus a potential biomarker of amyopathic DM, although additional research is needed to establish how it relates to disease pathogenesis, and further study in other populations and in larger numbers of patients will be needed to determine its clinical utility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene expression profiling &ndash; Large-scale profiling, using microarrays, of mRNA transcripts abundant in inflammatory myopathy muscle has shown very high levels of both immunoglobulin transcripts and many transcripts that are known to be induced by type 1 IFN, IFN alpha and IFN beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/12,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19-21</a>]. Type 1 IFN-inducible transcripts are the single most upregulated pathway present in DM muscle, with approximately 90 percent of the highest differentially upregulated transcripts belonging within this class. The degree of upregulation of most of these transcripts is unique to DM among inflammatory myopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For example, the transcript for ISG15 (IFN-stimulated gene 15) was 570-fold higher, and MxA was 280-fold higher in DM than in normal muscle, compared with approximately fivefold higher levels compared with normal for each in PM and IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Upregulation of these type 1 IFN-inducible transcripts is also present in blood, but this finding is not unique to DM. Such upregulation is present in both DM and PM and correlates with disease activity in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubuloreticular inclusions &ndash; Tubuloreticular inclusions that are identical to what have been called &quot;lupus inclusions&quot; are biomarkers for type 1 interferon exposure; a variety of cultured cell types, including human endothelial cells, develop tubuloreticular inclusions in vitro when exposed to IFN-alpha or -beta but not to type 2 interferon gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. The finding of tubuloreticular inclusions in muscle capillaries is highly specific for DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]; such inclusions have been found, for example, in childhood DM in 76 to 98 percent of all intramuscular blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>Relying upon these and other observations, a model of the pathogenesis of DM resulting from the induction of type 1 IFN-inducible gene products can be constructed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54558\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54558 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. According to this model, type 1 IFN production by pDCs might occur through engagement of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and TLR-7, which ligate sequence-specific DNA or RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Autoantibodies bound to DNA or RNA in DM muscle may stimulate pDCs to secrete type 1 IFN, as is believed to occur in systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Injury to myofibers in DM may occur because of the inappropriate and sustained production of type 1 IFN-inducible transcripts or proteins within myofibers through unknown effects.</p><p>These markers of type 1 IFN activity, type 1 IFN-inducible gene transcripts and tubuloreticular inclusions, suggest disease driven by type 1 IFN. However, the detection of the transcripts encoding type 1 IFN themselves or the proteins IFN-alpha or -beta in DM muscle has not been impressive. The identity of factors driving the transcription of IFN-alpha or &ndash;beta-inducible genes in DM is, thus, unknown, and it is entirely possible, though speculative, that some molecules other than type 1 IFN are capable of inducing this pathway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18308436\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoantibodies with affinities for various antigens, such as the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, have been reported in DM and other inflammatory myopathies, including PM, necrotizing myopathy, and overlap syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. The pathogenic role of any of these antibodies is uncertain and continues to be explored, although the detection of these antibodies may be useful clinically because of their association with particular clinical syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults#H17269501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>Anti-Jo-1 (anti-histidyl tRNA synthetase), one of a number of antibodies commonly termed &quot;myositis-specific autoantibodies&quot; (MSA), exhibits relative, but not absolute, specificity for PM and DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Several series have documented a total of over 30 patients with anti-Jo-1 antibodies and interstitial lung disease but without myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In one study, a positive association was shown between anti-Jo-1 antibody levels and disease activity in patients with inflammatory myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The association was stronger in a small serial cohort than in the larger cross-sectional analysis, but a pathogenic role for the antibodies remains unproven. Evidence is also lacking for most of the antibodies that myositis-associated or -specific autoantibodies injure muscle. As an example, mouse models of myositis induced by immunization with histidyl tRNA synthetase are not dependent on the development of antibody responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and have been hypothesized to be mediated by innate immune mechanisms or by the action of histidyl tRNA synthetase as a chemokine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>It is possible that capillaries are first injured by an antibody-directed attack on an endothelial antigen, and perifascicular atrophy occurs as a consequence of a lack of blood supply to these particular myofibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, a pathogenic autoantibody to a specific endothelial antigen has not been identified.</p><p>Injury to endothelial cells could also begin by some other means, with activation of the complement cascade on the endothelial surface developing as a secondary phenomenon. In addition, perifascicular muscle fibers may be less rather than more vulnerable to ischemia than central muscle fibers, according to experimental models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. There is also a lack of evidence that such fibers are damaged by ischemia in DM, such as the presence of transcripts or proteins in these myofibers thought to be specifically induced by ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Notably, microvascular complement deposition is nearly absent in fascicles containing perifascicular atrophy and is limited instead to other fascicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18308464\"><span class=\"h1\">INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) exhibit distinctive clinical and pathological features, including inflammatory cells surrounding myofibers and rimmed vacuoles. However, the mechanisms of myofiber injury in IBM are poorly understood. Some myofibers appear to be injured by invading cytotoxic T cells, while others have no apparent cause for their morphological abnormalities and have been called degenerative. Several hypotheses have been developed to explain the pathophysiology of IBM, but no single well-supported theory explains all the features of this condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of inclusion body myositis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-inclusion-body-myositis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of inclusion body myositis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A group of inherited muscle disorders sometimes referred to as inclusion body myopathies or hereditary inclusion body myopathies (&quot;h-IBM&quot;) has only superficial resemblance to this disease and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of inclusion body myositis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28307279\"><span class=\"h2\">IBM disease mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several observations in patients have been of particular interest in the study of IBM disease mechanisms. Studies in animals have not provided information that can be readily generalized to human IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/44-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28307286\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of adaptive immune responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is abundant evidence for an important role of adaptive (antigen-driven) immune responses in IBM, including infiltrates of intramuscular CD4+ T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, myeloid dendritic cells, and plasma cells deep within fascicles, surrounding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64343 \">picture 2</a>) and displacing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77138\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77138 \">picture 3</a>) myofibers and sometimes invading them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55160\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55160 \">picture 4</a>). The following observations support this view:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clonally restricted maturation of intramuscular T and B cells is shown by antigen receptor sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/5,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,58,59</a>]. A genetic influence is suggested by findings of different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene alleles associated with IBM in different populations, including alleles seen in other autoimmune diseases, such as DRB1*0301 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evidence of an important role for antigen-driven antibody production comes from microarray studies of gene expression within muscle biopsy samples showing that the most abundant transcripts in IBM muscle were derived from immunoglobulin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/19,20,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,58</a>]. These plasma cells show evidence of antigen-driven affinity maturation and clonal expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of myeloid dendritic cells, which are potent antigen-presenting cells, was also predicted by microarray analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Myeloid dendritic cells in IBM and PM frequently surround and sometimes invade nonnecrotic muscle fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63868\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63868 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. They are also present within dense collections of inflammatory infiltrates displacing myofibers in their differentiated stellate morphology, suggesting that they may be locally activating T cells, a process generally occurring primarily in lymph nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targets of the adaptive immune response have been identified. An autoantibody directed against cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) has been detected in at least half of patients with IBM studied, and strong reactivity of the antibody had relatively high specificity for IBM, compared with other muscle diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. Blood testing for the presence of anti-cN1A antibodies may be useful in the diagnosis. The cN1A antigen reactivity was localized to areas of myonuclear degeneration, accumulating in perinuclear regions and rimmed vacuoles in IBM muscle. Another possible antigen, alpha-B crystallin, has also been identified in some patients with IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In IBM, some myofibers are visibly invaded by T cells, suggesting one mechanism of myofiber injury, although many myofibers are simply displaced by T cells without apparent invasion, and many other myofibers are morphologically abnormal without neighboring immune system cells. There is less frequent myofiber necrosis and more frequent invasion of nonnecrotic myofibers by mononuclear cells in IBM compared with polymyositis (PM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. One hypothesis to explain these findings is that soluble secreted molecules of the immune system play a role in IBM myofiber injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expansion of CD8+ and CD57+ T cells in blood and muscle is common in IBM and may result in an overlapping diagnosis of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10454645\"><span class=\"h3\">Myofiber abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several abnormalities of myofibers seen on routine microscopy or under electron microscopy are characteristic of IBM.

Such structures were hypothesized to arise from nuclear degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/70-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-74</a>]. The majority of rimmed vacuoles are lined with nuclear membrane proteins lamin <span class=\"nowrap\">A/C</span> and emerin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>] and with histone H1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], suggesting they frequently derive from myonuclear breakdown. Studies have found a nucleic acid-binding protein lining vacuoles of some IBM myofibers, while failing to confirm claims of specific beta-amyloid precursor protein transcript abundance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The discovery of the nucleic acid-binding protein TDP-43 in IBM non-nuclear sarcoplasm has advanced this line of inquiry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-79</a>].</p><p>Abnormalities in the distribution of TDP-43 in IBM myofibers with fluorescent microscopy are present in about one-quarter of IBM myofibers, most of which appear morphologically normal or only minimally abnormal on parallel hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62042\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62042 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Clinical and histopathological distinctions between these conditions suggest that different pathogenic processes underlie each of the inflammatory myopathies, but the precise mechanisms leading to tissue injury in the inflammatory myopathies are poorly defined. (See <a href=\"#H18308386\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise mechanisms responsible for DM are unknown, and several different models have been proposed. One model, which the author favors, focuses on a central role for type 1 interferons (IFN). An alternative view centers on the hypothesis that DM myofiber injury results from an antibody and complement-mediated microangiopathy. The pathogenic role of myositis-specific autoantibodies is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H18308393\" class=\"local\">'Dermatomyositis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H206354349\" class=\"local\">'Type 1 interferon'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18308436\" class=\"local\">'Autoantibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanisms of myofiber injury in IBM are poorly understood. Some myofibers appear to be injured by invading cytotoxic T cells, while others have no apparent cause for their morphological abnormalities and have been called degenerative. Several hypotheses have been developed to explain the pathophysiology of IBM, but no single well-supported theory explains all the features of this condition. The evidence for a role in IBM of an adaptive immune response is the strongest of all the inflammatory myopathies. One of the targets of this response is an antigen found in areas of myonuclear degeneration, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A), which is recognized by autoantibodies that are present in many patients with IBM. (See <a href=\"#H28307286\" class=\"local\">'Role of adaptive immune responses'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10454645\" class=\"local\">'Myofiber abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immune mechanisms involved in PM appear similar to those responsible for IBM, despite the greater clinical similarity of PM to DM. Challenges to understanding the pathogenesis of PM are the very heterogeneous nature of this group of patients and the lack of agreement on diagnostic criteria. However, in PM, unlike IBM, there is evidence of circulating autoantibodies and high expression in blood, but not in muscle, of type 1 IFN-inducible transcripts. In PM, by contrast with DM, the cellular infiltrate is predominantly within the fascicle, muscle fiber injury is diffuse, there are no signs of vasculopathy, and there is increased expression of class I major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens by muscle fibers. Myofiber injury appears to be mediated directly by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes that surround and invade myofibers.
