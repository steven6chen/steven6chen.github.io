It is an X-linked inborn error of the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway. This results in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and the deacylated derivative globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3) within lysosomes in a wide variety of cells, thereby leading to the protean manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fabry disease. The cardiac, neurologic, and renal manifestations, and the treatment of Fabry disease, are discussed elsewhere.

However, the disease is seen across all ethnic and racial groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of Fabry disease is probably underestimated given incomplete ascertainment. This is likely since [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The manifestations of the disease are nonspecific.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is often not considered by clinicians, given the rarity of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wrong diagnosis is often made initially. As an example, in the 366 European patients with Fabry disease participating in the Fabry Outcome Survey, the mean delay to correct diagnosis after symptom onset was estimated to be 13.7 and 16.3 years for males and females, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Large genetic screening programs, which do not rely upon the development of clinical symptoms, suggest that Fabry disease is more common than previously suspected. Mutations associated with classic manifestations of Fabry disease are present in approximately 1:22,000 to 1:40,000 males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and mutations associated with atypical, so called &quot;later-onset&quot;, presentations are present in approximately 1:1000 to 1:3000 males and 1:6000 to 1:40,000 females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1968006993\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic defect in Fabry disease is deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A), which catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal galactose from globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The threshold level of alpha-Gal A activity below which clinically significant Fabry disease occurs is thought to be 30 to 35 percent of the mean normal control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Males with the classic form of Fabry disease are &quot;null mutants&quot; with alpha-Gal A activity that is almost always less than 1 percent of the normal mean. Higher alpha-Gal A activity is most often present in females and those with atypical variants. There is a relationship, albeit imprecise, between enzyme activity and disease symptoms; enzyme activity is the primary predictor of the likelihood to develop Fabry-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1411197408\" class=\"local\">'Classic Fabry disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3246598100\" class=\"local\">'Heterozygous females'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1083724196\" class=\"local\">'Atypical (later-onset) variants'</a> below.)</p><p>Gb3 is an intermediate in the degradative pathway of globoside. Globoside, a major glycosphingolipid in the red cell membrane and the kidney, is composed of ceramide attached to three sugar residues and an N-acetylgalactosamine residue (ceramide-Glc-Gal-Gal-GalNAc). Globoside is metabolized in lysosomes, particularly in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. In the absence of significant alpha-Gal A activity, Gb3 accumulates in various cells and tissues. Tissue accumulation of Gb3 is inversely correlated with residual alpha-Gal A activity in leukocytes and many other cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The accumulation of Gb3 is particularly prominent in the vascular endothelium (at levels up to 460-fold higher than normal), vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>]. The deposition of glycosphingolipid in these cells may lead to death of smooth muscle cells, vascular occlusion, ischemia, and infarction.</p><p>Accumulation of Gb3 in autonomic ganglia; dorsal root ganglia; renal glomerular, tubular, and interstitial cells; cardiac muscle cells; vascular smooth muscle cells; valvular fibrocytes; and cardiac conduction fibers may lead to the myriad other manifestations of the disease. Accumulation in the cornea also occurs but is clinically silent. The actual clinical involvement varies significantly among different organs, which likely represents various rates of sphingolipid metabolism in different tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Gb3 deposition may be only partially responsible for the manifestations of the disease, and other as-yet unexplained factors might also contribute. In one report of 57 symptomatic female patients with confirmed Fabry genotype who underwent a skin biopsy, only one patient had visible glycolipid accumulation in endothelial cells by light microscopy, and 10 to 50 percent had mild accumulation in other cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, cardiac, renal, or cerebrovascular abnormalities were documented in 90 percent. Electron microscopy and examination of other organs such as kidney or heart were not done in this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1968006993\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fabry disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A; galactosidase alpha [<em>GLA</em>]) gene mapped to the long arm (Xq22.1 region) of the X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and is inherited as an X-linked disorder. This mode of inheritance leads to important clinical characteristics in affected families:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Males with Fabry disease are hemizygous and pass the Fabry genetic variant on to all of their daughters, who are heterozygotes, but none of their sons. In general, males are more severely affected than females. (See <a href=\"#H1411197408\" class=\"local\">'Classic Fabry disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Females with Fabry disease are heterozygous for the Fabry gene mutation and have a 50 percent chance of passing the gene on to daughters or sons. Female heterozygotes have a variable disease course that ranges from asymptomatic disease to a more severe phenotype that resembles that seen in males. This phenotypic variation may be due in large part to random X-chromosome inactivation, by which some cells will have the X chromosome with the defective gene activated and others will have the X chromosome with the functioning gene activated. Thus, the severity of symptoms and organ involvement depends upon which organs or tissues have the mutated gene activated in a significant majority of the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Most kindreds have specific, or private, mutations, and de novo mutations are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The severity of symptoms may vary among individuals depending upon the specific <em>GLA </em>mutation within their family. Efforts to establish genotype-phenotype correlations have been limited by the fact that most families have a private mutation, and phenotypic variation exists even among patients with the same mutation. In general, mutations that result in little to no alpha-Gal A activity cause the classic Fabry phenotype, and those that result in residual alpha-Gal A activity cause the atypical, &quot;later-onset&quot; phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, the interaction between alpha-Gal A deficiency and other genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors may also influence an individual's risk of Fabry disease complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Fabry disease may present with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from the severe classic phenotype in males to asymptomatic disease in some females, with a variety of clinical presentations in between. The age of symptom onset is more consistent in male hemizygotes than in female heterozygotes; approximately 80 percent of males have neurologic, dermatologic, and renal and cardiac manifestations by the second, third, and fifth decades of life, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Males with atypical variants may present even later in life, diagnosed during evaluations for cardiomegaly or proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1411197408\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic Fabry disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic form of Fabry disease is the most severe clinical phenotype and occurs predominantly in males, although some heterozygous females have a more severe phenotype that resembles classic Fabry disease in males. Males with classic Fabry disease have little or no functional alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) enzyme activity (&lt;1 percent of the normal mean). Although variability exists, the symptoms of Fabry disease tend to appear in a predictable order in classically affected males (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57531 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25,27</a>]. Clinical manifestations begin in childhood or adolescence and include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe neuropathic or limb pain (acroparesthesias), which may be precipitated by stress, extremes of heat or cold, and physical exertion. Neuropathic symptoms occur in more than 75 percent of patients with a mean age of onset of 10 years.

These symptoms appear to be caused by the deposition of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in autonomic ganglia of the bowel and mesenteric blood vessels, leading to intestinal dysmotility, impaired autonomic function, vasculopathy, and myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corneal opacities (cornea verticillata) are a characteristic feature seen relatively early on in almost all hemizygous males and most heterozygous females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. A formal slit-lamp examination is usually necessary to appreciate these corneal opacities. In addition, anterior and posterior subcapsular cataracts (the &quot;Fabry cataract&quot;) can be seen in approximately 30 percent of affected males. Other ocular findings include aneurysmal dilatation and tortuosity of conjunctival and retinal vessels. In general, the ocular manifestations of Fabry disease do not cause visual impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal manifestations such as proteinuria, isosthenuria, polyuria, and polydipsia or otherwise unexplained renal insufficiency are common. Renal disease, particularly proteinuria, occurs in more than 80 percent of untreated male patients with a mean age of diagnosis of 35 to 40 years. A more detailed discussion of the renal manifestations in Fabry disease is presented separately.

These manifestations occur in 50 to 70 percent of patients, often by the fourth decade. Hearing loss, which may be gradual or sudden in onset, is also common and is typically more frequent and severe in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>In adulthood, there may be progressive cardiac and cerebrovascular involvement, which accounts for the majority of deaths associated with Fabry disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac involvement includes concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, coronary artery disease, aortic and mitral valve abnormalities, and conduction abnormalities. Cardiac manifestations occur in more than 80 percent of male patients with classic Fabry disease, with a mean age of onset of 42 years. In some patients, these manifestations, particularly LVH, are the only recognized manifestations of the disease. Fabry disease is a potential cause of unexplained LVH or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmias are also common and potentially fatal manifestations of Fabry cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In addition, enlargement of large cranial arteries (dolichoectasia) may occur. Transient ischemic attacks and strokes occur in approximately 25 percent of patients with a mean age of onset of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Psychological manifestations, such as depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue, are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and can lead to suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Dysmorphic facial features including periorbital fullness, prominent lobules of the ears, thickening of the lips, and bulbous nose have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

However, studies have shown that clinical manifestations in heterozygous females can vary widely from no apparent clinical disease to full expression of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,29,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29,50-53</a>]. This phenotypic variation may be due, at least in part, to random X-chromosome inactivation, which results in a higher percentage of X chromosome with the disease mutation being expressed in affected organs. The onset of clinical manifestations in females roughly parallels that in males, but the prevalence of signs and symptoms at any given age is lower in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal disease typically present one decade or more later than in males. In a study of 1077 females enrolled in the Fabry Registry, approximately 70 percent reported symptoms or signs of Fabry disease; the median age of symptom onset was 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Most do not display the classical features of Fabry disease (see <a href=\"#H1411197408\" class=\"local\">'Classic Fabry disease'</a> above), and their disease is typically dominated by a particular organ system, most commonly the heart but also the kidney or central nervous system.

Consideration of Fabry disease as a possibility is the major hurdle to making the correct diagnosis in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6526096\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FAMILY MEMBERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In families known to have Fabry disease, we suggest the following approach in individuals at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At-risk or symptomatic male relatives of an affected individual &ndash; These males should be screened with an enzymatic assay (blood or leukocyte), even if asymptomatic. If deficient alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) activity is found, the individual should undergo comprehensive genetic analysis to identify the lesion, unless the mutation has been identified in the affected relative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At-risk female relatives of an affected individual, a female with a family history of Fabry disease, or a female with symptoms suggestive of Fabry disease &ndash; When testing women, sequencing the <em>GLA</em> gene is the diagnostic test of choice. Alpha-Gal A activity should <strong>not</strong> be used to diagnose females, given the high false-negative rate of alpha-Gal A testing among female carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,83</a>].</p><p/><p>Although available, routine prenatal screening is <strong>not</strong> recommended, as there are no data to suggest efficacy of initiating enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) during infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Prenatal testing involves measuring alpha-Gal A activity in fetal cells obtained through amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling; the latter allows earlier (9 versus 16 weeks) and faster test results (hours versus two weeks). However, a genetic mutation analysis must also be done because the sample may be contaminated with maternal tissue or female fetuses may have variable residual enzymatic activity.</p><p>Some have advocated screening by testing for elevated urinary excretion of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Mass spectrometry is one available method, with abnormally high levels being relative to healthy controls tested in the same lab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. However, urine Gb3 and globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3) may not always be elevated in heterozygotes or male patients with mild disease. In addition, urine Gb3 levels may be elevated in patients with common forms of heart disease who do not have Fabry disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,90</a>].

It is an X-linked inborn error of the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway. The metabolic defect in Fabry disease is deficiency or defect in the lysosomal hydrolase alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A), which catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal galactose from globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). This results in accumulation of Gb3 and the deacylated derivative globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3) within lysosomes in a wide variety of cells, producing the many manifestations of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fabry disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the alpha-Gal A (galactosidase alpha [<em>GLA</em>]) gene mapped to the long arm (Xq22.1 region) of the X chromosome and is inherited as an X-linked disorder. In general, hemizygous males are more severely affected than females. Female heterozygotes have a variable disease course that ranges from asymptomatic disease to a more severe phenotype that resembles that seen in males. This phenotypic variation is due in part to random X-chromosome inactivation. (See <a href=\"#H1968006993\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic form of Fabry disease is the most severe clinical phenotype and occurs predominantly in males. Clinical manifestations begin in childhood or adolescence and include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe neuropathic or limb pain (acroparesthesias), which may be precipitated by stress, extremes of heat or cold, and physical exertion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Telangiectasias and angiokeratomas, the latter commonly in groin, hip, and periumbilical areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F81624\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81624 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71039\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71039 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal pain, recurrent nausea and vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> either diarrhea or constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Corneal opacities (cornea verticillata)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proteinuria, isosthenuria, polyuria, and polydipsia or otherwise unexplained renal insufficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heat, cold, and exercise intolerance; hypohidrosis (or hyperhidrosis); and hearing loss, which may be gradual or sudden in onset</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In adulthood, there may be progressive cardiac and cerebrovascular involvement, which accounts for the majority of deaths associated with Fabry disease (see <a href=\"#H1411197408\" class=\"local\">'Classic Fabry disease'</a> above). Renal involvement may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterozygous females may exhibit any or all of the symptoms and signs of classic Fabry disease. With increasing age, females may develop cardiac involvement (such as left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH], arrhythmias, and valvular disease) and cerebrovascular disease (transient ischemic attacks and strokes). Renal manifestations, such as proteinuria, isosthenuria, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), occur less frequently. Cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal disease typically present one decade or more later than in males. (See <a href=\"#H3246598100\" class=\"local\">'Heterozygous females'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with atypical, &quot;later-onset&quot; variants of Fabry disease usually present later in life (third to seventh decades of life) than those with the classic form of the disease. They have residual alpha-Gal A activity and may not have Gb3 accumulation in capillaries and small blood vessels. Most do not display the classical features of Fabry disease, and their disease is typically primarily confined to a particular organ system, such as the heart, kidney, or central nervous system. The diagnosis is often made incidentally during an evaluation of unexplained LVH, heart failure, arrhythmias, proteinuria, renal failure, or cryptogenic stroke. (See <a href=\"#H1083724196\" class=\"local\">'Atypical (later-onset) variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An evaluation for Fabry disease should be performed in males or females with at least one of the following clinical features suggestive of the diagnosis, particularly (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intermittent episodes of burning pain in the extremities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cutaneous vascular lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diminished perspiration (hypo- or anhidrosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal pain, nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea of unknown etiology in young adulthood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>LVH of unknown etiology, particularly in young adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arrhythmias of unknown etiology, particularly in young adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stroke of unknown etiology at any age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CKD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria of unknown etiology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple renal sinus cysts discovered incidentally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial evaluation should consist of a detailed medical history and physical examination looking for suggestive clinical symptoms; a family history of unexplained neurologic, kidney, or cardiac disease transmitted in an X-linked pattern; angiokeratomas; telangiectasias; hypohidrosis; corneal opacities; and an abnormal cardiac exam. Laboratory studies should include a urinalysis looking for proteinuria, an assessment of renal function, and an electrocardiogram. Some clinicians obtain baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain as part of the initial evaluation, particularly in patients who present with neurologic manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of clearly established family history and classic phenotype, the diagnosis can usually be confirmed <strong>in males</strong> by a low alpha-Gal A activity in leukocytes (or plasma). Mutation analysis of the alpha-Gal A (<em>GLA</em>) gene is required to make the diagnosis <strong>in heterozygous females </strong>and in patients with atypical presentations or who have residual alpha-Gal A levels. The diagnosis of Fabry disease is typically established with a combination of biochemical and molecular genetic testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by family history, although incidental findings on renal or cardiac biopsies may also lead to the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6526122\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once diagnosed, patients with Fabry disease, or asymptomatic heterozygote females, should be followed closely using an interdisciplinary approach that involves routine care by nephrology, cardiology, and neurology, with input from dermatology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry as required. (See <a href=\"#H1760182612\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly considered initial diagnoses in patients with Fabry disease are rheumatologic conditions or rheumatic fever. Other often-considered diagnoses include arthritis, neuropsychological disease, fibromyalgia, dermatomyositis, erythromelalgia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Meniere disease, multiple sclerosis, irritable colon, idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and kidney failure of unknown etiology. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In families known to have Fabry disease, we suggest screening at-risk or symptomatic male relatives of an affected individual, at-risk female relatives of an affected individual, females with a family history of Fabry disease, and females with symptoms suggestive of Fabry disease. (See <a href=\"#H6526096\" class=\"local\">'Screening family members'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Germain DP.
