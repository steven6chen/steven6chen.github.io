However, the majority of women with inherited breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovarian cancers carry a deleterious mutation in one of two susceptibility genes, breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (<em>BRCA1</em>) or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (<em>BRCA2</em>). Less commonly, breast cancer is due to other hereditary syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni and Cowden syndromes, which are associated with mutations in the <em>TP53</em> and <em>PTEN</em> genes, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66808 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will present an overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes.

Mucocutaneous pigmented lesions occur in about 95 percent of affected patients; additionally, hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract are hallmark features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>This syndrome is associated with very elevated risks for gastrointestinal cancers, including cancers of the colon and rectum, stomach, small intestine, and pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, women with PJS have elevated risks for both breast and ovarian cancers, although ovarian cancers are often non-epithelial in origin. The absolute risk of breast cancer is approximately 55 percent and, in general, the diagnosis tends to occurs in younger women, with a mean age of 37 years (range, 9 to 48 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

In a prospective study of almost 3400 patients meeting relaxed International Cowden Consortium PHTS criteria, including 368 individuals with a deleterious mutation, the estimated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was 85.2 percent (95% CI 71.4-99.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Most cancers are diagnosed premenopausally between the ages of 38 and 46 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and in one study, 50 percent were impacted by age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is estimated that up to 67 percent of women with a <em>PTEN</em> mutation also have an increased risk of benign breast changes (eg, intraductal papillomatosis, adenosis, lobular atrophy, and fibroadenomas). However, benign breast findings are not included in the revised diagnostic criteria proposed in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Aside from breast cancer, women appear to have elevated risks for endometrial cancer and thyroid cancer, particularly follicular cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Further discussion of Cowden syndrome is covered separately.

Mutations in the two most common MMR genes, <em>MSH2 </em>and <em>MLH1,</em> confer a lifetime risk of colon cancer of 52 to 82 percent; endometrial cancer of 25 to 60 percent; and ovarian cancer of 4 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Some, but not all, studies have suggested that there is an increased risk of female breast cancer in mutation carriers of MMR genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/22,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,26</a>]. In a review of 21 studies, 13 found no statistical increase in breast cancer risk, eight reported an increased risk ranging from 2- to 18-fold compared with the general population, and one prospective study identified a fourfold increased risk for breast cancer (standardized incidence ratio 3.95, 95% CI 1.59-8.13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. There is also a suggestion that breast cancer risk may vary by gene mutation, but prospective studies are required to determine the precise estimates of breast cancer risk in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, the mean age of diagnosis of breast cancer in MMR gene carriers ranges from 44 to 65 years, and, therefore, screening measures should be individualized. </p><p>Interestingly, with the advent of multigene panel testing, a significant proportion of individuals with Lynch syndrome mutations do not meet diagnostic criteria for Lynch syndrome.

However, the exact risk of cancer associated with mutations in these genes is not clear. Commercial multigene panels include testing for the <em>BRCA </em>genes, the high-risk genes listed above, as well as mutations in several moderate-risk genes.

Less commonly, breast cancer is due to other hereditary syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni and Cowden syndromes, which are associated with mutations in the <em>TP53</em> and <em>PTEN</em> genes, respectively.

Many of these high-risk syndromes have characteristic presentations, although more widespread use of multigene panel testing has shown that there can be significant variability, and not all individuals who test positive meet established diagnostic criteria for these other syndromes.
