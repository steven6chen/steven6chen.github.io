Endometrial cancer is often classified into two subtypes (type I and type II), which reflect general characteristics of its clinicopathological spectrum. Type II neoplasms are generally associated with more aggressive clinical behavior than type I tumors. While they comprise 10 to 20 percent of endometrial carcinomas, they account for 40 percent of deaths from the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Information specific to type II endometrial carcinomas is reviewed here.

These tumors typically have a favorable prognosis, are estrogen-responsive, and may be preceded by an intraepithelial neoplasm (atypical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complex endometrial hyperplasia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II tumors account for 10 to 20 percent of endometrial carcinomas. They include grade 3 endometrioid tumors as well as tumors of nonendometrioid histology: serous, clear cell, mucinous, squamous, transitional cell, mesonephric, and undifferentiated. These tumors are often high grade, have a poor prognosis, and are not clearly associated with estrogen stimulation. A precursor lesion is rarely identified. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962297\"><span class=\"h2\">Precursor lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that uterine serous carcinoma (USC) develops from &quot;endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma&quot; (EIC), a lesion related to malignant transformation of the endometrial surface epithelium (such as a benign endometrial polyp), against a background of endometrial atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, EIC has been found in association with extrauterine serous carcinoma, with both sites having identical clones of <em>p53 </em>mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This finding has led some to suggest that EIC represents an early form of USC rather than its true precursor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A relatively new entity, &quot;endometrial glandular dysplasia,&quot; which histologically bridges benign endometrium and EIC, may be the putative precursor lesion to USC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].<br/><br/>A putative precursor lesion for endometrial clear cell carcinoma characterized by nuclear atypia has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962304\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most endometrioid cancers are well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinomas, which are characterized by proliferation of back-to-back endometrial glands without intervening stroma. By contrast, USC has a complex papillary architecture that resembles serous carcinoma of the ovary; psammoma bodies are present in 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Marked nuclear atypia is always present, and all USC is considered high grade.<br/><br/>Clear cell cancers are characterized by tubulocystic, papillary, or solid patterns; psammoma bodies are present in up to 10 percent of cases, most often in the papillary variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The cells may be clear because of the presence of glycogen. Myometrial invasion occurs in about 80 percent of cases. At least from the standpoint of gene expression, they appear more similar to clear cell cancers arising in other organs (eg, the kidney) than to other uterine cancers, including those of the serous variety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nevertheless, they are treated similar to serous cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>USC and clear cell carcinomas may be a component of mixed-histology tumors that have endometrioid or sarcomatous elements. If 10 percent or more of the tumor has a serous component, it is classified as USC; cases in which the serous component consists of more than 10 percent but less than 90 percent of the cancer are classified as mixed serous cancers.</p><p>Earlier studies suggested little difference in survival when patients with pure USC cancers were compared to those with mixed USC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. However, a multi-institutional series comparing 58 patients with mixed USC with 50 patients with pure uterine papillary serous carcinomas found the two most important prognostic factors for progression-free and overall survival were stage and pure USC histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients with pure USC histology had a 2.9-fold greater risk for recurrence and a 2.6-fold higher risk of death compared with those with mixed USC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].<br/><br/>For clear cell carcinomas, some pathologists require &ge;50 percent clear cell features to classify a tumor as a clear cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], while others use the benchmark of at least 25 percent clear cell component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Patients with pure clear cell cancers and mixed clear cell cancers with endometrioid components have the same survival as those whose clear cell cancers contain less histologically favorable components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962442\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both USC and clear cell tumors have a higher propensity for lymphovascular invasion, and intraperitoneal as well as extraabdominal spread, than endometrioid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/10,17,20,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,20,23-26</a>]. At the time of presentation, approximately 60 to 70 percent of women with USC will have disease spread outside of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25</a>].<br/><br/>Lymph node metastasis and extrauterine disease spread are extremely rare with endometrioid cancers that are noninvasive; by contrast, they frequently occur with noninvasive USC (ie, EIC). Furthermore, while tumor grade and depth of myometrial invasion are not predictive of extrauterine spread for USC, the incidence of extrauterine spread in endometrioid cancer correlates with both tumor grade and depth of myometrial invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58580\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58580 \">table 1</a>).<br/><br/>In one study, lymph node metastases were found in 36 percent of women with USC and no myometrial invasion, compared with 50 and 46 percent of those with inner one-half and outer one-half invasion, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The corresponding rates of intraperitoneal disease for these three groups were 43, 37, and 35 percent, respectively. Even having as little as 10 percent of the tumor composed of USC places the patient at the same risk for metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962449\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type I and type II uterine tumors also appear to have a different pattern of molecular alterations that underlie pathogenesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Alterations in the tumor suppressor gene <em>PTEN</em>, microsatellite instability, and K-ras alterations have been associated with the early development of type I tumors, while these alterations are uncommon in type II cancers. On the other hand, <em>p53</em> mutations appear to be important in the early pathogenesis of USC. Moreover, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) <span class=\"nowrap\">overexpression/amplification</span> has been associated with type II tumors. Whole exome sequencing of 76 USC specimens revealed somatic mutations in <em>TP53</em> (81.6 percent), <em>PIK3CA</em> (23.7 percent), <em>FBXW7</em> (19.7 percent), and <em>PPP2R1A</em> (18.4 percent), and DNA copy number analysis identified amplification of <em>CCNE1</em> as the most common genetic alteration in USC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-type-ii-histology-eg-serous-clear-cell-mucinous/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Inheritance of these mutations is more common in Jewish women, particularly those of Ashkenazi descent.

There are two histologic categories of endometrial carcinoma: type I (endometrioid grade 1 and 2) and type II (eg, endometrioid grade 3, serous, clear cell). (See <a href=\"#H4548929\" class=\"local\">'Histology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II neoplasms are generally associated with more aggressive clinical behavior than type I tumors. Approximately 70 percent of patients with uterine serous carcinoma (USC) and 50 percent with clear cell cancers present with stage III or IV disease. While they comprise 10 to 20 percent of endometrial carcinomas, type II tumors account for 40 percent of deaths from the disease. (See <a href=\"#H1962442\" class=\"local\">'Biologic behavior'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with type II endometrial carcinoma have different characteristics than those with endometrioid tumors. They tend to be older at diagnosis, nonobese, and parous. A personal history of breast cancer appears to be a risk factor for USC. (See <a href=\"#H4548904\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial carcinoma is a histologic diagnosis made based upon histologic evaluation of endometrial sampling, curettage, or a hysterectomy specimen. (See <a href=\"#H2028622\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II endometrial carcinomas are surgically staged in the same manner as type I tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113543 \">table 2</a>). Surgical staging is recommended for all type II tumors because of the high risk of nodal and extrauterine metastasis. Optimal cytoreduction is an important component of surgical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Staging and surgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overexpression or amplification of HER2 (erbB-2, the epidermal growth factor type II receptor) has been identified in a number of studies as a poor prognostic sign for type II endometrial carcinomas.
