SDH in children differs significantly from SDH in adults because abusive head injury is a common etiology, especially in pediatric patients &lt;2 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast to epidural hematoma (EDH), indications for operative management of SDH are less clear, and surgery is less likely to prevent morbidity and mortality.

This approach contrasts sharply with management of epidural hematoma in children where urgent surgery is always indicated in the presence of significant neurologic compromise.</p><p>The decision to perform surgery on children with SDH is based upon physical findings and the results of neuroimaging. No clear criteria for operative care exist and no controlled studies of operative approach in children have been performed. Due to the flexibility of the pediatric skull, the indications for surgery might occasionally differ from that of adults, but must be decided on a case by case basis by a neurosurgeon with pediatric expertise.

Depending on the size and location of the SDH, the timing (acute or chronic), and the presence of other brain abnormality on head CT, immediate surgery is not likely to improve outcome in some children. Therefore, some children with severe brain injury may not be surgical candidates despite the presence of subdural hematoma.
