Patients with ankle sprains (stretching, partial rupture, or complete rupture of at least one ligament) constitute a large percentage of these injuries.</p><p>Ankle ligaments provide mechanical stability, proprioceptive information, and directed motion for the joint. Recurrent ankle sprains can lead to functional instability and loss of normal ankle kinematics and proprioception, which can result in recurrent injury, chronic instability, early degenerative bony changes, and chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Acute ankle sprains can result in lost days of work and inability to participate in sports.</p><p>Ankle sprains will be reviewed here. Ankle fractures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF ANKLE SPRAINS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of injury generally determines the location of the sprain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86925 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral ankle sprain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common mechanism of ankle injury is inversion of the plantar-flexed foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60173\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173 \">figure 2</a>), which causes damage to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle. This ligament complex consists of the anterior talofibular ligament, the calcaneofibular ligament, and the posterior talofibular ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72462\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462 \">figure 3</a>). The ligaments within this complex are injured in a predictable sequence as forces increase.</p><p>The anterior talofibular ligament is the first or only ligament to be injured in the majority of ankle sprains. Stronger forces lead to combined ruptures of the anterior talofibular ligament and the calcaneofibular ligament, which can result in significant ankle joint instability. Isolated injury of the calcaneofibular ligament is uncommon. Yet stronger forces result in injury to all three ligaments. Such injuries, while uncommon, are more debilitating and more commonly associated with significant nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Medial ankle sprain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medial deltoid ligament complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952 \">figure 4</a>) is the strongest of the ankle ligaments and is infrequently injured. Forced eversion of the ankle can cause damage to this structure but more commonly results in an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus because of the strength of the deltoid ligament.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Syndesmotic sprain (high ankle sprain)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dorsiflexion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eversion of the ankle may cause sprain of the syndesmotic structures, which include the anterior tibiofibular, posterior tibiofibular, and transverse tibiofibular ligaments, and the interosseous membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61181\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61181 \">figure 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These structures are critical to ankle stability. Syndesmotic ligament injuries contribute to chronic ankle instability and are more likely to result in recurrent ankle sprain and the formation of heterotopic ossification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Syndesmosis sprains range from 1 to 11 percent of all ankle sprains, with a higher rate of injury occurring in contact sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Syndesmotic ankle is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndesmotic ankle injury (high ankle sprain)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ankle sprains have traditionally been classified based upon clinical signs and functional loss from grade I to grade III:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A grade I sprain results from mild stretching of a ligament with microscopic tears. Patients have mild swelling and tenderness. There is no joint instability on examination, and the patient is able to bear weight and ambulate with minimal pain. Due to their benign nature, these injuries are not frequently seen in the office.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A grade II sprain is a more severe injury involving an incomplete tear of a ligament. Patients have moderate pain, swelling, tenderness, and ecchymosis. There is mild to moderate joint instability on exam with some restriction of the range of motion and loss of function. Weightbearing and ambulation are painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A grade III sprain involves a complete tear of a ligament. Patients have severe pain, swelling, tenderness, and ecchymosis. There is significant mechanical instability on exam and significant loss of function and motion. Patients are unable to bear weight or ambulate.</p><p/><p>Although higher grade sprains involve more severe injuries to ligaments, the time for healing is not always proportional to the grade of the sprain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of an injured ankle requires a careful history. It is important to determine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism of injury in order to direct the rest of the examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86925 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not the patient could walk after the injury in order to help stratify risk of fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not the ankle had been previously injured, as people who sprain ankles are more likely to reinjure the same ankle; a study in basketball players found repeat ankle injuries almost five times as likely as primary injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination of the ankle includes inspection, palpation, determination of weightbearing ability, and injury-specific physical diagnostic tests.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look for swelling and ecchymosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpate the entire fibula (a syndesmotic injury may be associated with a fracture of the proximal fibula &mdash; a Maisonneuve fracture), the distal tibia, the foot, and the Achilles tendon. The Thompson test should be performed if any tenderness or a tissue deficit is detected while palpating the Achilles tendon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-achilles-ankle-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Check for tenderness in the areas required for the Ottawa ankle rules (posterior edge or tip of the lateral malleolus; posterior edge or tip of the medial malleolus; base of the fifth metatarsal; navicular bone). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Ottawa ankle rules'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Tenderness of the distal tibia or fibula may represent fracture associated with inversion or eversion injuries (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Ottawa ankle rules'</a> below). Tenderness over the ligamentous structures is a non-specific finding but often indicates injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An eversion or hyperdorsiflexion injury associated with tenderness at the distal tibiofibular joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66111\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66111 \">picture 1</a>) without significant swelling may suggest a syndesmosis sprain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Effusion and pain on palpation of the talocrural joint line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58683\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58683 \">picture 2</a>) may suggest a fracture of the osteochondral talar dome resulting from direct trauma between the talus and the fibula or tibia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check for pain on gentle passive inversion and eversion of the ankle. In lateral ankle sprains, pain is increased with forced ankle inversion, while the pain of a medial (deltoid) ligament sprain is accentuated by eversion of the ankle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform specific examination maneuvers (described below) including the squeeze test, the external rotation stress test, the anterior drawer test, and the talar tilt test. Although these maneuvers can be helpful, they have not been rigorously studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is no swelling or ecchymosis, physical examination maneuvers do not elicit pain, and the Ottawa ankle criteria for imaging are not met (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Ottawa ankle rules'</a> below), there is unlikely to be structural damage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8653137\"><span class=\"h2\">Special tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Squeeze test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The squeeze test consists of compression of the fibula against the tibia at the mid-calf level. This maneuver elicits pain in the region of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (anterior to the lateral malleolus and proximal to the ankle joint) when a syndesmotic sprain has occurred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102841 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">External rotation stress test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external rotation stress test can also help identify a syndesmotic sprain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57674\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57674 \">picture 4</a>). The clinician stabilizes the leg proximal to the ankle joint while grasping the plantar aspect of the foot and rotating the foot externally relative to the tibia. The test is positive if pain is elicited in the region of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (anterior to the lateral malleolus and proximal to the ankle joint).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior drawer test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior drawer test detects excessive anterior displacement of the talus on the tibia. If the anterior talofibular lateral ligament is torn by an inversion stress, the talus will sublux anteriorly and laterally out of the mortise. The test is performed with the patient's foot in the neutral position (slightly plantar flexed and inverted). The lower leg is stabilized by the examiner with one hand, and with the opposite hand, the examiner grasps the heel while the patient's foot rests on the anterior aspect of the examiner's arm. An anterior force is gently but steadily applied to the heel while holding the distal anterior leg fixed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58891 \">picture 5</a>). The amount of movement should be compared with the uninjured side to determine joint laxity. This test has limited usefulness in the acute setting because pain, swelling, and muscle spasm may limit mobility of the joint and interfere with the test's reliability. It is a more helpful test in the evaluation of chronic ankle instability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Talar tilt test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The talar tilt test detects excessive ankle inversion. If the ligamentous tear extends posteriorly into the calcaneofibular portion of the lateral ligament, the lateral ankle is unstable and talar tilt occurs. With the ankle in the neutral position, gentle inversion force is applied to the affected ankle, and the degree of inversion is observed and compared with the uninjured side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51938\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51938 \">picture 6</a>). As with the anterior drawer test, this maneuver is of limited usefulness in the acute injury when pain, swelling, and muscle spasm are present, and it may be more important in evaluating chronic ankle instability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Deferred examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deferred examination may improve the diagnosis of ligamentous injuries and instability. One study of 160 consecutive patients with inversion injuries found that performing a physical examination five days after the injury improved the accuracy of diagnosing ligament rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The positive predictive value for ligament rupture of the triad of pain on palpation of the anterior talofibular ligament, lateral discoloration due to hematoma, and a positive anterior drawer sign was 95 percent.</p><p>Despite this, most patients with acute ankle injuries can be appropriately managed and triaged without performing a deferred examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malleolar fractures, distal fibula fractures, talar dome fractures, and syndesmosis separation may be diagnosed with plain radiograph. If indicated, anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise radiographs should be obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86799\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86799 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Stress radiography (obtaining plain films while performing a talar tilt or anterior drawer stress maneuver) is sometimes considered; however, it is rarely if ever clinically helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In the setting of acute injury, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has no advantage over plain radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, MRI should be considered in ankle sprains that are still painful after six to eight weeks of standard therapy. MRI can detect talar dome fractures and may be used to confirm suspected syndesmosis injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While not well studied in the primary care setting, it is estimated that fracture of the ankle or midfoot occurs in less than 15 percent of patients presenting to an emergency department with an acute ankle sprain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. The Ottawa ankle rules were developed in an effort to reduce the number of unnecessary radiographs in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. How to determine whether imaging studies are needed in children and the use of clinical decision rules in such a setting are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-fractures-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical decision rules for ankle radiography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Ottawa ankle rules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Ottawa ankle rules were developed, tested, and validated in adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute ankle injuries. Although their use specifically in the primary care setting has not been assessed, the rules have demonstrated excellent results in both pediatric and adult emergency department patient populations.</p><p>A systematic review of 27 studies including 15,581 patients found that the Ottawa ankle rules were highly sensitive (96.4 to 99.6 percent) for excluding ankle fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Specificity was modest and varied widely (10 to 79 percent), but the rules were purposely calibrated for high sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Less than 2 percent of patients who were negative for fracture according to the rules actually had a fracture. Subsequent reviews have confirmed the high sensitivity and variable specificity of these rules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It has been estimated that use of these rules in the emergency department for patients presenting with an acute ankle sprain would reduce the number of unnecessary radiographs by 30 to 40 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Foot and ankle pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should remember that although multiple systematic reviews have found the Ottawa ankle rules to perform extremely well, as with any guidelines there are specific circumstances when clinical judgement should supersede them. As an example, patients with diminished peripheral sensation, such as diabetics, or intoxicated patients may need radiographs regardless of the Ottawa criteria. Missed fractures are a significant cause for litigation in the United States. The use of decision rules with children is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-fractures-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical decision rules for ankle radiography'</a>.)</p><p>The Ottawa ankle rules are as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69818\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69818 \">figure 6</a>):</p><p>An ankle series is only indicated for patients who have pain in the malleolar zone <strong>AND</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have bone tenderness at the posterior edge or tip of the lateral or medial malleolus</p><p/><p><strong>OR</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are unable to bear weight both immediately after the injury and for four steps in the emergency department or doctor's office.</p><p/><p>A foot series is only indicated for patients who have pain in the midfoot zone <strong>AND</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have bone tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal or at the navicular</p><p/><p><strong>OR</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are unable to bear weight both immediately after the injury and for four steps in the emergency department or doctor's office.</p><p/><p>The following apply to the use of the Ottawa ankle rules:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient can transfer weight twice to each foot (four steps), he or she is considered able to bear weight even if he or she limps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpate the distal 6 cm of the posterior edge of the fibula when assessing for bone tenderness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All lateral ankle ligament sprains can be treated in a similar fashion. Initial management goals are to limit inflammation and swelling and to maintain range of motion. Early treatment includes RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) for the first two to three days:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest is achieved by limiting weightbearing; patients use crutches until they are able to walk with a normal gait.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryotherapy applied as ice or cold water immersion is recommended for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours for the first 48 hours or until swelling is improved, whichever comes first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression with an elastic bandage to minimize swelling should be applied early.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The injured ankle should be kept elevated above the level of the heart to further alleviate swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used; no particular NSAID has been shown to be superior. Both oral and topical NSAIDs are more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. There are no studies comparing topical NSAIDs and oral NSAIDs, nor are there studies comparing NSAIDs with non-NSAID analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>), so it is not clear that an antiinflammatory effect is important. </p><p/><p>Exercises including plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, and foot circles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68033\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68033 \">figure 7</a>) should be started early, once acute pain and swelling subside, to maintain range of motion. The intensity of rehabilitation is increased gradually. Ankle splints or braces can limit extremes of joint motion and allow early weightbearing while protecting against reinjury. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Rehabilitation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Splints and braces'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of severe (grade III) ankle sprains is controversial. A brief period of immobilization may be helpful in some instances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mild (grade 1) ankle sprains do not require immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Treatment with an elastic wrap for a few days following the injury is sufficient. Patients with moderate (grade II) sprains may need sustained support following their injury. The combination of an elastic wrap and an Aircast or similar splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57089 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78043\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78043 \">picture 8</a>) for up to a few weeks is generally sufficient. Ankle support in patients with mild or moderate sprains should not interfere with early rehabilitation. The appropriate type and duration of immobilization in patients with severe ankle sprains remains unclear and is discussed further below.</p><p>Three systematic reviews have reported that functional rehabilitation of ankle sprains yields superior results for a number of clinically important outcomes compared to immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, the studies included in these reviews are limited by their low quality (problems include: small numbers, incomplete descriptions of interventions, inconsistent outcome measures, heterogeneity of functional treatments and immobilization techniques), and the Cochrane review on this subject has since been withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a separate analysis of the higher quality trials, the only significant result was that patients treated with functional rehabilitation returned to work sooner than those treated with immobilization (12.9 days, 95% CI 7.1-18.7). Although these systematic reviews must be interpreted cautiously, the results suggest improved outcomes using functional rehabilitation. It is notable that immobilization was not significantly favored in any of the analyses.</p><p>The treatment of severe (grade III) ankle sprains remains controversial. Data from the systematic reviews described above suggest that early mobilization with a stabilizing orthosis may result in earlier resumption of work and sports, compared with immobilization. However, a well-designed, multicenter, randomized trial of severe ankle sprains performed after the systematic reviews reported a different conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this study, 584 patients with severe ankle sprains were assigned to treatment using a below-knee cast for 10 days, Aircast brace, Bledsoe immobilization boot, or tubular compression bandage. Assessment at three months using a validated score for ankle function, found the greatest improvements in the cast group. Few if any patients received functional rehabilitation and the authors note that compliance with treatments other than casting could not be monitored. Follow-up at nine months revealed no significant differences in outcome or complications among the treatment groups. Of note, the most common reason for refusing to participate in the study was an unwillingness to be treated with a cast. </p><p>Given these results, it is difficult to determine the appropriate role and timing for immobilization and early functional rehabilitation in patients with grade III ankle sprains. It appears reasonable, particularly if mobilization is painful and compliance likely to be difficult, to offer a short period (10 days) of immobilization in a cast for patients with severe ankle sprains. Alternatively, a comparable period of strict nonweightbearing and immobilization using a combination of an Aircast splint and an elastic wrap (eg, ACE bandage) may be used. Early functional rehabilitation can be started once immobilization is discontinued. For patients treated without casting, the importance of compliance with the treatment plan (eg, maintaining nonweightbearing status and immobilization for the designated period) should be emphasized. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Rehabilitation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach and exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional rehabilitation is important in aiding the return to activity and preventing chronic instability and recurrent injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Early functional rehabilitation begins with exercises for mobility (Achilles tendon stretch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65646 \">picture 9</a>), foot circles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68033\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68033 \">figure 7</a>), alphabet exercises [have the patient trace letters in the air with his big toe]) and strength (isometric and isotonic plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, eversion, toe curls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55497 \">picture 10</a>) and marble pickups, heel walks and toe walks), and proceeds to exercises for proprioception (circular wobble board (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F111991\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111991 \">picture 11</a>) and walking on different and unstable surfaces) and activity-specific training (progressing from walk-jog, to jog-run, to run, to run with change of direction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p>In most patients with mild or moderate ankle sprains, functional rehabilitation should begin as soon the initial pain and swelling have subsided sufficiently to allow the patient to perform simple exercises. A randomized controlled study of patients with acute grade I and II ankle sprains, showed that patients who started therapeutic exercises within the first week of injury were engaging in weightbearing activities earlier without differences in pain, swelling or rate of reinjury compared to those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Rehabilitation continues until the patient has returned to pain-free, full activity.</p><p>The rehabilitation program should take several weeks in order for the ankle to strengthen and to limit the chance of reinjury. In a study of active-duty marines with grade II ankle sprains, those undergoing a structured rehabilitation program returned to duty up to several months earlier than those without rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Whether regular, supervised physical therapy is beneficial for all patients is unclear. A systematic review of four studies comparing home exercise programs with supervised physical therapy found that supervised rehabilitation resulted in less pain and subjective instability at intermediate follow-up (eight weeks after injury) but no difference at longer follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A subsequent large and well-conducted randomized trial involving 503 participants with grade I and II acute ankle sprains compared usual care (written instructions about protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities) with usual care plus supervised physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This study found no improved outcome, functional or subjective, with the addition of supervised physical therapy in the short term (one and three months) as well as at six months. Although the equivocal long-term benefits of supervised physical therapy reported in these studies raise questions about whether such treatment is needed for all patients,&nbsp;supervised rehabilitation may be advantageous for patients for whom a faster return to work or sport is especially important. If supervised rehabilitation is not feasible for a patient, a home exercise program is highly recommended.</p><p>According to a systematic overview of available systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there is strong evidence that exercise therapy following an acute ankle sprain reduces the risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. All three systematic reviews assessed in the overview study that examined the relationship between rehabilitation using exercise therapy and ankle sprain recurrence as a primary outcome reported that exercise therapy reduced the rate of repeat ankle injury.</p><p>Whether patients with severe sprains should have their ankle immobilized for a period of time prior to rehabilitation is controversial. Some patients may benefit from additional support. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Immobilization'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Splints and braces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During functional rehabilitation, it may be of benefit to use splints, braces, elastic bandages, or taping to try to reduce instability, protect the ankle from further injury, and to limit swelling. It remains unclear whether taping improves proprioception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of studies looking at the treatment of acute ankle sprains reported the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lace-up ankle supports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87055 \">picture 12</a>) were superior to semi-rigid ankle supports, elastic bandages, and tape in preventing persistent swelling. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semi-rigid ankle supports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78043\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78043 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71638\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71638 \">table 1</a>) resulted in a quicker return to work and to sports, and less instability at short-term follow-up, than elastic bandages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100199 \">picture 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100198\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100198 \">picture 14</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100200\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100200 \">picture 15</a>) caused more skin irritation than elastic bandages.</p><p/><p>The results of a small, limited randomized trial comparing rehabilitation of ankle sprain using a semi-rigid support brace, neuromuscular training, or a combination of bracing and neuromuscular training suggest that using an elastic semi-rigid support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96838\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96838 \">picture 16</a>) during sports activity decreases injury recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical repair of ruptured ankle ligaments is sometimes considered in patients with ankle sprains. A metaanalysis that looked at controlled trials of surgery for acute ruptures of lateral ankle ligaments found that compared with functional treatment, patients treated with surgery were significantly less likely to experience giving-way of the ankle (relative risk [RR] 0.23, 95% CI 0.17-0.31) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A subsequent systematic review concluded that there were methodologic flaws in all trials making it impossible to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for sprains of the lateral ankle ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>A subsequent prospective trial of therapy for lateral ankle ligament rupture allocated 185 patients to surgery and 203 patients to functional treatment based upon the week in which they presented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. After a median follow-up of eight years, fewer patients treated surgically than with functional treatment reported residual pain (16 versus 25 percent), symptoms of giving-way (20 versus 32 percent), and recurrent sprains (22 versus 34 percent). There was no difference in the percent of patients with worsening radiographic evidence of joint degeneration. At follow-up, patients treated surgically were less likely to have a positive anterior drawer test (30 versus 54 percent); however, this was assessed by clinicians who knew how the patients had been treated. Thus, there were no blinded objective assessments in this trial that demonstrated superiority of surgery.</p><p>Based on these results, it is unclear whether patients with acute ankle sprains would benefit from surgery. Given costs and operative risks, it is unlikely that most patients with mild or moderate ankle sprains will be treated surgically. It may be reasonable to consider surgery in some patients with severe sprains who are engaged in professional sports or other activities that are likely to impose repeated large stresses on the ankle joint.</p><p>Although many experts conclude that delayed operative reconstruction of injured ligaments achieves results similar to that with acute repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], we are not aware of any head-to-head trials that examine this issue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound and other proposed therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to a systematic review of six trials including 606 patients, ultrasound therapy is <strong>not</strong> an effective treatment for acute ankle sprain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Other therapies that do <strong>not</strong> appear to be effective include low-level laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], hyperbaric oxygen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], and platelet rich therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530767445\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic ankle instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ankle sprains recover fully with non-operative treatment, but as many as 30 percent of patients develop some chronic ankle instability, which can present as recurrent ankle sprain, giving way of the ankle without a new sprain, sensation that the ankle is unstable, avoiding or modifying usual daily or sporting activities, and recurrent ankle pain or swelling after six months. Predicting which patients who sustain an ankle sprain will develop instability is difficult. In a cohort study of patients with ankle injury found no correlation between the severity of the initial sprain and residual disability at seven year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>We think it is reasonable to recommend proprioceptive training as part of the treatment for patients with chronic ankle instability. A systematic review of seven trials involving 3726 participants reported that proprioceptive training is effective at reducing the rate of ankle sprains in sporting participants, particularly those with a history of ankle sprain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Other small randomized trials and observational evidence suggest that strength and balance exercises can improve ankle strength, range of motion, and perceived ankle stability compared to a wait-and-see approach or usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].

Risk is reduced by approximately 70 percent in this patient group (relative risk [RR] ranged from 0.15 to 0.5 among trials). Subsequently, two randomized non-blinded trials reported that use of a lace-up ankle brace reduced the frequency, but not the severity, of ankle injuries in high school football and basketball players regardless of whether the athlete had sustained an ankle sprain previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-sprain/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. </p><p>Athletes may have concerns about decreased performance with external ankle supports.
