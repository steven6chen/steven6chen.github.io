Salter type III fractures involve the joint surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76017\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76017 \">image 1</a>). They commonly need open reduction to obtain a stable joint.</p><p>Salter type IV and V fractures also typically require open reduction with internal fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Salter IV fractures are unstable, and perfect reduction is necessary for a good outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61682\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61682 \">image 2</a>). These fractures usually heal in four to six weeks. Salter type V fractures are frequently difficult to identify at initial evaluation and are followed by premature growth plate closure and growth arrest several months later. (See <a href=\"#H43\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>After healing, follow-up for all growth plate fractures is recommended at four to six months and again at a year, in order to detect any growth arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. If the radial growth plate closes and the ulna continues to grow, a wrist deformity will occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81435\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81435 \">picture 1</a>).

This injury is caused by buckling of the cortex due to compression failure. Torus fractures are stable, and treatment is aimed at pain relief, comfort, and protection of the bone from any further injury using a short arm cast or a splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67725\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67725 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81117\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81117 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, the choice of splint versus cast is dependent on the degree of initial pain, the degree of anticipated activity of the child, and parental preference. A splint can be removed for showering and minor activities, and may be preferable by some caregivers, but a cast offers more protection of the fracture site in active children. </p><p>Before treating with a splint, it is crucial to radiographically distinguish a buckle fracture from a nondisplaced greenstick fracture. Patients with greenstick fractures warrant casting as volar splints may not prevent refracture during healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Greenstick fracture'</a> below.)</p><p>Current evidence does not identify the optimal type of removable splint (eg, premolded, molded plaster or fiberglass volar splint, or Velcro splint). In the authors&rsquo; experience, a well-padded, molded volar splint (either plaster or fiberglass) or Velcro splint is easy to apply and comfortable.</p><p>A meta-analysis found four trials (three randomized and one quasi-randomized) that compared below-elbow casting with various forms of removable splinting materials (eg, premolded splint, soft bandage, molded plaster splint) for the treatment of torus fractures in 417 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In all trials, no short-term deformity occurred regardless of treatment. Two of the four trials in this meta-analysis provide data on frequency of refracture, impact of care on activities, parental preference, and pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of 201 children reported no episodes of refracture (113 splinted fractures and 85 casted fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of 87 children treated in a children's hospital compared the impact of molded plaster splints versus short arm casts on the self-reported time it took to return to normal activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Children who were splinted achieved close to normal functioning with negligible pain at 14 days, although they reported mild pain more frequently at day seven than casted children. Casted children still had mild disability at 14 days. More parents indicated that they preferred the treatment their child received in the splint group (17 out of 20, 85 percent) than in the cast group (13 out of 25, 52 percent). No refractures occurred in the 75 children for whom six month phone follow-up was available.</p><p/><p>Another small trial of 84 children treated in a children's hospital found that there was an increased duration of pain in children who received a fiberglass molded splint versus a cast (median six versus three days, p &lt;0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, splinted patients had increased baseline pain and were more likely to have a radial torus fracture.</p><p>Taken together, the evidence suggests that children with buckle fractures may be safely treated with a removable splint and that a splint may encourage earlier return to normal activities than a short arm cast. Splinting may initially be more painful than casting and may not be ideal in children with higher baseline pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up for a torus (buckle) fracture depends upon the treatment provided:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with splints may remove them at home after three weeks <strong>without</strong> orthopedic follow-up.
