Less commonly, it can occur in children with type 2 diabetes mellitus. DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus have increased across all ethnic groups. This has been coupled with an increasing awareness that children with type 2 diabetes mellitus can present with ketosis or DKA, particularly in obese African American adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].

This discussion is primarily based upon the large collective experience of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. There is limited experience in the assessment and diagnosis of DKA in children with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the same principles should apply. The management of diabetes in children, treatment of DKA in children and the epidemiology and pathogenesis of DKA are discussed separately.

Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate is a more accurate measure of ketosis and should be used whenever available. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (31 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> are consistent with DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The severity of DKA can be categorized according to the degree of acidosis as mild, moderate, or severe, (pH 7.2-7.3; pH 7.1-7.2; or pH &lt;7.1, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72608\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72608 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These abnormalities are accompanied by hyperketosis (concentration of total ketone bodies &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and hyperosmolality.

HHS occurs most commonly in adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, but has also been reported in African-American adolescents with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Recognition of HHS is important because it is reported to be associated with more severe dehydration and difficult to manage hypotension than typically occur in DKA. As in DKA, management of HHS requires carefully monitored fluid and electrolyte management, and it has been suggested that patients may require higher rates of fluid administration than are typically used in DKA. Management of HHS is discussed in a separate topic review.

Omission of insulin injections is particularly common among adolescents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress &ndash; Stress increases the secretion of catecholamines, cortisol, and glucagon, which promote both glucose and ketoacid production and in combination with decreased or missed insulin doses can precipitate DKA. This is most commonly observed in children and adolescents with chronic poor metabolic control. As an example, infection can precede an episode of DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The combined insulin insufficiency and physiologic stress can precipitate DKA. This trigger can be avoided with careful anticipatory management of insulin when the child is ill. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Special situations in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Sick-day management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications &ndash; Certain medications such as corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a>, and high dose thiazides, have precipitated DKA in individuals not previously diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs and alcohol &ndash; In adolescents with type 1 diabetes, use of illicit drugs and alcohol may further interfere with adherence to good medical management recommendations, resulting in poor metabolic control, which increases the risk for DKA. Acute ingestion of alcohol can cause hypoglycemia (rather than DKA) by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. Case reports have described recurrent DKA in individuals with hyperemesis due to cannabis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Signs and symptoms of DKA are related to the degree of hyperosmolality, volume depletion, and acidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest symptoms of DKA are related to hyperglycemia. Older children and adolescents typically present with polyuria (due to the glucose-induced osmotic diuresis), polydipsia (due to the increased urinary losses), tachycardia, and fatigue. Other findings include weight loss, nocturia (with or without secondary enuresis), daytime enuresis, and vaginal or cutaneous moniliasis. Hypovolemia may be severe if the urinary losses are not replaced.</p><p>In infants, the diagnosis is more difficult because the patients are not toilet trained and they cannot express thirst. As a result, polyuria may not be detected and polydipsia is not apparent. However, decreased energy and activity, irritability, weight loss, and physical signs of dehydration are common findings. In addition, severe Candida diaper rash or otherwise unexplained metabolic acidosis or hypovolemia should heighten the suspicion for diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diaper dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of other clinical findings may be seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyphagia usually occurs early in the course of the illness. However, once insulin deficiency becomes more severe and ketoacidosis develops, appetite is suppressed. Some patients present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which at times can mimic appendicitis or gastroenteritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperventilation and deep (Kussmaul) respirations represent the respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis. Hyperpnea results from an increase in minute volume (rate x tidal volume) and can be increased by tidal volume alone without an increase in respiratory rate. As a result, the patient's chest excursion as well as respiratory rate should be carefully observed. In infants, the hyperpnea may be manifested only by tachypnea. Patients may also have a fruity breath secondary to exhaled acetone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although children with DKA are volume depleted, they are less likely to show some of the classic signs of <strong>extracellular</strong> volume depletion such as decreased skin turgor, decreased urine output and hypotension, compared with patients with the same degree of fluid loss from acute vomiting or diarrhea. This important distinction is a reflection of chronic water loss in excess of sodium as well as water loss from hyperventilation. Water is freely distributed between the extracellular and intracellular fluids. As a result, chronic water loss produces less extracellular fluid volume depletion compared with loss of both salt and water. Water loss also is largely responsible for the marked rise in plasma osmolality. In addition, hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis maintains renal perfusion, which is why urine output is preserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, patients with DKA do display signs of intravascular volume depletion, such as tachycardia, postural changes in pulse and blood pressure and poor peripheral perfusion. Because hyperglycemia helps to maintain intravascular volume, they are rarely hypotensive. These signs often persist for 24 to 48 hours after adequate volume replacement is initiated, due to a sustained increase in epinephrine and cortisol production. Clinical estimates of the degree of dehydration are inaccurate and unlikely to be helpful. Instead, patients should be rehydrated based upon a presumed fluid deficit and clinical response.

Cerebral edema occurs in 0.5 to 1 percent of cases of DKA in children, and is the leading cause of mortality.

Measured weight loss provides the best estimate of volume depletion if an accurate recent measured weight is available for comparison. Otherwise, initial fluid management typically is based on the assumption of a 5 to 7 percent deficit for moderate DKA, and 10 to 15 percent dehydration for severe DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Nitroprusside reacts with acetoacetate and acetone but not beta-hydroxybutyrate. In DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate makes up 75 percent of the circulating ketones. Thus, clinical testing with nitroprusside may underestimate the severity of ketoacidosis and ketonuria. On the other hand, during recovery beta-hydroxybutyrate is converted to acetoacetate and acetone, which persist for a longer period. As a result, urine testing may give a false impression of persistent ketoacidosis. Therefore, direct measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate should be used whenever possible.</p><p>Blood testing for beta-hydroxybutyrate may be available both in the clinical chemistry laboratory, and more importantly, at points of care such as emergency departments and physician's offices, as well as at home (Precision Xtra, Abbott Laboratories). The meter measures a current produced during oxidation of beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, and is accurate in children and adults in a variety of clinical settings for plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of up to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (52 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The Anion Gap (AG) is useful in estimating the severity of ketosis, and the normalization of the anion gap is a direct measure of the resolution of ketoacidemia. However, the anion gap may also underestimate the degree of acidosis. The loss of ketoacid anions in the urine (as the sodium and potassium salts of beta-hydroxybutyrate and to a lesser degree acetoacetate) lowers the anion gap without affecting the plasma bicarbonate concentration or therefore the degree of acidosis.</p><p>When insulin is given to patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, metabolism of the ketoacid anions results in the regeneration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> and correction of the metabolic acidosis. For this reason, ketoacid anions have been called &quot;potential bicarbonate,&quot; and their loss in the urine represents the loss of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>. As a result, a normal AG acidosis is typically seen during the treatment phase of diabetic ketoacidosis due to the urinary loss of these bicarbonate precursors.</p><p>The serum anion gap is calculated from the following formula in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L:</span></p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Serum anion gap = Serum sodium - (Serum chloride + bicarbonate)</p></div></div><p>The normal value in children is 12&plusmn;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>.

In this setting, the patient's sodium status can be estimated by calculating a &quot;corrected&quot; plasma sodium concentration, which reflects the expected serum sodium concentration if the patient's glucose concentration were normal. In clinical practice, we estimate the contribution of hyperglycemia on the patient's serum sodium by subtracting 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for every 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> elevation in blood glucose. This estimate (or correction factor) is based upon limited experimental evidence in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], although other studies estimate a factor of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for every 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> elevation in blood glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Some centers plot the serum sodium concentration on a nomogram to track progress of the changes in plasma sodium during treatment and confirm that it is rising appropriately.

The diuresis results in water loss in excess of sodium and potassium, which will tend to raise the serum sodium concentration and plasma osmolality. Inadequate water intake, which may be a particular problem in hot weather and in infants and young children who cannot independently access water, prevents partial correction of the hyperosmolality and can even lead to hypernatremia despite the presence of hyperglycemia. On the other hand, consumption of large volumes of dilute fluid, since thirst is stimulated by hyperosmolality, can contribute to hyponatremia.</p><p/><p>A third factor that can affect the measured serum sodium concentration represents a laboratory artifact. Hyperlipidemia can cause pseudohyponatremia by reducing the fraction of plasma that is water. As a result, the amount of sodium in the specimen is reduced and the measured plasma sodium concentration will be lower, even though the physiologically important plasma water sodium concentration and plasma osmolality are not affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

However, the combination of insulin deficiency, which impairs potassium entry into the cells, and hyperosmolality, which pulls water and potassium out of the cells, tends to raise the serum potassium concentration.
