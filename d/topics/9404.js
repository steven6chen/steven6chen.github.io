(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples of steps in the process and approaches to targeting them include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sickle mutation</strong> &ndash; Gene therapy, hematopoietic cell transplantation.

However, clinical experience with HCT remains limited, and many experts consider HCT to be an experimental therapy that should only be performed in the context of a clinical trial.</p><p>Many physicians taking care of patients with SCD have adopted a wait-and-see approach to HCT because of the variability in the clinical course of SCD, the uncertainty in identifying patients who are most likely to have severe disease complications, the risks associated with the procedure, and the possibility that investigational therapies with fewer toxicities may become available in the reasonably near future.</p><p>Additional information about HCT in patients with SCD including donor selection, conditioning regimens, and outcomes is presented in detail separately.

Another approach is to provide an alternative beta globin gene that has &quot;corrective&quot; properties. In vitro studies and animal models have provided evidence for the feasibility of these approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. However, issues remain related to the safety and efficacy of the delivery viruses (or other delivery methods).</p><p>As with other autosomal recessive conditions, it is not necessary to completely eliminate production of the mutant gene. Approximately 50 percent reduction of HbS or 50 percent expression of another normal beta globin-like chain will convert the individual from SCD to a clinical phenotype similar to sickle cell trait, which is essentially a benign carrier condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-trait\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle cell trait&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1695887754\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta globin gene correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCD is caused by a single pathogenic point mutation, and reversion to the wild-type sequence at one or both alleles of the beta globin gene locus could convert SCD to sickle cell trait, a benign carrier condition, or to normal adult hemoglobin. Gene correction, which takes advantage of homology-directed repair, and gene editing are processes by which a wild-type beta globin gene is used as a template for endonucleases to &quot;repair&quot; the mutant sequence (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms#H3828842802\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;, section on 'Gene editing'</a>). A preclinical model using this approach was able to correct the sickle mutation in cultured bone marrow cells from patients with SCD, and cells manipulated in this manner could differentiate and restore hematopoiesis in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3499757082\"><span class=\"h3\">Insertion of an anti-sickling beta globin gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An artificial version of the beta globin gene has been created that creates an amino acid substitution of glutamine for threonine at position 87 (beta globin T87Q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This amino acid switch does not remove the sickle mutation, but it replicates the region of the gamma globin sequence that is thought to block polymerization of sickle hemoglobin in the red blood cell.</p><p>In a 2017 case report, a 13-year-old boy with SCD who had multiple vaso-occlusive pain episodes and other SCD complications that were not improved with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> or chronic transfusions was treated with an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant in which his own hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with this &quot;anti-sickling variant&quot; and returned to him after myeloablative chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Following engraftment, he had increasing expression of the variant until it reached stable levels of approximately 50 percent of total hemoglobin at nine months, with a reciprocal decline in HbS expression. He became transfusion-independent, required no further analgesics, and had no vaso-occlusive events during the post-transplant observation period of more than 15 months. There were no major adverse events other than the expected cytotoxicity of the conditioning regimen. Additional studies are underway to expand this approach to other individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3287446967\"><span class=\"h3\">Gamma globin gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gamma globin gene is the source of beta globin-like chains for fetal hemoglobin (HbF), the predominant hemoglobin expressed in late gestation and early infancy.

It is a separate gene from beta globin and thus does not contain the sickle mutation.

HbF is comprised of two alpha globin chains and two gamma globin (rather than beta globin) chains; the genes for gamma globin and beta globin are adjacent to each other in the beta gene cluster (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>). Gamma globin chains do not carry the sickle mutation. When present, HbF dilutes out HbS, ameliorating the clinical severity of SCD.

None of these has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in patients with SCD, but work from mouse models and cell lines are encouraging, and in some cases clinical trials are ongoing.

In contrast, HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, leading to precipitation and gel formation within the cell. The rate of polymerization depends on the intracellular HbS concentration. Once polymerization occurs, polymerization-induced membrane damage leads to cellular dehydration, which in turn further increases the HbS concentration, resulting in a cycle of worsening polymerization. This creates a population of very dense cells that are much more prone to sickling and contribute disproportionately to vaso-occlusion.
