These conditions, termed &quot;syndromic immunodeficiencies,&quot; are in contrast to primary immunodeficiencies, in which infection is the primary manifestation and the immune problem is well characterized. A large variety of manifestations have been described in the different syndromic immunodeficiencies, and a number of organ systems may be involved. Some of these conditions feature metabolic derangements or chromosomal anomalies.</p><p>Several genetic disorders may well be considered as both primary and syndromic immunodeficiencies since they have both characteristic organ dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysmorphology unrelated to the immune system, as well as a consistent, well-defined immunodeficiency. Conditions such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia could be considered as fitting both categories and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wiskott-aldrich-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ataxia-telangiectasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ataxia-telangiectasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recognition of a syndromic immunodeficiency is important in several respects. For a patient with nonimmune-related anomalies who presents to the immunologist, it is critical to ascertain if the constellation of malformations is diagnostic for a specific syndrome. This may aid in giving an accurate prognosis for the immune defect. In addition, the diagnosis may alert the clinician to monitor for abnormalities in other organ systems. The prognosis for cognitive or motor development may also be impacted. Alternatively, if a child with one of these syndromes presents initially with nonimmune medical problems, then it is important to establish if an immune defect is present so that appropriate intervention can be undertaken. In addition, being able to establish the correct diagnosis may also have implications for the recurrence risk of future pregnancies of the patient or the patient's family and relatives.</p><p>In this topic review, we will focus on the more common syndromic immunodeficiencies in which immune defects are noted. A number of other syndromic immunodeficiencies are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75043 \">table 1</a>).

Bloom syndrome has been reported in a variety of ethnic groups, with an increased frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. This condition is discussed in detail separately.

The condition has been most frequently described in patients of Eastern European ancestry. This disorder is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nijmegen-breakage-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nijmegen breakage syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1102765182\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These conditions, termed &quot;syndromic immunodeficiencies,&quot; are in contrast to primary immunodeficiencies, in which infection is the primary manifestation and the immune problem is well characterized. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition caused by defective chromosomal methylation. Mental retardation frequently occurs. Characteristic facial features include ocular hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, and low-set ears. Immunodeficiency is manifest by the development of sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous infections. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'ICF syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS2) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by partial albinism, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Neurologic involvement may be progressive. Patients are susceptible to fungal, viral, and bacterial infections. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Griscelli syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia is an autosomal recessive condition with the principal features of short stature (often with prenatal growth deficiency), spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, defective cellular immunity, and progressive renal failure. Patients are prone to viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roifman syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, developmental delay, and retinal dystrophy. (See <a href=\"#H4290605047\" class=\"local\">'Roifman syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial deletions of chromosome 4p are associated with mental retardation, growth deficiency, and immunodeficiencies. Patients have frequent episodes of respiratory infections due in part to recurrent aspiration. Antibody deficiencies are common, but T cell immunity is normal. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Partial deletions of chromosome 4p (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syndromic immunodeficiencies that are discussed in other topic reviews include cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH); p14 deficiency; deletion of the 22q11.2 chromosome region that is associated with the clinical conditions DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), and (less commonly) Opitz <span class=\"nowrap\">G/BBB</span> syndrome; deletions of the chromosome region 10p13-p14 that are also associated with DiGeorge syndrome; Bloom syndrome; and Nijmegen breakage syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cartilage-hair-hypoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cartilage-hair hypoplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Velocardiofacial (Shprintzen) syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloom-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bloom syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nijmegen-breakage-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nijmegen breakage syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several genetic disorders may well be considered as both primary and syndromic immunodeficiencies since they have both characteristic organ dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysmorphology unrelated to the immune system, as well as a consistent, well-defined immune deficiency. Conditions such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia could be considered as fitting both categories and are discussed separately.
