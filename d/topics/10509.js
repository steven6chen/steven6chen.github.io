It commonly occurs on the extensor surface of the elbows or knees, or the scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54581%7EDERM%2F87441%7EDERM%2F87443\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54581 graphicRef87441 graphicRef87443 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Psoriasis commonly occurs in women of reproductive age because three-quarters of patients develop the disease before reaching age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of psoriasis in pregnant women will be reviewed here. The general treatment of psoriasis and pustular psoriasis of pregnancy, a severe pustular form of psoriasis, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatoses-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatoses of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of psoriasis in a woman who is pregnant raises unique considerations. Examples include the impact of maternal psoriasis on the fetus, therapeutic restrictions during pregnancy, and the effects of pregnancy on psoriasis severity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impact of psoriasis on pregnancy outcomes </strong>&ndash; Few studies have investigated the impact of psoriasis on pregnancy outcomes, leaving the relationship between psoriasis and pregnancy outcomes unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A systematic review of observational studies that evaluated the relationship between psoriasis and pregnancy outcomes found that four of the nine included studies reported increased risk for at least one adverse fetal outcome (spontaneous abortion, caesarean delivery, low birth weight, macrosomia, large-for-gestational age, or a composite outcome that included prematurity and low birth weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, study results were inconsistent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impact of pregnancy on treatment choices </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Choosing drug therapies that pose the least risk to the fetus is the major issue in managing the pregnancies of affected women. Ideally, women should try to plan pregnancy when they are in remission and they are off medication or are taking the minimum effective dose of medications that have the best fetal safety profiles. Because many women with moderate to severe psoriasis do not achieve complete remissions, postponing pregnancy until a period of remission often is unrealistic in this population. The selection of treatments with good fetal safety profiles is particularly important for these patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment principles'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impact on severity of psoriasis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Psoriasis improves during pregnancy in 40 to 60 percent of women, worsens in 10 to 20 percent, and remains stable in the remainder. Improvement may be dramatic. In a prospective study, among 16 women with greater than 10 percent body surface area involvement with psoriasis who experienced improvement in psoriasis during pregnancy, the mean reduction in psoriatic lesions between 10 and 30 weeks gestation was 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the postpartum period, psoriasis severity remains the same or worsens in most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impact on risk of psoriasis in biological children </strong>&ndash; Children of women with psoriasis have an increased risk for the development of the disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis#H28372879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of psoriasis in nonpregnant individuals can be divided into three broad categories: topical therapy, phototherapy, and systemic therapy. Choice of therapy is based upon the severity of the disease and its impact on the patient's overall sense of well-being, relevant comorbidities, patient preference (including cost and convenience), efficacy, and evaluation of individual patient response. Psoriasis involving limited areas of skin (eg, less than 5 to 10 percent the body surface area) can often be managed topically. Phototherapy or systemic therapy is usually necessary for adequate treatment of more extensive disease. Topical therapy and phototherapy is generally preferred over systemic therapy for the treatment of pregnant women because of concern for safety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment paradigm is the same for both pregnant and nonpregnant patients, except that some medications are avoided in pregnancy and the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio may be calculated differently because fetal risk must also be taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. We agree with a recommendation from the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation that topical treatment with emollients or moisturizers and a low- or medium-potency topical corticosteroid is the first-line medical intervention for pregnant women with limited psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. UVB phototherapy (particularly narrowband UVB) is the preferred treatment for women with more severe symptoms. </p><p>When women receiving systemic therapy for psoriasis become pregnant, the decision must be made whether to continue treatment or to transition to topical therapy or phototherapy. Although contraindicated therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) must be discontinued, the appropriate action is less definitive for patients receiving other systemic treatments. Because many women with psoriasis improve during pregnancy, women may be able to switch to phototherapy during the prenatal period. Biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> are occasionally used during pregnancy for women with severe disease who cannot transition to topical therapy or phototherapy. In these situations, the potential risks and benefits of therapy must be considered carefully. (See <a href=\"#H464712024\" class=\"local\">'Third-line therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H464711110\" class=\"local\">'Contraindicated therapies'</a> below.) </p><p>In our discussion of treatment, we list the previously used US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) letter (A, B, C, D, and X) categories assigned to help evaluate pregnancy risk. The FDA will no longer be using this labeling and has begun to introduce narrative descriptions of the data available for the use of new drugs during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Treatment of nonpregnant individuals is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment selection for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in special populations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464711532\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women with limited psoriasis (non-debilitating psoriasis that involves less than 5 to 10 percent of the body surface area) can be managed sufficiently with topical therapy. Emollients, moisturizers, and low- to medium-potency topical corticosteroids are the preferred topical therapies for this population based upon safety considerations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464711513\"><span class=\"h3\">Emollients and moisturizers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The simplest topical therapies are emollients or moisturizers, which may control bothersome scale. Use of these agents is well tolerated, lacking significant adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For limited psoriasis, intermittent topical corticosteroids may control disease with no or minimal maternal or fetal risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Most topical corticosteroids are classified by the FDA as pregnancy category C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F50021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50021 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Corticosteroids'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review did not find sufficient evidence to link topical corticosteroid use to increased risk for congenital abnormalities, preterm delivery, or stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, there may be an association between use of potent topical corticosteroids and low birthweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In particular, a retrospective study found a correlation between low birth weight and high levels of potent or very potent topical corticosteroid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Use during pregnancy or lactation'</a>.)</p><p>Therefore, for pregnant women who will be treated with topical corticosteroids for psoriasis, the use of low- or medium-potency topical corticosteroids is preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. We reserve the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids for patients who fail treatment with lower-potency topical corticosteroids.</p><p>Of note, the development of striae (stretch marks) is common in pregnancy and use of topical corticosteroids may increase risk for striae in sites of application. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464711787\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When topical therapy with emollients, moisturizers, or topical corticosteroids is insufficient or impractical due to resistant disease or extensive skin involvement, narrowband UVB phototherapy is often useful for treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">UVB phototherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phototherapy can be used to treat localized psoriasis or the entire cutaneous surface area. Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy at wavelength 311 nm appears to be a safe and often effective treatment of psoriasis in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The major disadvantage of this approach is the need to travel to a clinic three days per week for treatment. Broadband UVB (290 to 320 nm) is a slightly less effective alternative that can be used if narrowband UVB is not available. Localized disease can be treated with a laser device that emits UVB (eg, 308 nm excimer laser) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Ultraviolet light'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVB therapy (broadband and narrowband)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients receiving phototherapy generally require adjuvant therapy with emollients, moisturizers, or low- to medium-potency topical corticosteroids for symptomatic relief. </p><p>Common adverse effects of UVB phototherapy include erythema, skin dryness, and pruritus. Exacerbation of melasma, a photosensitive skin disorder commonly associated with pregnancy, also is a potential risk of phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Melasma is characterized by the development of hyperpigmentation on sun-exposed skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64109\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64109 \">picture 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melasma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Melasma&quot;</a>). Additional adverse effects associated with phototherapy are reviewed separately.

Concerns regarding the effect of UV light exposure decreasing serum folate levels are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Folate deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464712024\"><span class=\"h2\">Third-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pregnant women with psoriasis can be managed effectively with the therapies described above. Patients who cannot be managed effectively with the topical moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, or phototherapy may require systemic therapy to achieve sufficient improvement in symptoms. Biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> can be effective for these patients. However, data on safety in pregnant women are limited and the need for systemic treatment should be considered carefully.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464712088\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-TNF biologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data on the use of anti-TNF biologic agents in pregnancy are limited, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating that the biologic TNF-inhibitors used for psoriasis may be used safely during pregnancy. The TNF-inhibiting biologic therapies indicated for psoriasis (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) are classified by the FDA as category B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F50021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50021 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Biologic agents'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, because biologic TNF-inhibitors can cross the placenta and can be detected in infants for up to several months after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], there is concern for the possibility of postpartum effects on infants born to treated women. Although the best approach is unconfirmed, discontinuation of these drugs prior to the end of gestation and postponement of live vaccine administration to infants has been suggested. For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, drug discontinuation is suggested at 30 weeks gestation (based upon the knowledge that transmission across the placenta primarily occurs in the third trimester) and avoidance of live vaccine administration to infants born to treated women is suggested until the age of seven months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Similar precautions may be appropriate for other biologic TNF-inhibitors. An infant exposed to infliximab in utero died from disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) infection after receipt of the BCG vaccine at the age of three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The manufacturers of all the biologic medications for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis manage ongoing registries of drug-exposed pregnant women and encourage enrollment of all such cases.

It can be very effective in treating severe cutaneous psoriasis. </p><p>Teratogenicity data in humans are derived primarily from organ transplant recipients. The risk of teratogenicity among the offspring of women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> appears to be low, but premature labor and infants who are small for gestational age have been reported. Such findings may be related to the underlying medical condition rather than to the drug, and could also be related to both the medical condition and the drug.

Choosing drug therapies that pose the least risk to the fetus is the major issue in managing the pregnancies of affected women. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment principles'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideally, women should plan pregnancy when they are in remission and off medication or taking the minimum effective dose of medications that have the best fetal safety profiles. However, postponing pregnancy until a period of remission often is unrealistic. The selection of treatments with good fetal safety profiles is particularly important for these patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psoriasis improves during pregnancy in 40 to 60 percent of women, worsens in 10 to 20 percent, and remains stable in the remainder. In women who improve, the degree of improvement can be dramatic. In the postpartum period, psoriasis severity remains the same or worsens in most women. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with limited psoriasis (ie, non-debilitating psoriasis that involves less than 5 to 10 percent of the body surface area), we suggest topical rather than systemic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Emollients and moisturizers are useful for reducing bothersome scale. Our first-line medical treatment is a low- to medium-potency topical corticosteroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>).

Because psoriasis often improves during pregnancy, women who required systemic treatment prior to pregnancy may be able to transition to phototherapy.
