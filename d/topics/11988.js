This combination can produce weight losses of 5 to 10 percent below baseline weight. Some patients eventually require the addition of pharmacologic therapy or <span class=\"nowrap\">bariatric/metabolic</span> surgery to achieve or maintain weight loss.</p><p>The goal of behavioral therapy is to help patients make long-term changes through the modification and monitoring of both their eating behavior and physical activity level. This is largely achieved by controlling cues and stimuli in the environment that trigger eating or sedentary behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The use of behavioral strategies to treat obesity in adults is reviewed here. Other therapies for obesity, including drug therapy, specific diets, exercise, and surgery are reviewed separately.

The higher the body mass index (BMI), the greater the risk of morbidity and mortality. Overwhelming evidence exists that weight loss can decrease disease risk. Hence, the overarching goal of treating obesity is to prevent, reverse, or ameliorate the complications of obesity and improve quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than two-thirds of adults in the United States are either trying to lose weight or maintain their weight at any given time. However, only 20 percent are both eating fewer calories and exercising on a regular basis. Thus, clinicians can play an important role in educating people regarding the need for and the optimal strategies for losing weight. Behavioral-based treatment programs improve weight loss results and are associated with improvements in obesity-associated morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H386459340\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management#H447678688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Goals of treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1989275734\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS BEHAVIORAL THERAPY?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavior modification or behavior therapy is considered to be an essential component of managing the patient with overweight or obesity. The goals are to help patients make long-term changes in their eating behavior by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifying and monitoring their food intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifying their physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Controlling cues and stimuli in the environment that trigger eating</p><p/><p>Behavioral interventions aimed at weight loss have <span class=\"nowrap\">reduced/delayed</span> the onset of type 2 diabetes and decreased cardiovascular risk factors in people at risk for diabetes. In individuals with diabetes, behavioral interventions have also shown significant reduction in cardiovascular risk factors (Look AHEAD [Action for Health in Diabetes]) but not cardiovascular events or death. Behavioral therapy approaches from clinical trials (Diabetes Prevention Program [DPP] and Look AHEAD) have also been successfully applied to &quot;real-world&quot; settings such as primary care practices. (See <a href=\"#H386459340\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>A principal determinant of weight loss appears to be the degree of adherence to the program. Thus, patient preference is an important consideration when recommending any behavioral weight loss program (see <a href=\"#H3318202686\" class=\"local\">'Choice of intervention'</a> below). The concepts described are included in most behavioral therapy programs conducted by psychologists, other trained personnel, and many self-help groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Assumptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two basic assumptions underlying behavioral therapy for overweight patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first is that individuals with obesity have <strong>learned maladaptive patterns</strong> of eating and exercise that are contributing to weight gain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintenance of their overweight state.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second is that these <strong>behaviors can be modified</strong> and that weight loss will result. With this theory, principles of learning from schools of classical and operant conditioning are applied in training new behaviors. Thus, behavioral treatment for the patient who is overweight seeks to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alter the environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alter environmental reinforcement contingencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shape eating behavior and physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide health benefits by reducing the risk for developing diseases associated with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Elements of behavioral strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comprehensive lifestyle interventions usually provide a structured behavioral program that includes a number of components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting realistic goals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-monitoring (keeping food diaries and activity records)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Controlling or modifying the stimuli that activate eating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating style (slowing down the eating process)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral contracting and reinforcement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrition education and meal planning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive restructuring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problem-solving</p><p/><p>These same behaviors are recommended to maintain lost weight, with the addition of frequent (ie, weekly or more often) monitoring of body weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2025825639\"><span class=\"h3\">Setting realistic goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in eating behavior require time and commitment, and it is important for the patient and health care provider to set realistic weight loss goals, such as 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/week,</span> or 5 to 10 percent of baseline weight within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. To achieve this goal, participants are encouraged to reduce energy intake by 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day,</span> which can be done with diet instruction, provision of food, or the use of portion-controlled foods. Evidence from the Look AHEAD trial shows that individuals with larger month-to-month weight losses and more sustained weight loss during the first year had better maintenance of weight loss over four years, independent of characteristics traditionally linked to weight loss success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Goals of weight loss'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-monitoring, often involving the use of food diaries, activity records, and self-weighing, is one of the elements of a successful behavioral weight loss program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. The participants are instructed in how to record everything they eat, the calories in the food, and the situation in which they are eating. The National Weight Control registry, a study of 4000 individuals who had lost at least 30 lbs (13.6 kg) and kept it off for at least one year, reports that self-monitoring is one of the most frequently used techniques among patients who successfully lose weight and maintain the weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a systematic review of 22 studies evaluating the relationship between self-monitoring and weight loss, there was a consistent association between self-monitoring (of weight, diet, and exercise) and successful weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A variety of methods were used to perform self-monitoring, including paper diaries, internet applications, personal digital assistants, and digital scales for recording weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Stimulus control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulus control is another element in a behavioral program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It focuses on gaining control over the environmental factors that trigger eating and eliminating or modifying the environmental factors that facilitate overeating. Since food is a key issue in weight gain, participants are taught to buy more fresh fruits and vegetables, to prepare easy-to-eat lower calorie foods, and to place them prominently in the refrigerator or on the counter. The proximity of food and the shape and size of serving containers may influence how much is eaten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Stimulus control also includes making the act of eating a focus of its own. Thus, turning off the television set and putting down reading materials may allow the individual to concentrate on eating. Stimulus control in children who substituted active behaviors for sedentary behaviors was associated with a significantly smaller rise in body mass index (BMI) Z-scores at 6 and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Eating style</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since eating is central to ingesting food, slowing down the process may give &quot;physiological&quot; signals for fullness time to come into play. Two ways to slow down eating include concentrating on the tastes of the food and savoring what is being eaten by chewing more slowly. Other techniques might involve leaving the table briefly during a meal and drinking water between bites or just prior to the meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3930992533\"><span class=\"h3\">Regular weighing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular self-weighing as a strategy for self-monitoring has been recommended in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. There were concerns that regular weighing might lead to anxiety and weight regain, but this was not observed in a systematic literature review of 17 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral contracting and reinforcement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reinforcing successful outcomes and providing small tokens for success may be beneficial. For example, patients can earn credit for gasoline or merchandise (not food) for successful completion of various activities in a behavior program.</p><p>Financial incentives can also serve to enhance weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As an example, in a 24-week trial, 105 employees (BMI 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> were randomly assigned to receive financial incentive, either as individuals or as members of a five-member group, or to a control group with monthly weigh-ins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The financial reward was distributed at the end of each month to individuals who met a prescribed weight loss target. The group-incentive participants shared the reward (which was five times the individual reward) evenly but only among those who met the target weight loss goal. The five members of the group were unknown to each other. The group-incentive participants lost significantly more weight than individual-incentive and control groups (4.8, 1.7, and 0.5 kg, respectively) and also received larger payouts than individual-incentive participants (USD $514 versus $128 over five months). The opportunity to earn a larger reward, by acquiring the incentive that other group members forfeited by not meeting the monthly goal, may have been a motivating factor for group-incentive participants. This suggests that variable incentives within a group may be better than specified individual ones.</p><p>In contrast with financial incentives, social contingency, ie, having access to the group only if the participant met specific weight loss goals, did not improve weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutritional education and meal planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutrition education and meal planning are also good behavioral strategies. Providing a defined meal structure results in greater weight loss than does the absence of such a structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Use of portion-controlled plates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] or diets is one of the strategies for providing this structured environment for eating.</p><p>Dietary counseling appears to facilitate weight loss, particularly during the first year of weight loss programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Use of meal replacements enhanced weight loss, albeit modestly, in the Look AHEAD trial in the first four years, but their use diminished over the eight years in the trial, as did their relation to successful weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Increasing physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing physical activity is another part of a successful behavioral program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Along with self-monitoring, increasing physical activity was a key element in success for members of the National Weight Control Registry, a group of more than 4000 individuals who had lost at least 13.6 kg (30 lbs) and kept it off for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These individuals had lost an average of 33 kg and maintained it for an average of 5.7 years. Women in the Registry reported expending 2545 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/week</span> in exercise and men 3293 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/week</span> in exercise. This would be equivalent to approximately one hour per day of moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, the amount of weight lost in the Look AHEAD trial over eight years was related to the amount of physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>However, the characteristics of behavioral programs that best predict weight loss are still unclear. In a meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials of multicomponent behavioral weight management programs, calorie counting, contact with a dietitian, and use of certain behavior change techniques were associated with greater weight loss than supervised physical activity sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The role of exercise in obesity is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Social support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enhancing social support may also be a means for improving long-term weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Inclusion of family members or spouses is one way to accomplish this. There are both short- and long-term benefits to programs that include strong family support. In a meta-analysis of four 12-month behavioral programs that included family members, mean weight loss in the family-based intervention was approximately 3 kg more than in the control behavioral programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Social support can also work to the advantage of the family member not participating in the trial. In the Look AHEAD trial, which is a randomized trial of intensive lifestyle modification in patients with type 2 diabetes, the spouses of those in the intervention group lost 2.2 to 4.4 kg, whereas spouses of those in the control group gained up to 3.3 kg in body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The Look AHEAD trial is reviewed separately.

In the Look AHEAD and DPP trials, 65 to 68 percent of individuals lost more than 5 percent of their body weight, and 29 to 37 percent lost more than 10 percent over the first year of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Both studies had substantial weight regain over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>After a median follow-up of 9.6 years in the Look AHEAD trial, which compared an intensive lifestyle intervention with a diabetes support and education control group, there was no reduction in the primary outcome of cardiovascular mortality, possibly due to the lower than expected rates of cardiovascular events in both groups and to the small difference in weight loss between the two groups by study end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, there were other improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and obesity-associated morbidities. For example, the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea was reduced, and mobility and quality of life improved compared with the control group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Lifestyle intervention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H6062398\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Intensive lifestyle modification'</a>.)</p><p>In a systematic review of 38 trials assessing behaviorally based interventions compared with usual care, most trials showed a statistically significant effect on weight loss with the intervention at 12 to 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The interventions included regular patient education sessions (eg, healthy diet choices, physical activity, weight loss goals, barriers to weight loss), regular weight checks, and peer support. The intervention groups lost 1.5 to 5 kg, whereas controls lost little or no weight. Subjects participating in behavioral interventions that included more sessions (12 to 26) lost more weight (4 to 7 kg versus 1.5 to 4 kg) than those participating in fewer than 12 sessions.</p><p>A subsequent systematic review reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mean changes in weight from baseline ranged from a loss of 0.3 to 6.6 kg in the intervention groups compared with a gain of 0.9 to a loss of 2.0 kg in the control groups. Interventions that combined dietary therapy (reduced energy intake) and increased physical activity with behavioral therapy were more successful in reducing weight than interventions without all three components.</p><p>Health benefits of behavioral therapy aimed at weight loss have also been demonstrated outside of clinical trials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) has adopted behavioral therapy approaches from clinical trials (DPP and LOOK AHEAD) to &quot;real-world&quot; settings, such as primary care practices and the YMCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3259151204\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-help or commercial weight loss programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-help or commercial weight loss programs incorporate varying degrees of behavioral modification strategies. They can be expensive, employ very low-calorie diets, and only some have been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. Since the commercial programs do not carry any higher risk than other dietary programs, the patient and health care provider can select among programs, with the recommendation that programs with clinically demonstrated efficacy be the first choice (eg, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig). Because adherence to weight loss programs is important for long-term success, patient preference is another important consideration when recommending any weight loss program.

The three largest commercial programs were Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and Nutrisystem.</p><p>Compared with a <span class=\"nowrap\">control/education</span> group (no intervention, printed materials, health education, or limited sessions with a clinician) or behavioral counseling, participants in the following programs achieved significantly greater weight loss at 12 months:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight Watchers participants achieved 2.6 percent greater weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jenny Craig participants achieved 4.9 percent greater weight loss</p><p/><p>In addition, participants who followed an Atkins diet achieved 0.1 to 2.9 percent greater weight loss than controls at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Some very low-calorie meal replacement programs (HMR, Medifast, and Optifast) result in short-term weight loss outcomes superior to those of <span class=\"nowrap\">control/education</span> and behavioral counseling, but whether these results can be sustained in the long term is unclear (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of weight loss'</a> below). Additional details about dietary therapy are reviewed separately.

Internet-based weight loss programs are widely available, including self-help and commercial weight loss programs that historically used only in-person group meetings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/50-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-58</a>]. Available data suggest that programs with a behavior modification component are more effective than those without.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important elements include guidance and feedback from a trained interventionist and high-intensity treatment that lasts six months with at least 14 sessions. This approach is based on the face-to-face experience in studies where success is proportional to the frequency of interactions. In one report, patients who received 20 calls over six months lost an average of 4.9 kg compared with 3.2 and 2.3 kg, respectively, for those receiving either 10 or no calls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Telephone-based counseling may also be effective for maintaining weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low-intensity, weekly email intervention is more effective if weekly lifestyle modification counseling is added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Individual support from an <span class=\"nowrap\">interventionist/coach</span> is particularly effective.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9386864\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that patients choose the behavioral program that best fits their needs, as long as it includes the essential elements outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Elements of behavioral strategies'</a> above.)</p><p>There are a number of behavioral approaches that can achieve weight loss goals, including face-to-face (individual or group), internet-based, and mobile applications. While some patients might prefer individual therapy, the group setting may be more cost effective, and there is insufficient evidence to conclude that one is better than the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/6,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,59,60</a>]. All interventions use similar behavioral strategies, which are outlined above (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Elements of behavioral strategies'</a> above). They can be delivered in many different settings, including health care offices, <span class=\"nowrap\">gyms/clubs,</span> and commercial weight loss centers. The addition of wearable technology was not helpful in one trial.

For example, behavioral therapy (that includes the elements described above), combined with dietary therapy (reduced energy intake) and increased physical activity, is more successful in reducing weight than interventions without all three components. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Elements of behavioral strategies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H386459340\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high-intensity program (at least 12 sessions over six months) with frequent reinforcement is more likely to be successful than a shorter program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. One of the major lessons of the past 30 years is that programs of greater length are more effective than those of shorter length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the 1970s, behavioral weight loss programs typically lasted eight weeks with an average weight loss of 3.8 kg, but by the 1990s, as treatment duration lengthened, typical weight loss was 8.5 kg after 21 weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4040691366\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral-based programs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular patient education on healthy diet choices, physical activity, weight loss goals, and barriers to weight loss, as well as regular weight checks and peer support, help facilitate weight loss.

Although many individuals succeed in losing weight with diet <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral therapy, most patients subsequently regain most of the lost weight. These up-and-down periods, sometimes referred to as &quot;weight cycles,&quot; enhanced the risk of developing diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 45 trials in over 7700 individuals who initially had lost &ge;5 percent of body weight, subsequent behavioral interventions showed a small but significant benefit compared with controls (mean difference in weight regain -1.56 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/13,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,62</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], trials suggest that individuals receiving face-to face interventions may initially regain less weight than those receiving internet-based interventions, but both groups eventually regain similar amounts of weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Follow-up phone calls providing maintenance training may help prevent weight regain. In a randomized trial comparing a phone-based weight loss maintenance program (relapse prevention techniques, self-monitoring, and social support, n = 110) or usual care (no contact except for weight measurements, n = 112) for middle-aged men who had lost &ge;4 kg during the previous 16 weeks, mean weight regain over the subsequent year was lower in the intervention compared with the control group (0.75 versus 2.4 kg, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2160641712\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In addition, some patients eventually need the options of adding pharmacologic therapy or bariatric surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral treatment of obesity is a standard part of most treatment programs. The goal of this approach is to help patients make long-term changes in their eating behavior by modifying and monitoring their food intake, increasing their physical activity, and controlling cues and stimuli in the environment that trigger eating. Physical activity and self-monitoring are particularly important components for success. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Assumptions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Elements of behavioral strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are overweight or obese and who are attempting to lose weight, we suggest weight loss programs that include behavior modification strategies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A high-intensity program (at least 12 sessions over six months) with frequent reinforcement is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H9386864\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A principal determinant of weight loss appears to be the degree of adherence to the program. Thus, patient preference is an important consideration when recommending any behavioral weight loss program. Some may prefer the convenience and possible lower cost of internet programs, while others may prefer the support provided by individual or group sessions. (See <a href=\"#H9386864\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are overweight or obese and who have lost weight, we suggest that behavior modification strategies be continued to minimize subsequent weight gain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
