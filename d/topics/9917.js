Many over-the-counter products are marketed. In addition, a number of procedural therapies are utilized for the treatment of acne vulgaris with variable effectiveness.</p><p>The use of over-the-counter and light-based therapies as well as several adjunctive therapies (office-based chemical peels, microdermabrasion, comedo extraction, intralesional glucocorticoids, and heat therapy) will be reviewed here. Conventional therapies, hormonal therapy, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> therapy for acne vulgaris are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-isotretinoin-therapy-for-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER TOPICAL MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many people with acne, treatment begins with nonprescription regimens. Numerous products are available, and nonprescription treatments are effective for some individuals. Some of the most common ingredients found in nonprescription acne products include salicylic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a>, sulfur, and alpha hydroxy acids. Tea tree oil has also been used for treatment of acne. In July 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adapalene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adapalene</a> 0.1% gel for over-the-counter use, making it the first topical retinoid approved for distribution directly to consumers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Topical retinoids'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with mild to moderate acne who do not respond to nonprescription products after three months of treatment should be clinically evaluated. Patients with more severe acne should be evaluated earlier, to consider the use of the most effective treatment regimens to prevent or minimize scarring.</p><p>Topical nonprescription acne therapies are generally well tolerated. However, rare but serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to nonprescription topical acne products containing salicylic acid or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a> have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whether these active ingredients or inactive ingredients are responsible for the reactions is unclear. Symptoms may occur within minutes to one day or longer after product use and may include severe skin reactions, throat tightness, difficulty breathing, feeling faint, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips, or tongue. The US FDA recommends limiting application of these products to one or two small affected areas during the initial three days of use to test for hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Salicylic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salicylic acid (0.5 to 2%) is a beta hydroxy acid available in a number of nonprescription gels, lotions, solutions, cleansers, pads, and masks. It is a desquamating agent, and its lipophilic properties enable it to penetrate the pilosebaceous follicle, producing a comedolytic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Topical salicylic acid also possesses mild anti-inflammatory properties. Salicylic acid is usually applied once daily and subsequently increased to two or three times per day if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The frequency of application can be reduced to once daily or every other day if the patient develops skin dryness or peeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In three placebo-controlled studies, salicylic acid was an effective treatment for acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is a treatment option for patients who cannot tolerate topical retinoids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Salicylic acid can also be used in combination with benzoyl peroxide, as the mechanisms of action of these drugs complement each other in the treatment of acne. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Benzoyl peroxide'</a>.)</p><p>Higher concentrations of salicylic acid may be used in the office to perform superficial chemical peels.

The drug is an effective treatment for inflammatory and comedonal acne. It is available in both nonprescription and prescription formulations.

The mechanism of action remains unknown. It is thought that sulfur interacts with cysteine in keratinocytes, resulting in the production of hydrogen sulfide, which has a keratolytic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sulfur also inhibits the proliferation of <em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>)<em> acnes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Older formulations of sulfur were sometimes offensive to patients due to an unpleasant, rotten egg-like odor. This odor is minimized in newer formulations.</p><p>Sulfur is often combined with salicylic acid in nonprescription products. In addition, sulfur has been studied in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a>. In a case series of 113 patients with acne, a combination of 2.5 to 5% sulfur and 10% benzoyl peroxide was efficacious for the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Prescription products that combine sulfur with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfacetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfacetamide</a>, an ingredient with antibacterial properties, are available and have been effective in open-label studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Alpha hydroxy acids are weak organic acids that cause desquamation and diminish corneocyte cohesion, thereby normalizing follicular keratinization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These agents may also promote dispersing of basal layer melanin, which can help to improve postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.</p><p>Alpha hydroxy acids in low concentrations and buffered alpha hydroxy acids in higher concentrations are available as over the counter washes, lotions, creams, and at-home peel systems. High concentrations with more free acid are used in the office to perform superficial chemical peels. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Office-based superficial chemical peels'</a> below.)</p><p>Only low-quality evidence is available regarding the use of low concentrations of alpha hydroxy acids for the treatment of acne. Alpha hydroxy acids may be most effective as components of a treatment regimen containing other acne medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Glycolic acid is generally considered to be less effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical tretinoin</a>, when used as monotherapy. However, a synergistic effect has been observed when the two medications are combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Alpha hydroxy acids also diminish the signs of aging skin, and are marketed for use in antiaging skin care regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tea tree oil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tea tree oil is a product derived from the Australian Melaleuca alternifolia tree that possesses antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Two randomized controlled trials have investigated this agent for the management of acne vulgaris. In a 45-day trial of 60 patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris, patients treated with 5% tea tree oil exhibited a 44 percent reduction in total lesion counts, compared with a 12 percent reduction in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another trial comparing treatment with 5% tea tree oil or 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a> (n = 124), patients in both groups showed a significant reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions, but a slower onset of action occurred with tea tree oil therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LIGHT/LASER THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinician-administered light sources are used for the treatment of acne, though well-designed clinical trials supporting the benefit of these treatments are limited, and there is uncertainty about the efficacy of these interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Examples of light-based therapies include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broad-spectrum continuous-wave visible light sources (blue light, red light)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intense pulsed light</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser sources including the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, pulsed dye laser (PDL), and infrared lasers </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photodynamic therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photopneumatic technology</p><p/><p>Photodynamic therapy involves the application of a photosensitizing agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminolevulinic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminolevulinic acid</a> (ALA) or methyl aminolevulinic acid (MAL) prior to exposure to blue or red light, lasers, pulsed light sources, or nonpulsed broad spectrum light. It is hypothesized that once applied to the skin, ALA and MAL are preferentially taken up by the pilosebaceous unit and augment the response to light therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Additional topical photosensitizers that have been less extensively studied in photodynamic therapy for acne include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> and indole-3-acetic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Photopneumatic technology is a newer therapeutic modality. It has been less extensively studied for the treatment of acne than other light treatments. Photopneumatic devices combine gentle negative pressure with broadband pulsed light (400 to 1200 nm). The suction pressure helps to open follicular ostia through the evacuation of sebum and brings pilosebaceous units closer to the treatment tip. The broadband light exerts antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms of action for light-based therapies in the treatment of acne are not completely understood. Proposed theories regarding the mechanisms through which these modalities work include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blue and red light therapy for acne are thought to work via the absorption of light by porphyrins produced by <em>C. acnes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The porphyrins absorb light wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, and absorb most effectively at wavelengths around 410 nm, which is within the absorption spectrum of blue light. As a result of light exposure, the porphyrins become activated, leading to the production of free oxygen radicals and bacterial death. Red light activates porphyrins less intensely than blue light, but penetrates more deeply into the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infrared lasers (1320 nm, 1450 nm), radiofrequency devices, and photodynamic therapy are thought to inflict thermal damage to sebaceous glands and decrease sebum production.

Common ingredients in nonprescription products include salicylic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a>, sulfur, and alpha hydroxy acids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild to moderate acne who do not want to initiate prescription medications, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> salicylic acid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with inflammatory lesions, benzoyl peroxide is preferred due to the drug's antimicrobial properties. Combination therapy with both drugs may lead to additional benefit. Patients with mild to moderate acne who do not respond to nonprescription products after three months of treatment should be clinically evaluated. Patients with more severe acne should be evaluated earlier, to consider use of more effective treatments to prevent or minimize irreversible scarring. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Other topical medications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of laser and other light-based therapies in the treatment of acne is not clearly defined. We suggest that light-based therapies should not be used as first-line treatment for acne vulgaris (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). These therapies may be utilized as an adjunct to medical acne therapy or as an option for patients who decline medical therapy although further studies are necessary to clarify their role. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Light/laser therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with primarily comedonal acne who desire an accelerated treatment response, we suggest superficial chemical peels (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, peels should be avoided in patients taking oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> and should be used with caution in patients with dark skin pigmentation. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Office-based superficial chemical peels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Until further evidence is available, we suggest not using microdermabrasion for the treatment of acne (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, this procedure may be useful as a pretreatment for photodynamic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Microdermabrasion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest intralesional glucocorticoids for selected nodular inflammatory acne lesions in order to accelerate their resolution (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
