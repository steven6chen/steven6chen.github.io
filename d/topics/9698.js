These branches arise at acute angles from the large arteries of the circle of Willis, stem of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), or the basilar artery. Although this definition implies that pathological confirmation is necessary, diagnosis in vivo may be made in the setting of appropriate clinical syndromes and radiological tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dechambre first used the term &quot;lacune&quot; in 1838 to describe softenings in subcortical regions of the brain found on autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At the time, there was dispute regarding whether these lacunes were caused by encephalitis, a late phase of a small hemorrhage, or ischemic necrosis. Marie in 1901 first described a clinical syndrome associated with multiple lacunes, characterized by sudden hemiplegia with good recovery, a characteristic gait with small steps (&quot;marche a petits pas de Dejerine&quot;), pseudobulbar palsy, and dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the 1960s, careful clinicopathological correlations by Fisher generated the so-called &quot;lacunar hypothesis,&quot; which suggested that lacunes are due to a chronic vasculopathy related to systemic hypertension, cause a variety of defined clinical syndromes, and imply a generally good prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The introduction of CT and MRI has generated data that both supports and opposes the lacunar theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Some authors have suggested abandoning the concept altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Detractors of the lacunar hypothesis note the lack of animal data or an animal model of lacunar infarction and the demonstration of embolic sources from the heart, aorta, or large arteries in a substantial percentage of lacunar strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Proponents concede that some small number of lacunes may result from emboli, but they point out that the proportion of embolic sources found in association with lacunar syndromes is far lower than for other ischemic stroke types and that there are clear clinical and epidemiologic reasons to separate lacunes from other ischemic stroke subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>One of the major difficulties in interpreting these data stems from the inability of imaging techniques to show that an infarct was due to occlusion of a single penetrating artery. Furthermore, various studies have used different sets of criteria to define &quot;lacunar infarcts&quot; and the many lacunar syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, continuing publications on the subject have demonstrated that the term &quot;lacune&quot; is clinically useful and has gained wide acceptance in the literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most lacunes occur in the basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, caudate), subcortical white matter (internal capsule and corona radiata), and pons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,15</a>]. These locations correspond to vascular territories of the lenticulostriate branches from the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, the recurrent artery of Heubner from the anterior cerebral artery, the anterior choroidal artery from the distal internal carotid artery, thalamoperforant branches from the posterior cerebral artery, and paramedian branches from the basilar artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73027 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. These small branches originate directly from large arteries, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of hypertension, probably explaining this peculiar distribution.</p><p>A study using fluorescent and radiopaque dye injection techniques has demonstrated that penetrating vessels supply distinct microvascular territories of the basal ganglia, with minimal overlap and sparse anastomoses between the penetrating vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The ultimately terminal rather than anastomotic nature of these vessels is another factor explaining the predisposition of this region to lacunar infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several mechanisms for small vessel disease and lacunar infarction have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/1,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipohyalinosis of the penetrating arteries is considered the usual cause, particularly of smaller infarcts (3 to 7 mm in length).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microatheroma of the origin of the penetrating arteries coming off the middle cerebral artery stem, circle of Willis, or distal basilar or vertebral arteries. This mechanism has been proven pathologically by serial section for the basilar artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, not proven pathologically, tiny emboli have been suspected as the cause of these small infarcts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of the cerebral arteriolar and capillary endothelium and the associated blood-brain barrier. &#160;</p><p/><p>The first two mechanisms are proven pathologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and generally regarded as a consequence of systemic hypertension. In a retrospective study, lacunar infarcts in the territory of a single perforating branch artery of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were found significantly more often in association with atherosclerotic MCA occlusive disease than with internal carotid occlusive disease or cardiac embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This observation supports the hypothesis that some lacunar strokes are caused by parent artery (eg, MCA or basilar artery) atheroma that occludes the origin of the penetrating artery.</p><p>The third mechanism (embolism) is supported both experimentally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and by case reports of lacunes in patients with high-risk cardiac sources for emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] or following cardiac and arch angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Other mechanisms have been proposed to account for lacunar infarcts, but none are pathologically proven. One alternate explanation is that failure of the arteriolar and capillary endothelium and the blood-brain barrier leads to small vessel disease, lacunar stroke, and white matter lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/19,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24-27</a>]. This failure allows extravasation of blood components into the vessel wall, which results in perivascular edema and damage to the vessel wall, perivascular neurons, and glia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. However, one neuropathologic study found no compelling evidence of a specific cerebral endothelial response in patients with small vessel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The pathology of lacunar infarcts may be changing as the medical management of hypertension becomes more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A decline in the number of lacunes per patient in comparable pathology series has been attributed to the introduction of antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Another neuropathology study in lacunar infarcts found only 69 percent of patients with evidence of systemic hypertension and rare cases of classic lipohyalinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], further suggesting that modern antihypertensive therapy may have changed the natural history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathophysiology of lacunes. </p><p>Of interest regarding mechanism, a systematic review of 19 cohort studies involving 5864 patients with ischemic stroke found that those who had a lacunar infarct as the index event were more likely to have lacunar than nonlacunar stroke recurrence, lending some support to the notion that lacunar strokes represent a different form of arteriopathy than other ischemic stroke subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Studies investigating possible stroke mechanisms in lacunar infarcts have found carotid stenosis in 13 to 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>] and cardiac sources in 18 to 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>] of patients with a radiologically-demonstrated lacunes. These rates are much lower than those of patients with cortical infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>] and may be similar to asymptomatic elderly populations, making the argument of a causal relationship between the verified sources and the lacunes difficult to prove. It also appears that patients with lacunar infarcts more often have milder degrees of carotid stenosis than those with cortical infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. On the other hand, ipsilateral carotid stenosis appears to be more common than contralateral stenosis, which supports a possible causal relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In some reports, multiple acute to subacute subcortical or small cortical infarcts have been detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), suggesting an embolic source.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study using DWI in patients presenting with a lacunar syndrome found that 16 percent had multiple infarcts detected as DWI-hyperintense lesions, implying that all lesions were acute to subacute (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54402\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54402 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This subgroup more frequently harbored a proximal embolic source than patients with single lesions (p &lt;0.05).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another case series evaluated 73 patients presenting with lacunar syndromes; all underwent DWI as well as extensive neurovascular and cardiac evaluations for potential embolic sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. DWI radiologic patterns suggestive of nonlacunar infarction (mainly embolism) were seen in a total of 30 patients (41 percent); of these, 16 had one large or multiple acute lesions within a single vascular territory, and another 14 had multiple infarcts in different vascular territories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients with more than one infarct on DWI were significantly more likely to have a clinically proven embolic source, although no embolic source was found in nine patients with a DWI pattern suggestive of a <span class=\"nowrap\">nonlacunar/embolic</span> stroke mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence rate of lacunar infarcts depends upon the population studied:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study from Italy, the incidence rate of lacunar infarct standardized to the 1996 European population was 26.3 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Lacunes accounted for 15 percent of first-ever ischemic strokes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among a community-based population of predominantly white residents of Rochester, Minnesota, the incidence rate of lacunar infarct between 1985 and 1989 was 29 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Lacunes accounted for 16 percent of first-ever ischemic strokes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among a community-based population of black residents of a metropolitan area of Cincinnati, Ohio, the incidence rate of lacunar infarct was 52 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Lacunes accounted for 22 percent of first-ever ischemic strokes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among populations of patients in referral based studies, lacunes account for a larger proportion of ischemic strokes, 26 percent in the Stroke Data Bank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p>One group estimated that 18 percent of first ischemic strokes in the United States are lacunes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This compares with 16 percent due to large vessel atherosclerosis with stenosis, 26 percent cardioembolic, 3 percent due to an uncommon mechanism, and 37 percent of unknown or no obvious cause.</p><p>A population-based study from Japan suggests that the incidence of lacunar stroke has been steadily declining since the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This finding was attributed to improved control of hypertension and decreased prevalence of smoking during the last 40 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS AND ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, two of the three described mechanisms for lacunar stroke are related to a chronic vasculopathy associated with systemic hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Other likely risk factors for lacunar infarction include diabetes mellitus and possibly smoking, age, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and lacunar infarction in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-homocysteine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of homocysteine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension and diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are associated with an increased risk of stroke in general. Whether they are more commonly associated with lacunar stroke and small vessel disease compared with other stroke subtypes (as many believe) is not clear, since the evidence is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. The answer may depend upon the population studied and the criteria used to define lacunar-type infarction.</p><p>One explanation for the difference in lacunar stroke incidence rates between whites and blacks cited above (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above) is a higher incidence of risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension among blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In the community-based study of blacks in Cincinnati, Ohio, the odds ratios of first-ever lacunar infarct among patients with diabetes or hypertension were 4.4 and 5.0, respectively, compared with nondiabetic and normotensive individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The attributable risk (proportion of cases that can be attributed to the risk factor) for these two diseases were 30 and 68 percent, respectively (hypertension has a greater impact than diabetes because of its higher overall prevalence in the population). The rates of hypertension and current smoking were found to be significantly increased in patients with lacunar infarcts compared with other stroke subtypes.</p><p>Other studies have also found a difference in the incidence of risk factors between patients with lacunar stroke and those with other stroke subtypes. In the Stroke Data Bank, patients with lacunar stroke had fewer previous transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and strokes than those with large vessel atherosclerotic infarction and, compared with patients who had cardioembolic strokes, those with lacunar infarcts more frequently had hypertension and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>These findings contrast with some other community-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/42,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,52</a>]. As an example, in the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project, a study of first-ever stroke, comparison between the risk factor profiles of patients with lacunar infarction and carotid artery distribution infarct involving the cortex found that the two groups did not differ in the prevalence of prestroke hypertension or markers of sustained hypertension, or in the prevalence of other risk factors for ischemic stroke such as diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, cervical bruit, peripheral vascular disease, or cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Similarly, the Rochester, Minnesota study found no greater incidence of diabetes and hypertension among patients with lacunar infarcts and those with other stroke subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The APOE e4 allele may confer some risk of developing small vessel pathology, as there is evidence that amyloid beta peptide levels are associated with an increased risk for lacunar stroke in carriers of the APOE e4 allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and that APOE e4 carriers are at increased risk for the development of subcortical white matter lesions, if they are also hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These observations require further confirmation.</p><p>Additional genetic factors that may play a role in the development of small vessel disease and lacunar stroke include homozygosity for the T allele located at position -7351 within the enhancer region of the tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) gene (the <span class=\"nowrap\">T/C</span> enhancer polymorphism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and the D allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) <span class=\"nowrap\">insertion/deletion</span> genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Finally, several rare conditions are characterized by hereditary cerebral small vessel arteriopathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).

This disorder is known also by a variety of other names, including retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL), cerebroretinal vasculopathy, hereditary vascular retinopathy, and hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy nephropathy and stroke (HERNS). Manifestations include visual impairment and neurologic involvement with focal deficits, migraine, cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

As a general rule, lacunar syndromes lack findings such as aphasia, agnosia, neglect, apraxia, or hemianopsia (so-called &quot;cortical&quot; signs). Monoplegia, stupor, coma, loss of consciousness, and seizures also are typically absent.</p><p>Penetrating artery occlusions usually cause symptoms that develop over a short period of time, typically minutes to hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52246 \">figure 2</a>). However, a stuttering course may ensue, as with large artery thrombosis, and symptoms sometimes evolve over several days.

The exact vascular anatomy is debated. Theoretically, penetrating arteries from the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supply the thalamus and the internal capsule is supplied from the lenticulostriate branches of the MCA. Occlusion of a single penetrating artery involving both arterial territories is difficult to implicate; the site of vascular occlusion was not identified in the original case description [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome is the least common of all lacunar syndromes in most case series, accounting for 2 to 6 percent of lacunar syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/33,72,82,83,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,72,82,83,88</a>].

Cases such as these have become rare, even in patients with multiple subcortical infarcts, and questions have been raised about whether the patients in the original description had unrecognized normal-pressure hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The relationship between subcortical strokes and cognitive deficits has been explained by interruption of neural connections with an indirect effect upon cortical metabolism and perfusion, so-called &quot;diaschisis.&quot; This hypothesis is supported by case series of CT-demonstrated subcortical infarcts presenting with transcortical aphasia or neglect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>], as well as by functional studies using SPECT or positron emission tomography (PET) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>].</p><p>One study using PET compared cortical glucose metabolism in patients with dementia and subcortical infarcts, patients with subcortical strokes and normal cognitive function, and controls without cognitive impairment or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

As an example, a prospective MRI study of 1015 patients without baseline dementia found that silent subcortical infarcts were associated with later development of dementia over four years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Patients developing dementia more often had thalamic strokes at baseline and accumulated new subcortical lesions on a second MRI scan.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate a potential mechanism for dementia in subcortical strokes and the need to develop more effective strategies to prevent the accumulation of silent subcortical infarcts.

Thus, the diagnosis of lacunar infarction in vivo relies upon finding a clinical syndrome that is consistent with the location of a small noncortical infarct seen on CT or MRI. Brain imaging with CT or MRI is also useful to exclude other potentially life-threatening diagnoses such as intracerebral hemorrhage or subdural hematoma. Investigation of the underlying stroke mechanism (eg, thrombosis versus embolism) is still indicated to exclude potentially correctable causes of recurrence.</p><p>This section will primarily discuss the diagnostic tests used to confirm or exclude the clinical suspicion of a lacune (eg, CT, MRI, DWI). The evaluation of stroke mechanisms is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncontrast head CT is the initial imaging modality for most patients presenting with an acute stroke syndrome. CT has low sensitivity for detecting lacunes (30 to 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/14,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,98</a>]. The sensitivity of CT for lacunes in the hyperacute phase (&lt;6 hours) has not been systematically studied, but is likely to be even lower; thus, a lacune seen on CT in this time window is more frequently chronic and not related to the clinical symptoms. CT also is limited in identifying posterior fossa infarcts and in defining the degree of cortical extension in subcortical infarcts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI has been extensively studied in lacunar infarcts. It has a higher sensitivity and specificity than CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>], and is better for defining the exact anatomical localization. In one study, for example, MRI detected lacunar infarcts in 19 of 22 patients with compatible symptoms, compared with 11 found by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. A second report confirmed that MRI was superior to CT for detecting lacunes; the sensitivity of MRI was greatest for patients who presented with pure motor hemiparesis, detecting 85 percent of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. MRI usually shows infarcts within 8 hours of symptom onset.</p><p>An inherent difficulty of both CT and conventional MRI is the ability to differentiate between acute and chronic lesions. In one study, 16 percent of patients presenting with a lacunar syndrome had at least two lesions on conventional MRI that correlated with clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Furthermore, in patients presenting with a lacunar syndrome, multiple chronic subcortical lesions are not rare, occurring in approximately 42 to 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/4,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,98</a>]. For these reasons, knowledge of possible lesion locations based upon neurologic findings is necessary before implicating a particular lesion found on MRI as responsible for the clinical symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67341\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67341 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Diffusion-weighted imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a fast MRI technique that demonstrates a hyperintense signal whenever there is an area of restricted water diffusion, as occurs during acute ischemia. DWI has the advantages of a higher sensitivity for acute lesions than T2-weighted MRI or FLAIR, ability to differentiate between acute and chronic lacunar infarcts, and ability to identify multiple acute infarcts potentially linked to embolic sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/39,100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,100,101</a>].

This finding suggests that patients require DWI to define the clinically appropriate infarct when multiple subcortical infarcts of various ages are present.

On the other hand, more extensive investigation of potential embolic sources may be necessary in young patients with no cerebral risk factors and in patients with multiple lesions on DWI.</p><p>Vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) can be performed at the same time as brain imaging (CT or MRI) to exclude occlusion of the parent feeding artery, a condition that can mimic a lacunar infarct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/1,18,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,103</a>]. It is particularly important to perform intracranial vascular imaging in blacks and persons of Asian descent, since intracranial large artery occlusive disease is common in these populations. An alternative diagnostic test to exclude intracranial occlusive disease is transcranial Doppler (TCD), a technique that measures the blood flow velocities in the large intracranial arteries using an ultrasound probe placed over the orbit, temporal bone, and foramen magnum.

However, stroke subtype was classified mainly by clinical impression in the thrombolysis trials since vascular studies usually were not performed before treatment initiation. Thus, some patients with a large vessel or cardioembolic stroke mechanism (eg, those with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion, good leptomeningeal collaterals, and recanalization after thrombolysis) may have been incorrectly classified as having a small vessel etiology. Nonetheless, until better data are available, we recommend that patients with lacunar syndromes be selected for thrombolysis according to current guidelines in the same way as patients with other subtypes of ischemic stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 3</a>).

A 2015 meta-analysis identified two trials that evaluated antiplatelets versus placebo and reported outcomes in the subgroup of patients with lacunar stroke; in the pooled analysis, treatment with any single antiplatelet agent was associated with a significant reduction in ischemic stroke recurrence (relative risk 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

In addition, the risk of stroke recurrence is increased in the presence of cerebral microbleeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p>Patients with lacunar infarction and more severe initial motor deficits have worse functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lacunar-infarcts/abstract/104,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,111</a>]. What is not known is whether patients with a lacunar infarct due to embolism or large vessel atherosclerosis obstructing the ostium of a penetrator branch have a different prognosis and response to therapy. As long as this question remains, investigation of the operating stroke mechanism remains important.

These branches arise at acute angles from the large arteries of the circle of Willis, stem of the middle cerebral artery, and the basilar artery. Most lacunes occur in the basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, caudate), subcortical white matter (internal capsule and corona radiata), and pons. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Vascular anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several mechanisms for occlusion of small penetrator branches have been described (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lipohyalinosis of the penetrating arteries is the usual cause, particularly of smaller infarcts (3 to 7 mm in length).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Microatheroma of the origin of the penetrating arteries coming off the middle cerebral artery stem, circle of Willis, or distal basilar or vertebral arteries. This mechanism has been proven pathologically by serial section for the basilar artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In some cases, not proven pathologically, tiny emboli have been suspected as the cause of these small infarcts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacunes account for 15 to 26 percent of ischemic strokes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two of the three described mechanisms for lacunar stroke are related to a chronic vasculopathy associated with systemic hypertension. Other likely risk factors include diabetes mellitus and possibly smoking. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 20 lacunar syndromes have been described. Five have been validated as being highly predictive for the presence of lacunes radiologically (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pure motor hemiparesis (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pure motor hemiparesis'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pure sensory stroke (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pure sensory stroke'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ataxic hemiparesis (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Ataxic hemiparesis'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sensorimotor stroke (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Sensorimotor stroke'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>As a general rule, lacunar syndromes lack findings such as aphasia, agnosia, neglect, apraxia, or hemianopsia (so-called &quot;cortical&quot; signs). Monoplegia, stupor, coma, loss of consciousness, and seizures also are typically absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of lacunar infarction in vivo relies upon finding a clinical syndrome that is consistent with the location of a small noncortical infarct seen on CT or MRI. Brain imaging with CT or MRI is also useful to exclude other potentially life-threatening diagnoses such as intracerebral hemorrhage or subdural hematoma. Investigation of the underlying stroke mechanism (eg, thrombosis versus embolism) is still indicated to exclude potentially correctable causes of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or rt-PA) improves outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke in general if administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The available evidence suggests that intravenous thrombolysis is beneficial for patients with lacunar stroke. Most patients with acute ischemic stroke who are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacunar infarcts have a better short term prognosis than infarcts due to other stroke mechanisms, at least up to one year after onset.
