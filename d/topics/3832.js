Genetic defects <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrauterine insults such as impaired blood flow that alter endothelial development may play a role and result in disturbances in the elastic properties and narrowing of the aorta.

Thirty of the 351 (9 percent) relatives who were evaluated had asymptomatic LVOT obstruction structural heart defects that included abnormalities in the aortic arch (three), left ventricle (five), and aortic valve (21).

Most girls with Turner syndrome have additional associated clinical findings (eg, congenital lymphedema, webbed neck, growth failure, renal anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60006 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91041\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91041 \">picture 1</a>)); however, in girls with mosaicism, other clinical findings may be absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Up to 30 percent of patients with Turner syndrome have coarctation. Genetic testing for Turner syndrome (ie, karyotype analysis) should therefore be performed in female patients diagnosed with coarctation of the aorta.

The relative frequency of associated cardiac lesions differs somewhat based upon the age of the population studied.</p><p>In a large pediatric case series of 1892 patients from Boston Children's Hospital, approximately one-third of patients had other complex cardiac defects (including single ventricle variants [eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82280 \">figure 2</a>)], atrioventricular [AV] canal defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86346 \">figure 3</a>), or D-transposition of the great arteries [d-TGA] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68589 \">figure 4</a>)); 18 percent had a ventricular septal defect (VSD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the 806 patients who were classified as uncomplicated coarctation, other cardiac abnormalities included bicuspid aortic valve, atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral stenosis; only 17 percent of uncomplicated cases had no other cardiac problems.</p><p>In a case series of 216 infants (&lt;1 year old), 48 percent of patients were diagnosed with complex coarctation due to the presence of other cardiac defects including VSD, aortic and subaortic stenosis, AV canal defect, and d-TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The remaining 113 patients were diagnosed with simple coarctation; however, PDA occurred in 48 patients (42 percent). As a result, approximately one-third of affected infants did not have another detected cardiac anomaly. In this series, it is unclear whether an evaluation to detect the presence of bicuspid aortic valve was performed.</p><p>In a case series of 500 primarily adult patients evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, 17 percent had no additional cardiovascular anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In this cohort, bicuspid aortic valves, arch hypoplasia, VSD, and PDA were detected in 60, 14, 13, and 7 percent of patients, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1053215802\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coarctation of the aorta does not cause a hemodynamic problem in utero, as two-thirds of the combined cardiac output flows through the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) into the descending thoracic aorta, bypassing the site of constriction at the isthmus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>During the neonatal period, when the PDA and foramen ovale (between the right and left atria) begin to close, the cardiac output that must cross the narrowed aortic segment to reach the lower extremities steadily increases. With these changes the hemodynamic changes may range from mild systolic hypertension to severe heart failure depending upon the severity of the coarctation and upon the presence of other associated lesions.</p><p>At birth, the left ventricular afterload increases because of outflow tract obstruction resulting in increased systolic pressure in the left ventricle and proximal aorta. In cases of severe obstruction, the systolic pressure gradient may reach 50 to 60 mmHg at rest.</p><p>Several compensatory mechanisms arise to surmount the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. These include left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy, which maintains normal systolic function and ejection fraction, and the development of collateral blood flow involving the intercostal, internal mammary, and scapular vessels, which circumvents the stenotic lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, in neonates with severe lesions, heart failure may develop because there is insufficient time for the development of myocardial hypertrophy or collateral blood flow.</p><p>Other cardiac lesions may add further strain on ventricular function. Valvar and subvalvar aortic stenosis may further increase left ventricular systolic pressure and afterload, whereas a large ventricular septal defect, PDA, or mitral regurgitation will increase left ventricular end-diastolic volume and preload, which subsequently leads to increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and to pulmonary artery hypertension. These patients with complex coarctation are likely to develop heart failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Manifestations according to age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of coarctation vary in different age groups.

On physical examination, a clinical diagnosis is made if there is an absent or delayed femoral pulse (when compared with the brachial pulse). A murmur may be associated with other cardiac defects, such as PDA, aortic stenosis, or ventricular septal defect (VSD). A systolic click may be heard due to a bicuspid aortic valve. Differential cyanosis is seen in a neonate with severe coarctation of the aorta, and with a large PDA with a right-to-left shunt into the descending thoracic aorta.</p><p>A neonate with severe coarctation may present with heart failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shock when the PDA closes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88511\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88511 \">image 1</a>). These patients are pale, irritable, diaphoretic, and dyspneic with absent femoral pulses and, often, hepatomegaly. The pulses may be poor in all four extremities. In the clinical setting of neonatal shock, important diagnoses to consider include severe coarctation, sepsis, and metabolic abnormalities.

With careful history taking, some patients will report chest pain, cold extremities, and claudication with physical exertion. However, these are often noted after the diagnosis of coarctation is made. Careful measurement of blood pressure and palpation of pulses in all four extremities suggest the clinical diagnosis with lower systolic blood pressure in the lower extremities compared with upper extremities and brachial or radial artery to femoral artery pulse delay. In young children, coarctation of the aorta may present with hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> murmurs resulting from collaterals or associated heart defects.

Despite the variability in blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities, regional blood flow is generally maintained within normal limits by autoregulatory vasoconstriction in the hypertensive areas and by vasodilation in the hypotensive areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most patients are asymptomatic unless severe hypertension is present, which may lead to headache, epistaxis, heart failure, or aortic dissection.

(See <a href=\"#H366476975\" class=\"local\">'Intracranial aneurysms'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unruptured intracranial aneurysms&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing for Turner syndrome (ie, karyotype analysis) should be performed in all girls diagnosed with coarctation because of the high rate of association (approximately 5 to 15 percent of female patients) and because clinical findings suggestive of Turner syndrome may be absent in girls with mosaicism. (See <a href=\"#H366477137\" class=\"local\">'Turner syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiographic findings vary with age and severity of the coarctation. In infants with heart failure, the chest radiograph usually shows generalized cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings due to pulmonary venous congestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88511\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88511 \">image 1</a>). In older children and adults, the heart size may remain normal, but other findings include rib notching and the &quot;3&quot; sign (indentation of the aortic wall at the site of coarctation with pre- and post-coarctation dilatation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87707\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87707 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87857\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87857 \">image 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1088179450\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of coarctation is challenging as it is difficult to detect aortic narrowing because only 10 percent of the fetal cardiac output flows through the thoracic aorta. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of coarctation is generally confirmed by two-dimensional and Doppler transthoracic echocardiography. In adolescents, adults, and some pediatric cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88837\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88837 \">image 6</a>) is used as a complementary diagnostic tool. MRI or CT define the location and length of obstruction and identify collateral vessels and other associated lesions such as aortic dilatation.
