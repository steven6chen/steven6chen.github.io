Depending upon the type of photosensitivity disease, the abnormal response can manifest as macular erythema, papules, plaques, vesicles, bullae, telangiectasias, or eczematous patches. For some photosensitivity diseases, the rash may result in scarring. One of the key features in establishing the diagnosis of a photosensitive eruption is its distribution. In most instances, it occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin; the face, ears, dorsal forearms, &quot;V&quot;-area of the neck, and upper chest are commonly affected sites. However, occasionally it can occur on covered areas of the body, especially in individuals who use tanning beds.</p><p>The principles of photobiology, evaluation of the photosensitive patient, and general recommendations for photoprotection in the photosensitive patient will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of specific photosensitivity conditions and sunburn are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymorphous-light-eruption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polymorphous light eruption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sunburn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHOTOBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) emitted from the sun is divided into three wavelength ranges: ultraviolet A (UVA, 320 to 400 nm), ultraviolet B (UVB, 290 to 320 nm), and ultraviolet C (UVC, 200 to 290 nm). UVC is absorbed by the ozone layer in the atmosphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because of this, UVC does not reach the earth's surface and usually does not play a role in inducing photosensitivity. However, it is emitted by germicidal lamps and welding arcs and has been rarely reported to provoke photosensitivity in individuals with occupational exposure. UVA and some UVB penetrate the atmosphere and reach the earth's surface.</p><p>Patients with photosensitivity may react to UVA, UVB, or visible light (400 to 760 nm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045 \">figure 1</a>). Longer wavelengths penetrate deeper into the skin. UVA passes through the epidermis and into the dermis, whereas UVB enters into the epidermis, but little reaches the dermis. UVR has multiple effects on the skin. Notably, UVR causes DNA damage and mutations, which are initiating events in skin carcinogenesis. UV-induced immunosuppression may also contribute to the development of skin cancers by interfering with the ability of the immune system to identify and eliminate neoplastic cells before they become clinically apparent skin cancers. A further effect of UVR is the generation of reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen, superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. The generation of reactive oxygen species leads, among other things, to lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and activation of signal transduction pathways. These effects have been implicated in the pathogenesis of skin cancer, photoaging, and inflammatory responses in photosensitivity disorders. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH PHOTOSENSITIVITY DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photosensitivity disorders of the skin are conditions in which an abnormal cutaneous response occurs after exposure to ultraviolet radiation or visible light. The major categories include idiopathic photodermatoses, photodermatoses due to exogenous or endogenous agents, photoexacerbated dermatoses, and photosensitive genodermatoses.</p><p>A table describing the clinical and diagnostic findings of many of the disorders is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57800 \">table 1</a>).

A report of childhood onset may suggest diagnoses such as hydroa vacciniforme, actinic prurigo, or erythropoietic protoporphyria. In contrast, chronic actinic dermatitis typically occurs in adults and in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>A complaint of painful skin with sun exposure may suggest a diagnosis of erythropoietic protoporphyria instead of other photodermatoses that are characteristically pruritic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital erythropoietic porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transient hive-like lesions appearing within minutes of sun exposure suggest solar urticaria rather than polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). PMLE typically appears hours to days after sun exposure, most commonly as papules and papulovesicles, and persists for days.</p><p>A history of reaction to sunlight passing through window glass indicates an ultraviolet A (UVA)-sensitive photodermatosis, because ultraviolet B (UVB), unlike UVA, does not penetrate through window glass. Patients often fail to distinguish between sun exposure and exposure to heat. Care must be taken to establish that UV, rather than heat, is responsible for provoking the disease. </p><p>Review of the patient's past and present medications is important in determining a drug-related cause. Details about outdoor activities, occupation, and recreation are helpful in distinguishing a true photosensitivity eruption from an airborne allergic contact dermatitis, irritant dermatitis, or arthropod bites. Lastly, a history of an underlying disease may bring a photoexacerbated disorder into the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Photoexacerbated dermatoses'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin examination should include both sun-exposed and unexposed areas. Photosensitive eruptions typically occur symmetrically on the face, ears, &quot;V&quot; area on the neck and chest, and extensor forearms. Sparing of the relatively shaded area of the upper lip, submental neck, upper eyelids, nasolabial folds, and post-auricular areas may be clues for a photosensitive eruption.</p><p>Assessment of the type of lesions (eg, urticaria, papules, or vesicles) is essential.

Laboratory evaluation may include ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro (SSA), anti-La (SSB) titers and porphyrin studies when lupus erythematosus or porphyria is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Even in circumstances in which the skin biopsy is non-diagnostic, histology may be helpful in ruling out other diseases included in the differential diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Phototesting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phototesting, if available, can be used to determine a patient's minimal erythema dose (MED). The MED is the lowest dose of ultraviolet radiation delivered to the skin that induces erythema 24 hours after exposure. MED testing is conducted for both UVA and UVB, employing separate light sources.</p><p>The MED can be helpful as a diagnostic tool. MEDs in patients with certain photodermatoses are lower than those in normal controls. Phototesting can also help to determine the wavelengths causing a photodermatosis (UVA, UVB, or visible light). A summary of the results of phototesting in photosensitivity disorders is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57800 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>For phototesting, an opaque template with multiple openings and the appropriate light sources are used to irradiate separate areas of skin with progressively increasing doses of UVA, UVB, or, in some instances, visible light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An uninvolved site, typically the back or inner aspect of the forearm, is used as the test area. The lowest dose of radiation that provides uniform erythema over the irradiated site at 24 hours is the MED.</p><p>In patients with solar urticaria, the minimal urticarial dose (MUD) is evaluated by administering increasing doses of UVA, UVB, or visible light and assessing the occurrence of urticarial lesions at the site of irradiation within the first hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>In addition to basic phototesting to determine the MED, provocation phototesting may be performed in an attempt to induce lesions. Provocation phototesting is primarily used for suspected PMLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and has also been employed to diagnose photosensitive cutaneous lupus and hydroa vacciniforme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The best results for PMLE are obtained when the tested site is in a location of previously affected skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Radiation doses that approximate the MED typically are administered repeatedly over three to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The tested area is subsequently examined for occurrence of lesions. Skin biopsy and histologic examination may be required to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>Prior to phototesting, patients must discontinue glucocorticoids and other systemic immunosuppressants for at least two weeks and antihistamines for at least one to two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The site is covered again, and 24 hours later, both the irradiated and control test sites are examined for reactions. A reaction to a specific photoallergen in the irradiated site, but not the control site, indicates a photoallergy.

Patients with more severe cases of photosensitivity may not respond to sun protection alone and will likely require other treatment modalities, depending on their specific diagnosis.

The large particle size of these ingredients makes them opaque and enables them to block some visible light, but may make them cosmetically unacceptable to patients. As a result, non-opaque, micronized formulations of titanium and zinc oxide have been developed.
