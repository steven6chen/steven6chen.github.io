It is an X-linked inborn error of the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway. This results in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) within lysosomes in a wide variety of cells, thereby leading to the protean manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>There is no cure for Fabry disease. Recombinant alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A), the enzyme that is deficient in patients with Fabry disease, and migalastat hydrochloride, an oral pharmacological chaperone that facilitates trafficking of alpha-Gal A to lysosomes, are therapeutic options for eligible individuals. The impact of these therapies on mortality is unknown. </p><p>The treatment and prognosis of Fabry disease is presented here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of cardiac disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Neurologic manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18650162\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of patients with Fabry disease primarily focuses upon replacing the missing or deficient enzyme (alpha-galactosidase A, or alpha-Gal A). All classically affected males (ie, with very low or undetectable levels of alpha-Gal A) should receive enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) as soon as the diagnosis is made, regardless of whether or not clinical manifestations are present. Female carriers and atypically affected males (ie, with marginal levels of alpha-Gal A) should receive ERT if clinical manifestations (eg, renal, neurologic, cardiovascular) are present. We also treat patients who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with enzyme replacement, as this may reduce cardiovascular and neurologic complications of Fabry disease. Although new approaches are being developed, their role in the treatment of Fabry disease is much less well defined. (See <a href=\"#H2889283786\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to ERT'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who develop chronic kidney disease should receive the same monitoring and care as a patient with chronic kidney disease due to a different etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As part of this routine care, we usually treat hypertensive patients who have Fabry disease with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Antihypertensive therapy with a RAS inhibitor'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF ERT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) consists of providing affected patients with the deficient enzyme, alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A). Two formulations of recombinant human alpha-Gal A have been developed: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> (Replagal, developed by Transkaryotic Therapies, Cambridge, MA), produced in a genetically engineered human cell line; and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> (Fabrazyme, developed by Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The two agents appear to be equally efficacious, although they have not been directly compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>There are no studies that definitively guide timing of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and duration of therapy once started for either symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. </p><p>Treatment is expensive. In 2005, for example, the estimated retail cost of therapy with Fabrazyme for one year was $160,000 in Europe and $206,000 in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Whom to treat with ERT and when to begin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uniform recommendations for the use of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) do not exist. Our recommendations for ERT differ depending upon whether the patient is a classically affected male (ie, with very low or undetectable levels of alpha-galactosidase A [alpha-Gal A]) or a female or a male with an atypical presentation (ie, with marginal levels of alpha-Gal A). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1446782\"><span class=\"h3\">Classically affected males</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the data presented above, we treat all hemizygous males with low or undetectable levels of alpha-Gal A with ERT, whether or not clinical features of Fabry disease are present, and begin therapy as soon as possible after the diagnosis is established. The clinical features and the diagnosis of Fabry disease are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The following observations support the view to initiate &quot;prophylactic&quot; therapy in asymptomatic hemizygous males with the classic form of Fabry disease (ie, those with very low or undetectable levels of alpha-Gal A) (see <a href=\"#H1003157369\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy studies'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive renal disease ultimately develops among all or almost all patients with the classic form of Fabry disease. Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation in podocytes begins in childhood and progresses with increasing age. Gb3 accumulation leads first to pathologic abnormalities, such as increasing podocyte foot process width, and subsequently to clinical manifestations, such as proteinuria and reduced glomerular filtration rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme replacement is associated with a nonsignificant trend toward clinical benefit, with benefits largely observed in those with preserved renal function at the time ERT is initiated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits of ERT on renal function appear to be limited in patients who already have significant renal impairment when therapy is initiated. The decline in renal function does not always slow and usually does not arrest. This clinical finding is consistent with the pathological observation that ERT does not fully clear Gb3 deposits from podocytes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERT may reduce the incidence of severe clinical events (eg, renal failure, cardiac events, stroke, death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a study of 1044 adult patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> for up to five years, the incidence of severe clinical events was 111 per 1000 person-years during the first six months of ERT. After six months, the incidence decreased to 40 to 58 events per 1000 person-years and remained stable within this range.</p><p/><p>Thus, we suggest the initiation of ERT in hemizygous males with the classic form of the disease as soon as possible after the diagnosis is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Our suggestion differs slightly from that made by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Based upon the reduced benefit from ERT in patients with established renal disease mentioned above, the ERBP suggest that ERT not be initiated in previously untreated patients with proteinuria (greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> or reduced glomerular filtration rate (less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) unless the patient has other symptoms or signs of Fabry disease that warrant treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1368618298\"><span class=\"h3\">Females and males with atypical disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat female carriers and atypically affected males with ERT if clinical manifestations of Fabry disease (eg, renal, neurologic, cardiovascular) are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, we perform a kidney biopsy in such patients and, even if asymptomatic, will treat with ERT if significant Gb3 accumulation is observed.</p><p>There are several reasons why we do not uniformly treat all asymptomatic females and atypically affected males:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no rigorous data demonstrating benefit of empiric treatment of such individuals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all such individuals with deficient circulating alpha-Gal A activity develop manifestations of the disease; therefore, treatment would be unnecessary</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no noninvasive biomarkers that reliably predict the risk of serious renal end-organ damage in asymptomatic females with Fabry disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a large cost and burden associated with therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504387\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients requiring renal replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require dialysis or kidney transplantation before they are diagnosed with Fabry disease or before ERT is initiated. Such patients should probably receive ERT since they are at high risk for cardiac and cerebrovascular complications. </p><p>Although data are limited, patients on dialysis appear to derive cardiovascular and neurologic benefits from ERT, as noted above. (See <a href=\"#H4274411173\" class=\"local\">'Studies in patients with end-stage renal disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Although recurrence of Fabry disease in a renal allograft might not be expected because cells of the graft have normal alpha-galactosidase A activity, Gb3 accumulation of uncertain functional significance can be seen in renal allograft endothelial cells some years after kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These cells are probably of recipient origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and Gb3 deposits should be cleared by ERT. As with patients on dialysis, ERT may have cardiovascular and neurologic benefits in patients who have received a kidney transplant. (See <a href=\"#H4274411173\" class=\"local\">'Studies in patients with end-stage renal disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing of ERT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enzyme replacement doses are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Agalsidase alfa</a> (Replagal) &ndash; 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> as an intravenous infusion every two weeks </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Agalsidase beta</a> (Fabrazyme) &ndash; 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for as an intravenous infusion every two weeks</p><p/><p>Therapy is continued at these doses, if possible, for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gb3 clearance, once achieved, may not be maintained in patients who are switched to a lower dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one study, for example, standard-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> for six months cleared Gb3 from the kidney endothelium and skin of 21 Fabry patients. A lower dose (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks) was then administered during the subsequent 18 months. Kidney endothelial and skin clearance was maintained in only 70 to 90 percent of patients, suggesting that the lower dose may not be adequate in all patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance of Gb3 from podocytes may correlate with the cumulative dose of agalsidase in patients who initiate therapy with enzyme replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In one study of 20 Fabry patients (median age 21 years), both lower (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> or beta 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks) and higher doses (agalsidase alfa 0.2 or 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> 0.5 or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> ever two weeks) of agalsidase significantly reduced podocyte Gb3 over a mean of 9.4 years; however, the clearance of podocyte Gb3 was found to increase with higher cumulative agalsidase dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, patients in the higher-dose group experienced a significant reduction of kidney <span class=\"nowrap\">arterial/arteriolar</span> intimal Gb3 inclusions compared with baseline, which was not observed in the lower-dose group. However, the demonstration that cumulative versus actual agalsidase dose level is the key treatment variable in these studies is incomplete; it is not clear that 25 years of agalsidase 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks is equivalent to five years of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks. Additionally, albuminuria did not change significantly in either treatment group, and there was no significant difference in the rate of renal function decline between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to a shortage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> in 2009, 67 of 105 stable patients receiving 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks either switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> (38 patients) or else had their agalsidase beta dose reduced to 0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks (29 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. After one year, both lower-dose ERT groups developed significantly more frequent and more severe pain attacks. There was also a greater increase in albuminuria in the group switched to agalsidase alfa, and a faster decline in kidney function in the group with reduced agalsidase beta dose, as compared with those who remained on higher doses of agalsidase beta. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among young patients with Fabry disease, switching from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> resulted in reaccumulation of Gb3 within podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Repeat skin biopsies demonstrated complete clearance of Gb3 from endothelial cells. The relative resistance of podocytes to ERT may be partly attributed to the semi-quantitative method used to assess Gb3 deposition, which may not be as sensitive as morphometric quantitative techniques at detecting a reduction in Gb3 within podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>After 10 years, data were available for 52 of the 58 patients (50 men, 2 women) originally enrolled in the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Baseline information was not given about those treated and not treated with RAS inhibitors, and it is possible that RAS inhibitors appeared ineffective because the patients who received them had more advanced renal disease at the start. On the other hand, ERT may mitigate the beneficial effects of RAS inhibitors by directly inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p>Treating hypertensive patients with Fabry disease and nephropathy with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB may be a reasonable approach, provided hypotension and significant hyperkalemia can be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], but their superiority over other antihypertensive drugs in such patients is unproven.

Five-year graft survival (including death with a functioning allograft) was similar in patients with Fabry disease and those in the matched cohort. However, five-year patient survival was worse among patients with Fabry disease (81 versus 90 percent), while return to dialysis was less frequent in patients with Fabry disease (88 versus 80 percent). After adjusting for multiple factors, patients with Fabry disease had a 62 percent higher risk of death compared to recipients with other causes of ESRD.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The available data suggest that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a>) may reduce the severity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression of disease manifestations. Overall, ERT effectively reduces tissue deposition of Gb3 in the heart, skin, and in most cell types in the kidneys (with the notable exception that ERT clears deposits only minimally from podocytes and modestly from vascular smooth muscle).

Patients with cardiac involvement should have an electrocardiogram every 6 to 12 months. In addition, such patients should have an annual echocardiogram during the first two to three years of therapy, repeated thereafter as clinically indicated.

In addition, we offer standard care for complications of chronic kidney disease, and, when required, dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transplantation. As with other causes of ESRD, survival with transplantation is superior to that observed with dialysis. Thus, transplantation should be the treatment of choice for ESRD due to Fabry disease. The short-term and long-term results of kidney transplantation for Fabry disease are comparable to transplantation for other causes of ESRD.
