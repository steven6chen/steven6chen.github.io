Some aspiration occurs in normal individuals, especially when the airway protective mechanisms are stressed, such as while talking, laughing, eating, or sleeping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In most instances, an inconsequential amount of material is aspirated. In contrast, children with swallowing dysfunction are at risk for pathologic aspiration. The amount of aspiration that results in airway inflammation is variable and the risks are unknown. Pathologic aspiration may result in acute or chronic pulmonary disease, and impaired nutritional intake may lead to failure to thrive.</p><p>Swallowing dysfunction leading to aspiration presents major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that often require the efforts of a coordinated multidisciplinary team consisting of the patient's primary caregiver, health care providers with expertise in swallowing (speech and occupational therapists), and selected pediatric subspecialists (pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, otolaryngologist, neurologist, and developmental pediatricians). Aerodigestive programs specializing in patients with swallowing problems are becoming common at large pediatric centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367105375\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVELOPMENT OF FEEDING AND SWALLOWING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of swallowing matures during infancy, beginning with suckling movements in utero and progressing to the development of chewing during early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Recognition of these developmental states is important in the evaluation of swallowing disorders.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suckling, the earliest form of sucking, begins in utero with suckling and swallowing of amniotic fluid. It is characterized by a primitive anterior to posterior movement of the tongue. In premature infants, disordered patterns of suckling with bursts and pauses can persist through 32 to 34 weeks gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After this time, sucking becomes more rhythmic and organized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At three to four months of age, lateral tongue movements allow some bolus formation. By six months, children can eat pureed foods from a spoon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to drink from a cup requires both sucking and swallowing, and is usually established by 12 months of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deglutition, the ability to produce a bolus and propel the food to the esophagus, continues to improve through 24 months of age. Deglutition is typically divided into four phases: oral preparatory, oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The oral preparatory and oral phases are the first two phases of swallowing and are considered voluntary stages of swallowing. They include receiving the food, forming the bolus, and transporting it posteriorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The pharyngeal phase, also known as &quot;reflex swallow,&quot; utilizes complex and coordinated muscle activity. During this phase, contraction of the pharyngeal musculature propels the bolus downwards. The larynx elevates and closes at the level of the epiglottis, mainly by closure of the aryepiglottic folds and vocal cords. The apnea reflex, cessation of inspiration during swallowing, prevents laryngeal penetration and aspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The esophageal phase begins with the relaxation of the cricopharyngeal sphincter, which allows the bolus to pass through the esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367105383\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF SWALLOWING DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of anatomical and functional disorders may predispose to swallowing abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96548 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Recurrent and chronic stridor (which may be due to associated laryngomalacia), or croup-like symptoms may be present in some cases. Feeding difficulties may cause inadequate caloric intake and lead to failure to thrive. </p><p>In any age group, the sound of &quot;wet breathing&quot; or &quot;rattling&quot; can be a symptom of laryngeal penetration. Repeated aspiration may lead to recurrent wheezing, hoarseness of the voice, and recurrent pneumonias, particularly in the dependent parts of the lungs. </p><p>Coughing during feeding is a prominent symptom in most infants and children who aspirate food into the tracheobronchial tree. However, the cough reflex may become blunted with repeated aspiration. When aspiration without coughing or other symptoms occurs on a radiographic or functional evaluation, it is called silent aspiration. Silent aspiration is particularly common among children with delayed maturation or underlying neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>There is concern that aspiration can lead to abnormal lung function and long term airway injury, including bronchiectasis and fibrotic lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115018024\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of an infant or child with suspected swallowing dysfunction begins with a clinical assessment of feeding. This is usually followed by one or more tests to evaluate for swallowing problems including aspiration. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115018268\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment of feeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical assessment is usually conducted by a speech-language pathologist. This includes an examination of the face and oropharynx for anatomic abnormalities, observation and auscultation for respiratory distress, and assessment of the voice (eg, breathy quality or hoarseness suggests vocal cord paresis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The clinician then observes the child during feeding, under conditions that simulate the feeding environment and routine at home. The feeding should include thin and thick liquids, and solid foods of varied textures, if appropriate for the child's age and neurological development. Important findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motion of the mouth, tongue, and larynx during sucking, bolus formation, and swallowing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drooling or excessive accumulation of secretions in the mouth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough or &quot;wet&quot; upper airway noises after feeding, suggesting laryngeal penetration &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367105399\"><span class=\"h2\">Available diagnostic techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with suspected swallowing dysfunction should be further evaluated by a radiographic or endoscopic test of swallowing, regardless of whether symptoms of aspiration are noted during the clinical assessment of feeding. This is because some patients have clinically significant swallowing dysfunction or aspiration that is not apparent during the clinical assessment (eg, &quot;silent&quot; aspiration). In pediatric patients, the most common initial test is a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS); a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) may be useful as an alternative or supplementary examination in selected patients, as described below. </p><p>Other techniques have low diagnostic accuracy but may be used for supportive information in selected patients. These include scintigraphic techniques (gastric emptying scan or salivagram) and biomarkers such as lipid-laden macrophages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367105407\"><span class=\"h3\">Videofluoroscopic swallow study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The VFSS, also known as a modified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow (MBS), usually is the initial procedure for evaluating the pharyngeal and esophageal phases of deglutition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16-19</a>]. It should be performed after a clinical evaluation of swallowing by a speech-language pathologist, and the radiographic findings are interpreted in conjunction with the clinical findings. The procedure requires the presence and collaboration of a speech-language pathologist and radiologist in the fluoroscopy suite. Radiation exposure during this study, and potentially repeated studies, is a concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>To perform a VFSS, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> or other contrast medium is offered to patients orally, and swallowing is filmed from a lateral and anteroposterior view. The examination is focused on the oropharynx and proximal esophagus, and does not include views of the distal esophagus or stomach. A variety of food textures mixed with barium (thin liquid, thick liquid, purees, and solids as might be age appropriate) are commonly used to assess swallowing function. Since thin liquids are not the only substances aspirated, varying textures of contrast material are used during the VFSS to increase sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Multiple swallows are assessed because abnormalities may develop if the patient fatigues, particularly common in infants and those with weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Feeding can be continued without fluoroscopy to allow the infant to fatigue with resumption of fluoroscopy later to assess additional swallows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In order to get the best results, speech language pathologists work to make the patients and families comfortable. For children who have challenges participating in VFSS, practice sessions can often be scheduled in advance to decrease frustration at the time of the study. If the child has a nasogastric tube (NGT), it usually can be left in place; NGTs tend to slow several phases of swallowing but do not otherwise disturb swallowing function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>].</p><p>The VFSS is interpreted in real time by a speech-language pathologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiologist with special training in the technique. The examiner assesses the duration of oral and pharyngeal transit time, characterizes pharyngeal motility, and observes for signs of swallowing abnormalities including pooling of material in the vallecula and pyriform sinuses, residue in the pharyngeal recesses, and aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98057 \">figure 1</a>). Laryngeal penetration occurs when food or liquid extends below the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis.&nbsp;Deep laryngeal penetration occurs when food or liquid reaches the level of the vocal folds, and aspiration occurs when food or liquid extends below the vocal folds into the tracheobronchial tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The presence of contrast material in the tracheobronchial tree is diagnostic of aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96162\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96162 \">image 1</a>). However, lack of contrast material in the tracheobronchial tree does not exclude aspiration due to the intermittent and sporadic nature of aspiration. Thus, the specificity of this test for aspiration is high but its sensitivity is not.</p><p>Nasopharyngeal reflux (velopharyngeal incompetence), cricopharyngeal dysfunction, and laryngeal penetration are commonly observed abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51330\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51330 \">table 2</a>). The presence of any of these findings may be due to maturational process in young infants but is considered abnormal in children over one year of age; such findings indicate swallowing dysfunction but do not correlate well with aspiration. In older children and adults, there is good correlation between deep laryngeal penetration on VFSS and aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The frequency, nature, and severity of clinical symptoms must be taken into consideration while making treatment decisions based<strong> </strong>on the results of VFSS. Frequently, a recommendation for how to safely feed the patient can be made immediately after completion of the VFSS. (See <a href=\"#H115018398\" class=\"local\">'Feeding decisions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367105422\"><span class=\"h3\">Fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES) utilizes a fiberoptic laryngoscope positioned above the palate, through which an endoscopist can directly assess laryngeal elevation and closure during swallowing. In addition, adding color to the food bolus permits evaluation of residual pooling and aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96151\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef96151 \">movie 1</a>). </p><p>FEES is commonly employed in adults and correlates well with VFSS findings. Its use is increasing in children but has been limited due to its invasive nature, lack of widespread providers with experience in this technique, and lack of standardization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>].

Therefore, the sensitivity of this test for detecting clinically important aspiration appears to be low. A few studies report appearance of tracer in the esophagus instead of tracer in the lungs; these studies report up to 40 percent &quot;positive&quot; scans, but the correlation with clinical or other radiographic measures of aspiration is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Therefore, gastroesophageal scintigraphy has limited value for detecting clinically important aspiration and is infrequently used in clinical practice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivagram &ndash; This test is designed to detect aspiration during swallowing (antegrade aspiration). Among patients referred for evaluation of aspiration and swallowing, a high proportion have positive salivagrams (16 to 56 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]).

Among subjects with a positive salivagram, 90 percent had abnormalities on chest radiography, giving a strong clinical suspicion for aspiration. All of the remaining 10 percent of subjects with &quot;false positive&quot; results (positive salivagram but normal chest radiography) were younger than one year of age. In a separate study of neurodevelopmentally normal children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, salivagrams were more likely to be positive in infants (40 percent) as compared with children one to two years of age (16 percent) and older children (0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, there is some evidence that an abnormal salivagram is associated with clinical respiratory problems in referral populations, but the association may be weaker in infants and toddlers because of more false-positive results in this young age group. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367105438\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential biomarkers of aspiration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115017803\"><span class=\"h4\">Lipid-laden macrophages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) have been proposed as a marker of aspiration, but the reliability of this marker as a diagnostic tool is controversial, primarily due to its low specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The technique involves microscopic evaluation of the lipid content in the cytoplasm macrophages obtained by bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL), after staining for lipid using an &quot;oil red O&quot; or other stain for lipids. In some centers, the observation is transformed into a semi-quantitative score or &quot;LLM index.&quot;</p><p>Important limitations of using LLMs or the lipid index as a marker for aspiration include variability in the quality of the oil red O stain, lack of objective quantification of the amount of lipid in each macrophage, and interobserver variation. Furthermore, LLMs are not specific for aspiration because any source of lipid, whether endogenous or exogenous, will be scavenged by the alveolar macrophages and increase LLMs. Endogenous sources of lipid that will increase LLMs include fat embolism from long bone fractures, sickle cell disease with acute chest syndrome, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, graft versus host disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, and chemotherapy for malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nutritional support with intravenous fat emulsions may also cause an increase in lipid-laden macrophages. There is concern that chronic airway inflammation (eg, cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis from other causes) or parenchymal infections can also be a source of excess lipid rather than aspiration. Near complete or complete obstruction of an airway that might occur with a tumor (mostly in adults) or a longstanding retained foreign body will often result in lipid laden macrophages upstream from the obstruction; this is sometimes called an endogenous lipoid pneumonia. Aspiration of an oil, such as mineral or olive oil, is another source of elevated numbers of lipid-laden macrophages; this is sometimes called an exogenous lipoid pneumonia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115017815\"><span class=\"h4\">Other biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other biomarkers of aspiration have been studied, each of which is subject to concerns for sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, similar to the LLM index.

However, the presence of abnormal degrees of GER does not necessarily mean that the patient is aspirating the refluxate or that the GER is contributing to pulmonary disease. It is often helpful to consult with a pediatric gastroenterologist to perform and interpret tests to assess GER and gastrointestinal motility and to advise on management, especially prior to placement of a gastrostomy tube, to assist with decisions about concurrent fundoplication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Most patients with mild GER can be effectively managed without fundoplication, using dietary modification and positioning to reduce the frequency of GER, pharmacotherapy for acid suppression, and occasionally prokinetic agents.

It should be considered only in patients with GER that is strongly suspected to be contributing to pulmonary disease. When evaluating the severity of GER, a gastroenterologist classically focuses on the percent of time that gastric contents spend in the esophagus, which correlate with the risk for peptic esophagitis. From a pulmonary point of view, the number and duration of episodes may be less important than whether the reflux occurs during sleep, when the patient is horizontal and less likely to protect the larynx. Clinical judgment must be applied to individual patients when judging whether they are likely to benefit from fundoplication. Complications after fundoplication include retching, esophageal obstruction, intrathoracic herniation, and recurrence of GER due to breakdown of the wrap. Complications of fundoplication are most common in patients with neurologic impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Failure rates (variously defined) of antireflux surgery range from 2 to 50 percent and are generally higher in children with neurological impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

It is often reasonable to proceed with gastrostomy placement without fundoplication and to follow the patient clinically; fundoplication can be performed later if the patient has ongoing aspiration from refluxed food. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16156267\"><span class=\"h3\">Jejunal feeds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with GER who are dependent on enteral feeds, an alternate strategy to reduce GER and the associated risks of aspiration is to place the feeding tube in the jejunum rather than in the stomach; this tends to reduce but not eliminate GER. Disadvantages of jejunal feeds include intolerance of rapid feeding infusions (such that continuous rather than bolus feeds must be used), and a tendency for accidental displacement (except with permanent, surgically placed jejunal tubes). A retrospective study in a group of children with neurological impairment found that the rates of aspiration pneumonia and mortality were similar among those treated with jejunal feeding as compared with those treated with fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
