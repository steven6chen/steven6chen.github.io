In the United States, this problem accounts for approximately 10 percent of all ambulatory referrals to a gynecologist and is a common indication for diagnostic and therapeutic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is considered the principal indication for approximately 20 percent of hysterectomies performed for benign disease and at least 40 percent of gynecological laparoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The causes of CPP will be reviewed here. Evaluation and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of CPP ranges from 4 to 16 percent, but only about one-third of women with CPP seek medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Representative examples of surveys that have attempted to determine the prevalence of CPP in specific populations are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 635 women aged 20 to 50 years living in Seveso, Italy reported a prevalence of 4 percent for moderate to severe CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survey of patient records of 136 primary care practitioners in the United Kingdom also observed a 4 percent prevalence of CPP among 284,162 women aged 12 to 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence of CPP in this population was similar to that of migraine, back pain, and asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study in New Zealand designed to investigate the prevalence of CPP in women between the ages of 18 and 50 years noted that 25 percent of the 1160 women surveyed reported CPP over a three- month interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the Gallup organization performed a population-wide survey of women 18 to 50 years of age and found that of eligible women who agreed to participate, 15 percent reported they had experienced CPP within the past three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prevalence of pain sufficiently severe to miss work was 4 percent, similar to the prevalence reported in the Italian and United Kingdom studies. Characteristics of women with CPP in this study are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63830 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential causes of CPP are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112656 \">table 2</a>). The relative frequency of the various causes of CPP is significantly influenced by the local patient population, referral patterns, and specialty focus of the practice. In fact, one population-based study found that gastrointestinal and urologic problems were more common than gynecological conditions in women with CPP; gynecologic conditions accounted for approximately 20 percent of cases of CPP in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although any one disorder may be the cause of CPP, pain can also be the end result of several medical conditions, with each contributing to the generation of pain and requiring management. As an example, a woman may have endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, emotional stress, and pelvic floor pain related to muscular spasm. Women with more than one medical condition tend to have greater pain than women with only one disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In some women, no diagnosis other than chronic pain can be established; this is often a source of frustration for both the patient and clinician.</p><p>Common causes of CPP are discussed below by system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gynecologic</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometriosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometriosis is the most common diagnosis made at the time of gynecological laparoscopy for the evaluation of CPP. Overall, about one-third of women who undergo laparoscopy because of CPP are diagnosed with endometriosis; however, in practices specializing in the treatment of endometriosis, 70 percent or more of patients with CPP are given this diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic inflammatory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As many as 30 percent of women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) subsequently develop CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore, PID is a common cause of CPP in settings with a high prevalence of sexually transmitted disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two factors correlate with the likelihood of developing CPP after an episode of acute PID: (1) severity of adhesive disease and tubal damage (eg, hydrosalpinx) and (2) persistent pelvic tenderness 30 days after diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the underlying reason that PID often leads to CPP has not been clearly established. In one study of 780 predominantly black urban women with recently diagnosed PID, those most likely to develop CPP were smokers, women with a history of two or more episodes of PID, and women with a low composite mental health score on standardized tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between CPP and presence of adhesions is poorly defined. There is some evidence that dense adhesions that limit organ mobility cause visceral pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and evidence from conscious laparoscopic pain mapping that adhesions may account for pelvic pain in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic congestion syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic congestion syndrome is a controversial entity. It refers to a condition in which characteristic symptoms of shifting location of pain, deep dyspareunia, post-coital pain, and exacerbation of pain after prolonged standing are associated with radiological findings of pelvic varicosities (dilated uterine and ovarian veins) that display reduced blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One theory is that damage to the valves in the ovarian veins results in valvular incompetence leading to reflux and chronic dilation; however, incompetent and dilated pelvic veins are a common finding in asymptomatic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenomyosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal uterine bleeding and dysmenorrhea are the major symptoms of adenomyosis. Pain may be due to bleeding and swelling of endometrial islands confined by myometrium. Symptoms typically develop between the ages of 40 and 50 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-adenomyosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine adenomyosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Ovarian cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian cancer is not truly a &quot;silent killer.&quot; Most affected women have one or more nonspecific symptoms, such as lower abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/discomfort/pressure/bloating,</span> increased abdominal size, constipation, lack of <span class=\"nowrap\">appetite/nausea/indigestion,</span> irregular menstrual <span class=\"nowrap\">cycles/abnormal</span> vaginal bleeding, low back pain, fatigue, urinary frequency, or dyspareunia.

It should be distinguished from the residual ovary syndrome (ROS), in which the ovary was intentionally preserved and subsequently developed pathology. The typical patient presents with cyclic pelvic pain and a mass, although the pain may be persistent with acute flare-ups. Occasionally, an asymptomatic mass is detected on pelvic or sonographic examination. Ureteral obstruction may occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-remnant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian remnant syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Leiomyoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine leiomyomas may cause pressure symptoms. Acute pain occurs with degeneration, torsion, or expulsion through the cervix. Chronic pain is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

It is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder that causes pelvic pain and irritable bladder dysfunction with exaggerated urge to void and urinary frequency. Incontinence is not usually a symptom. The syndrome is often referred to as interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/painful</span> bladder syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/PBS),</span> reflecting the importance of bladder pain as a primary characteristic of the syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic suprapubic pain, especially in association with frequency, urgency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria suggests recurrent urinary tract infection. The possibility of a urethral diverticulum should be considered if there is a suburethral mass, fullness, or tenderness.

Neoplasia should be considered in women with hematuria, a history of smoking, or who are over 60 years of age.</p><p>Chronic urethral syndrome also presents with symptoms resembling those of interstitial cystitis, and many experts no longer recognize chronic urethral syndrome as a diagnosis distinct from interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/painful</span> bladder syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal tract</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Irritable bowel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, sometimes also called visceral hyperalgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]) is a gastrointestinal pain syndrome characterized by chronic or intermittent abdominal pain that is associated with bowel function, in the absence of any organic cause. Most patients with IBS also have bowel dysfunction. About 10 percent of the general population has symptoms compatible with IBS; women are diagnosed with IBS more than twice as often as men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>IBS is probably the most common diagnosis in primary care populations with CPP, occurring in up to 35 percent of these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]. However, in many women with CPP and IBS, the IBS has not been diagnosed or treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of IBS is based upon specific criteria in the patient's history; physical examination is generally unremarkable. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of IBS are discussed in detail separately.

It is a diagnosis of exclusion after anatomic, infectious, inflammatory, and metabolic causes of abdominal pain have been ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Specific functional abdominal pain disorders include functional dyspepsia, IBS, abdominal migraine, and functional abdominal pain syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammatory bowel disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue, diarrhea with crampy abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever, with or without gross bleeding, are the hallmarks of Crohn's disease. The transmural nature of the inflammatory process leads to fibrotic strictures that often lead to repeated episodes of small bowel or less commonly colonic obstruction. Ulcerative colitis, as well as other causes of colitis, have a similar presentation; however, rectal bleeding is more common with ulcerative colitis than with Crohn's disease.

The endoscopic and histologic features vary, ranging from mild inflammatory changes with submucosal hemorrhages (peridiverticular red spots on colonoscopy) to florid, chronic active inflammation resembling (histologically and endoscopically) inflammatory bowel disease. The pathogenesis is incompletely understood. The cause may be multifactorial, related to mucosal prolapse, fecal stasis, or localized ischemia.

In particular, the levator ani muscle group can undergo pain processes observed in other muscle groups, such as hypertonus, myalgia, overuse, and fatigue. The etiology includes any inflammatory painful disorder, childbirth, pelvic surgery, and trauma. In addition to dyspareunia, there may be aching pelvic pain, which is aggravated by sitting for prolonged periods, and relieved by heat and lying down with the hips flexed.</p><p>There is evidence that women with CPP have decreased thresholds to pain in the pelvic floor muscles, suggesting that pelvic floor tension myalgia may sometimes be a direct sequela of CPP due to other disorders, such as endometriosis or <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/PBS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Posture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Faulty posture can cause muscle imbalance involving the abdominal muscles, thoracolumbar fascia, lumbar extensors, or hip flexors and abductors leading to local or referred pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic abdominal wall pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pain emanating from the abdominal wall is frequently unrecognized or confused with visceral pain, often leading to extensive diagnostic testing before an accurate diagnosis is achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It may be related to muscular injury or strain (eg, rectus abdominis, pyramidalis, external obliques, transversus abdominus) or nerve injury (iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, pudendal). Pathology of these nerves can also result in pain referred to visceral organs. Chronic abdominal wall pain occurs in 7 to 9 percent of women after a Pfannenstiel incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Compression of the hyperirritable spot results in local as well as referred pain, sometimes accompanied by autonomic phenomena (piloerection, hyperhidrosis, vasodilation or vasoconstriction) and visceral symptoms (eg, diarrhea, vomiting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

It can be a complication of surgery (eg, urogynecologic procedures) or related to <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/childbirth,</span> athletic activities, trauma, or rheumatological disorders. The pain is aggravated by movements such as walking, stair climbing, and coughing. On examination, the pubis symphysis is tender to palpation.

Somatization may be the cause of CPP, other mental health disorders are more likely to represent comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatization is a syndrome of nonspecific physical symptoms, such as CPP, that are distressing and may not be fully explained by a known medical condition after appropriate investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Opiate dependency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients treated with opioids for chronic pain have a 3 to 7 percent risk of manifesting an addiction disorder. Additionally, patients with chronic pain have a decreased responsiveness to opioid analgesics, such that higher than normal doses are required for adequate analgesia. Because of these factors, the decision to treat women with CPP with opioids should be made only after a thorough evaluation, failure of other treatment modalities, and appropriate counseling of risks.

Past traumatic experiences may alter neuropsychological processing of pain signals and can permanently alter pituitary-adrenal and autonomic responses to stress.</p><p>In one study, women with a childhood history of sexual or physical abuse had a five-fold greater increase of adrenocorticotropic hormone to a standardized social stress intervention compared to women without a history of abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another series, 713 consecutive women seen in a referral-based pelvic pain clinic were given a questionnaire; 47 percent reported having either a sexual or physical abuse history and 31 percent had a positive screen for posttraumatic stress disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

It is not clear if depression and CPP are causally related. A few authorities believe that some cases of CPP are a variant of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], while others feel that stressful experiences, such as childhood sexual abuse, could cause both CPP and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Alternatively, depression might increase the risk that a stressful trauma, such as childhood sexual abuse, leads to CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Some women presenting with CPP have histories of primary psychiatric comorbidity. It is important to distinguish them from patients who are developing secondary psychological problems, that is, patients who are developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, or other expressions of psychopathology in reaction to their pain. Since nociceptive pathways are modulated by psychological processes, this mechanism probably plays an important role in amplifying pain symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of CPP ranges from 4 to 16 percent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential causes of CPP are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112656 \">table 2</a>). The relative frequency of the various causes of CPP is significantly influenced by the local patient population, referral patterns, and specialty focus of the practice. Although any one disorder may be the cause of CPP, pain can also be the end result of several medical conditions, with each contributing to the generation of pain and requiring management. Women with more than one medical condition tend to have greater pain than women with only one disorder. In some women, no diagnosis other than chronic pain can be established. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gastrointestinal and urinary tracts are the organ systems most often affected by disorders causing CPP.
