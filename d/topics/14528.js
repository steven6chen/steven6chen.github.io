Within that space, they undergo an acid catalyzed conversion to a reactive species, the thiophilic sulfonamides, which are permanent cations. The rate of conversion varies among the compounds and is inversely proportional to the pKa of the benzimidazole (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a> &gt;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> &gt;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72598\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72598 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The reactive species interacts with the external surface of the H-K-ATPase that faces the lumen of the secretory space of the parietal cell, resulting in disulfide bond formation with cysteine 813 located within the alpha-subunit of the enzyme; this is the residue that is intimately involved in hydrogen ion transport. This covalent inhibition of the enzyme results in a specific and long-lasting impairment of gastric acid secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gastric acid secretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong> &ndash; PPIs are similar in structure and mechanism of action, but PPIs differ in their pKa, bioavailability, peak plasma levels, and route of excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72598\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72598 \">table 1</a>). The magnitude of these differences are small and their clinical relevance has not been established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PPIs are most effective when the parietal cell is stimulated to secrete acid postprandially, a relationship that has important clinical implications for timing of administration. Because the amount of H-K-ATPase present in the parietal cell is greatest after a prolonged fast, PPIs should be administered before the first meal of the day. In most individuals, once-daily dosing is sufficient to produce the desired level of acid inhibition, and a second dose, which is occasionally necessary, should be administered before the evening meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H745155432\" class=\"local\">'Dose and timing of administration'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once-daily PPI dosing for five days inhibits maximal gastric acid output by approximately 66 percent. Since PPIs inhibit only activated enzyme present in the canalicular membrane, the reduction of gastric acid secretion after an initial dose will probably be suboptimal. As inactive enzyme is recruited into the secretory canaliculus, acid secretion will resume, albeit at a reduced level. After the second dose is given on the next day, more H-K-ATPase will have been recruited and subsequently inhibited, and after the third dose, additional recruitment and further acid inhibition will probably occur. Thus, the occasional use of a PPI taken on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis does not reliably provide adequate acid inhibition and does not produce a consistent or satisfactory clinical response (in contrast to the H2 antagonists, which have a more rapid onset of action) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Restoration of acid secretion after discontinuing PPIs depends upon enzyme turnover and the biological reversibility of the disulfide bond. Maximal acid secretory capacity may not be restored for 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1150172641\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing PPIs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolism</strong> &ndash; PPIs are metabolized via hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, with CYP2C19 having the dominant role. However, the dominance of CYP2C19 over other pathways varies significantly among the PPIs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72565\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72565 \">table 2</a>). The activity of CYP2C19 is also determined to some extent by genetic polymorphisms. Two inactivating mutations, which occur most commonly in Asian populations, have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Five percent of Caucasians and 12 to 23 percent of Asians are homozygous for <em>CYP2C19</em> mutations; as a result, the metabolism of PPIs by this route may be delayed in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Homozygotes for the wild type gene rapidly metabolize these drugs, while heterozygotes are intermediate metabolizers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Plasma levels of PPI correlate with their metabolism, and differences may contribute to varying dose requirements and clinical efficacy. As an example, one study examined the effect of variable metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> when using this agent to treat <em>H. pylori</em> in 62 Japanese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While eradication was achieved in all individuals homozygous for a <em>CYP2C19</em> mutation (ie, slow metabolizers), successful treatment was achieved in only 60 and 29 percent of heterozygotes and wild type homozygotes, respectively. In another study that evaluated the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> in the treatment of 65 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), slow metabolizers were much more likely to be asymptomatic as compared with heterozygotes and wild type homozygotes (85 versus 68 and 46 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The response rate in wild type homozygotes with severe GERD was only 16 percent. Wild type homozygotes (rapid metabolizers) also had the lowest plasma lansoprazole concentrations.

However, PPI metabolism via hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes may lead to specific drug interactions in some individuals. The presence of a <em>CYP2C19</em> gene mutation results in higher plasma PPI levels in homozygous individuals. However, if this metabolic pathway becomes saturated, the isoenzyme can become a major target for interactions with many drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53616 \">table 3</a>). CYP3A4-mediated metabolism may also be activated under such conditions and become the principal route of drug elimination. Furthermore, induction of CYP1A, another P450 isoenzyme, in CYP2C19 deficient or saturated individuals, can make them susceptible to interference with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> metabolism. The specific P450 enzymes involved in PPI metabolism and the potential for interactions among PPIs varies considerably (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72565\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72565 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>].</p><p>Some other important drug interactions with PPIs include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clopidogrel</a><strong> - </strong>Some data suggest decreased activation of clopidogrel when used in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> due to shared hepatic cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism.

PPI use has also been associated with an increased risk of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end-stage renal disease. However, further studies are needed to help better define an etiologic relationship between PPI use and the development and worsening of CKD. (See <a href=\"#H876746377\" class=\"local\">'Kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are conflicting data on the association between PPI use and risk of dementia and pneumonia. It is also unclear if PPI use is associated with an increased risk of death. It is possible that these associations are due to residual confounding and more studies are needed. (See <a href=\"#H876746377\" class=\"local\">'Kidney disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3416958771\" class=\"local\">'Dementia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3309582559\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wolfe MM, Sachs G.
