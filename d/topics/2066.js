If you have bipolar disorder, you may sometimes feel excessively elated, impulsive, irritable, or irrational (called mania) or hypomanic (a milder form of mania). Other times you may feel excessively sad (called major depression).</p><p>Bipolar disorder can make it hard to do a good job at work or school, have relationships with friends and family, and it even increases the risk of suicide if it is not treated or treated incorrectly. However, a number of effective treatment options are available.</p><p>For many reasons, it may take many years to diagnose bipolar disorder. As an example, a person may have multiple episodes of depression before an episode of hypomania or mania.</p><p>More detailed information about bipolar disorder is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Choosing pharmacotherapy for acute mania and hypomania&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Choosing maintenance treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults and lithium: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIPOLAR DISORDER CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact cause of bipolar disorder is not clear. The problem may be related to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. These chemicals allow cells to communicate with each other and play an essential role in all brain functions, including movement, sensation, memory, and emotions.</p><p>Approximately one to three percent of people worldwide have bipolar disorder. People with a family history of bipolar disorder are at increased risk of developing the condition. Most people develop the first symptoms of bipolar disorder between age 15 to 30 years; it is uncommon to develop the first symptoms of bipolar as a child or as an adult over the age of 65.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BIPOLAR DISORDER SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mania</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mania causes you to feel abnormally and persistently happy, angry, hyperactive, impulsive, and irrational at different times. These feelings last at least one week, and may be severe enough that you need to be treated in a hospital. Other symptoms may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of special powers and superiority</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased need for sleep, restlessness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talking excessively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Racing thoughts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short attention span</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate laughing or joking, or getting into lots of arguments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate spending sprees or sexual activity</p><p/><p>Mania often causes difficulty maintaining relationships with friends and family, and can interfere with work or other responsibilities. During a manic episode, your moods can change rapidly from euphoria to depression or irritability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypomania</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypomania is less severe than mania, but it causes a change in mood that is abnormal. Hypomanic episodes are usually briefer than manic episodes, but last for at least four days. Hypomania may not seriously affect your ability to work or go to school, and some people actually function better during a hypomanic episode. Hypomania may not need to be treated in a hospital, but it should be treated with medicines because it may lead to a manic or depressive episode.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with depression feel very sad and have trouble doing ordinary things like bathing, getting dressed, and cooking. During a depressive episode, you may feel sad most of the day or you may have little or no interest in any activity. Other symptoms may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss or gain (due to changes in how much you eat)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling irritated easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue, loss of energy, sluggishness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty concentrating and making decisions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurring thoughts of death or suicide</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol and drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 60 percent of people with bipolar disorder abuse alcohol or drugs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Suicide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of suicide also is higher in people with bipolar disorder compared to people with other psychiatric illnesses (including depression). Suicide is often the result of feeling hopeless, and is more likely in people with severe symptoms who must be hospitalized for treatment. If a family member or friend mentions suicide, you should consider this a serious threat and immediately contact the person's doctor or nurse. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call your doctor or nurse or go to the nearest emergency department.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">BIPOLAR DISORDER DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no test that can diagnose bipolar disorder. Instead, the diagnosis is based upon a medical and psychiatric history and a physical and mental status examination. Laboratory testing may be performed to rule out other diagnoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF MANIA IN BIPOLAR DISORDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of mania focuses on managing symptoms and keeping you safe. In the early phase of mania (called the acute phase), you may be psychotic (having false, fixed beliefs or hearing voices or seeing things others cannot see or hear). You may not be able to make good decisions and you may be at risk of hurting yourself or others. You may need to be treated in a hospital temporarily, until your medicine begins to work.</p><p>Medicines are the main treatment for mania, and a number of medicines are available. It is not usually possible to know ahead of time which medicine will be the most effective and cause the fewest side effects. It may be necessary to try several medicines before finding the best one.</p><p>Treatment of mania continues until your symptoms completely resolve and you are able to function. Many people continue to take medicine for a long time to prevent a recurrence of mania.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354705741\"><span class=\"h2\">Antipsychotic medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antipsychotic medicines are often used first in the treatment of mania. They may be used alone or in combination with other drugs (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other medications'</a> below); combination therapy is usually recommended for patients with severe mania. Side effects are common. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain antipsychotic medicines, such as olanzapine (brand name: Zyprexa), risperidone (brand name: Risperdal), and quetiapine (brand name: Seroquel) have a risk of weight gain, high blood sugar, diabetes mellitus, and high cholesterol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antipsychotic medicines ziprasidone (brand name: Geodon) and aripiprazole (brand name: Abilify) may work as well as other antipsychotic medicines, but with a lower risk of weight gain and diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clozapine (brand name: Clozaril) is an antipsychotic medicine that may be particularly effective in patients who do not respond to other mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. However, it carries a risk of lowering the white blood cell count to a dangerously low level. Blood testing is required once per week.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines such as lithium, valproate (sample brand names: Depakene, Depakote), and carbamazepine (sample brand names: Carbatrol, Tegretol), are also often used in the treatment of mania or hypomania. All of these medicines may be effective, and the choice is often made based upon what medicines you have taken before, side effects, and any underlying medical illnesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Lithium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lithium has been used for many years to treat mania. Studies also demonstrate that lithium may decrease the risk of suicide or self-harm (hurting oneself even without intending suicide). Common side effects of lithium can include frequent urination, tremor, loose stools, difficulty thinking clearly, or weight gain. Problems with kidney function, heart rhythm, or thyroid functioning can occur in people who take lithium for long periods of time.</p><p>A test to measure the lithium level in the blood is recommended regularly when taking lithium. Blood testing is usually done every 6 to 12 months once the lithium dose is stabilized.</p><p>Lithium can cause serious problems if you take an overdose or if your kidneys do not work normally. This can occur if you becomes severely dehydrated or take certain medicines with lithium. If you take lithium, talk to your healthcare provider before taking any new non-prescription or prescription medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Valproate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valproate is a medicine that is also effective in treating mania. It may be used instead of or in combination with lithium. Common side effects of valproate include weight gain, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, easy bruising, and tremor. Blood testing is usually done to check blood levels and to check for potential complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbamazepine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbamazepine is also helpful in the treatment of bipolar disorder. The most common side effects of carbamazepine include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, itching, and fluid retention. Blood testing is recommended to check blood levels and to check for potential complications.</p><p>Carbamazepine interferes with certain birth control methods (pill, vaginal ring, patch), making these methods less effective in preventing pregnancy (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Birth control'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION IN BIPOLAR DISORDER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354705815\"><span class=\"h2\">Antipsychotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antipsychotic medicines may help to treat bipolar depression (see <a href=\"#H354705741\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic medicines'</a> above). In particular, olanzapine or quetiapine can be helpful for patients with bipolar depression. In some cases, an antipsychotic medicine is combined with an antidepressant medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Lamotrigine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lamotrigine was developed to treat seizures, but it is also effective for people with bipolar depression. Routine blood tests are not needed for monitoring.</p><p>Lamotrigine can have serious side effects when taken with other medicines; be sure that your healthcare provider has an updated list of your prescription and nonprescription medicines. An infrequent but serious rash (called Stevens-Johnson syndrome) can occur early in treatment; call your healthcare provider if you notice a new rash while taking lamotrigine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354705836\"><span class=\"h3\">Lithium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lithium is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar depression. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Lithium'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat people with bipolar depression, sometimes in combination with a mood stabilizer. However, people with bipolar disorder who use antidepressants must be monitored closely because there is a chance that antidepressants can cause a manic episode.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an electrical current is passed through the brain, which in turn causes chemical changes that can relieve severe depression. While scientists do not yet fully understand exactly how ECT does this, they know it causes helpful changes to the molecules and cells of the brains of people with depression. ECT is especially effective for people with severe, life-threatening depression that has not responded to medicines. There is evidence that ECT may be effective in treating mania as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who undergo ECT are given general anesthesia to induce sleep and prevent discomfort. The patient is monitored carefully before, during, and after the treatment. Side effects of this therapy include brief confusion and memory loss. Although ECT has often been negatively portrayed in the media, it often provides rapid and dramatic relief of depression and has few side effects. ECT can be used in pregnant women and in those who cannot tolerate antidepressant or mood stabilizing medicines, and is especially useful for those who need a treatment that begins working rapidly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">BIPOLAR DISORDER MAINTENANCE THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the worst symptoms of mania or depression are under control, treatment focuses on preventing a recurrence. People who have suffered a manic episode are often advised to continue taking medicine(s) to control bipolar disorder. This usually includes a single mood stabilizing medicine, such as lithium or valproate. Other medicines may also be recommended if, for example, a single drug is not helpful or you cannot tolerate the side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychotherapy (counseling)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although medicines are the treatment of choice for bipolar disorder, counseling and talk therapy also have an important role in treatment. This is especially true after an acute episode has passed.</p><p>Psychotherapy may include individual counseling as well as education, marital and family therapy, or treatment of alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug abuse. Therapy can help you to stick with your medicine, which can decrease the risk of relapse and the need for hospitalization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">WOMEN AND BIPOLAR DISORDER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are taking medicines for bipolar disorder and considering pregnancy should talk with their doctor or nurse before trying to get pregnant. If you take medicine for bipolar and discover you are pregnant, do not stop your medicine suddenly. Instead, speak with your healthcare provider to determine if you should continue your medicine, change to another medicine, or slowly taper the medicine. Stopping your medicine during pregnancy (especially if this is done suddenly) can increase your risk of having manic or depressive episodes after your baby is born.</p><p>The decision to continue taking medicine during pregnancy is a hard one because of the potential risks to you (if you are not treated or undertreated), your developing baby, and your family. You should discuss all of the risks and benefits of treatment with a knowledgeable and experienced healthcare provider who can help to decide which treatment, if any, is best.</p><p>During your discussion, consider the following issues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants of women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of heart malformations. However, the risk is very low. An ultrasound of the baby's heart is usually recommended at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy to screen for heart defects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lithium can also cause complications if taken later in pregnancy. However, women who require lithium are often advised to continue taking it, though the dose may be adjusted. There are no known long-term behavioral effects of lithium in children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticonvulsant medicines, including carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate, increase the risk of birth defects and are not usually recommended during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you continue to take valproate or carbamazepine, you should take a supplement containing 4 milligrams of folic acid starting 3 months before trying to become pregnant and continuing for at least 3 months after becoming pregnant. This may reduce the risk of a type of birth defect, known as neural tube defects, which may be more common in infants of mothers who take valproate or carbamazepine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer antipsychotic medicines, including olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, are not known to cause birth defects, but there is not as much information about the safety of these medicines during pregnancy. In addition, there are no long-term data about how these medicines could potentially affect the child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential risks of antidepressant medicines are discussed in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics#H446121108\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Depression and pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the medicines used to treat bipolar disorder, including carbamazepine, interact with birth control pills, skin patch, and vaginal ring. As a result, women who take these medicines should consider another method of birth control (eg, an injection of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate, condoms, or an intrauterine device). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The blood level of one medicine, lamotrigine, is decreased in women who take birth control pills. Some women who take lamotrigine and a birth control pill will need a higher dose of lamotrigine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4869\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
