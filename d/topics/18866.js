Working pregnant women often request advice and assistance from their clinicians to manage challenges that occur while being pregnant at work. This topic will review issues including the impact of pregnancy on work, the impact of work on pregnancy, workplace exposure, leave time and discrimination, and requesting accommodations to enable pregnant women to continue working.</p><p>Topics related to occupational risks and exposure are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental health&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482894867\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the percentage of women in the labor force rose from 30 to nearly 60 percent between 1950 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For 2016, 57 percent of women ages 16 years and older were anticipated to be in the workforce. Of women with children under 18, 70 percent are in the labor force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Globally, 67 percent of women in developed countries between the ages of 15 to 64 years were employed in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As the number of women in the workforce has risen, so has the number of women working while pregnant. As an example, for women pregnant with their first child, 66 percent of mothers worked while pregnant in 2008 compared with only 44 percent in the early 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, women are working later into their pregnancies than ever before. In the early 1960s, 65 percent of pregnant women stopped work more than a month prior to delivery, while 35 percent continued working in their final month of pregnancy. By the late 2000s, the pattern had reversed, with 82 percent of pregnant women working until within one month of delivery and 18 percent stopping work earlier. More women are also returning to work within six months after their first birth than in previous decades (21 versus 73 percent from the early 1960s to the period of 2005 to 2007).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2804792733\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16490767\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy on work performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is associated with a wide variety of physical, functional, and emotional changes. While many women work while pregnant without any interference from pregnancy-related changes, problems of nausea and vomiting, pain, and fatigue can negatively impact a woman's work performance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting</strong> &ndash; Nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting can be provoked by workplace odors or restrictions around eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These problems can usually be managed with hydration, snacking as needed, taking a brief break, medication, and scheduling the most demanding work for times when the woman tends to feel less nauseous, if possible. Clinicians may need to request accommodations for their patients to allow for such non-medical interventions. In cases of severe vomiting requiring intensive outpatient intravenous or hospital-based therapy, a short-term absence from work can be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and outcome of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fatigue</strong> &ndash; In an interview study of first-time pregnant working women, the dominant theme was described as &quot;living on the edge of being overstretched&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Being exhausted from adapting to professional life while pregnant was a major contributor to this theme.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discomfort and pain</strong> &ndash; By the end of the second trimester and continuing through term, physical and physiologic changes can bring on heartburn, back pain, joint pain, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, and physical discomfort from the enlarging uterus. Ideally, the woman and her employer will be able to make reasonable adjustments to deal with these discomforts in the workplace. Simple precautions that can help reduce excessive fatigue, discomfort, and potentially reduce the risk of pregnancy complications include modifying shift times and tasks; minimizing lifting, bending, and prolonged standing; using proper lifting techniques; taking regular breaks every few hours and a longer break after five hours; and drinking plenty of fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. However, lost work time and interruptions in workflow can be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Musculoskeletal changes and pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive function</strong> &ndash; A meta-analysis of 20 studies, including over 700 pregnant women, found that general cognitive functioning (standard mean differences [SMD] 1.28; 95% CI 0.26-2.30), memory (SMD 1.47; 95% CI, 0.27-2.68), and executive functioning (SMD 0.46; 95% CI, 0.03-0.89) were significantly reduced during the third trimester of pregnancy but not during the first two trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Longitudinal studies found declines between the first and second trimesters in general cognitive functioning (SMD 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-0.50) and memory (SMD 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54) but not between the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Pregnant/postpartum</span> group report more subjective difficulties with memory, mood, and quality of life than control women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. More data are needed to understand the impact of pregnancy on cognitive function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16490619\"><span class=\"h2\">Work on pregnancy and child development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite data limitations, working while pregnant generally does not appear to negatively impact maternal or fetal health. The effect of work on pregnancy outcome is difficult to assess because available data are often contradictory, largely retrospective, and subject to multiple sources of bias, including inadequate adjustment for confounders, recall bias, selective participation, and subjective assessment of exposures. In particular, a potential bias in observational studies of outcomes of pregnant women who work or do not work is the &quot;healthy worker&quot; effect whereby healthier workers are more likely to continue to work and work in more demanding jobs than women with less robust health.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Systematic reviews have generally concluded that standard working conditions present little hazard to maternal or child health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy who is employed where there are no greater potential hazards than those encountered in routine daily life may continue to work without interruption until the onset of labor. However, the physical demands of the woman's job are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, especially in women who have medical or obstetrical disorders that are unstable or associated with impaired placental perfusion (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction). As an example, studies of the effect of work on a woman's risk of developing hypertension during pregnancy generally report no significant association; however, the risk may depend on the occupational classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. While available evidence is inadequate to support a change in occupational responsibilities for prevention of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, limited data do support changes in physical activity in the management of some women who develop these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;, section on 'Occupational physical activity'</a> and <a href=\"#H16486236\" class=\"local\">'Selected workplace exposures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Child development</strong> &ndash; Assessing the impact of maternal employment on children's development is difficult because of selection bias and missing data (eg, quality of childcare, home environment, maternal sensitivity to the child's needs, paternal factors). While the literature is conflicting, the body of evidence generally reports that if there are any adverse effects of maternal employment on child development, these effects are likely to be small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p/><p>Women in lower socioeconomic groups may represent an exception to the above information. In a 2014 survey study of 1400 pregnant French workers, women classified as deprived were more likely to encounter occupational hazards, have three or more occupational exposures during a pregnancy, and, for those with three or more occupational exposures, have a preterm delivery when compared with non-deprived women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Similarly, in a study from the national Swedish Registry, low levels of job control and high levels of physical demands and job hazards were more common in manual compared with non-manual labor classes. In multivariate analyses, class differences in maternal working conditions explained 14 to 38 percent of low-birth-weight births and 20 to 46 percent of preterm births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2433848899\"><span class=\"h1\">WORK CHARACTERISTICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16490625\"><span class=\"h2\">Hours, shift, and type of work</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with healthy uncomplicated singleton pregnancies, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and the Faculty of Occupational Medicine (FOM) of the United Kingdom concluded that available evidence did not justify imposing mandatory restrictions to working hours, shift work, lifting, standing, and physical work during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Challenges to writing such guidelines include lack of data demonstrating a clear cut-off at which work is detrimental to the health of most women and fetuses as well as the reality that some women must continue working while pregnant for economic reasons, regardless of medical advice. Any guidelines must also balance data suggesting that some level of physical activity while pregnant is healthy. Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) state that physical activity during pregnancy is beneficial to most women, exercise is safe for both mother and fetus, and exercising while pregnant carries little risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In addition, abstaining from work can create hardships that need to be considered and balanced with the anxiety and uncertainty of possible low levels of risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One United States analysis of &quot;occupational physical activity&quot; reported that high activity levels were significantly associated with small for gestational age (SGA) for the highest quartile compared with lowest quartile and were also positively associated with preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast, analysis of the impact of nonoccupational activity suggests that low physical activity may increase at least preterm birth risk compared to higher levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. While activity during pregnancy is generally encouraged, the point at which extreme activity, such as that imposed by extended work hours, shift work, and heavy work, transitions from benefit to harm is less clear, in part because data are derived from observational studies, the definition of important outcomes varies by patient, and women interpret and tolerate risk differently. Thus, the physical demands of the woman's job should be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially in women at higher risk of preterm delivery or who have medical or obstetrical disorders that are unstable or associated with impaired placental perfusion (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction).</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">RCP/FOM</span> guideline reported that long working hours (&gt;40 hours per week), shift work (working a schedule other than 7 AM to 5 PM five days a week), prolonged standing (&gt;3 to 4 hours of continuous standing), and lifting and heavy physical work may increase the risk of preterm delivery, SGA infant, miscarriage, and pregnancy-associated hypertension to a small degree, but the confidence intervals for many of the variables were not significant, and thus the data are also compatible with no effect (or even a small benefit) from work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The uncertainty in the estimated risk reflected both the amount and quality of available evidence. These findings are generally consistent with those reported in other systematic reviews and meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. These job requirements may be more common in pregnant women than previously thought. In one large nationally representative data set, 31 percent of women reported standing for more than 75 percent of their time at their jobs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>A different review of studies assessing the impact of fixed and rotating shift work schedules reported that while the studies were not conclusive, the evidence suggested that both work schedules were associated with menstrual cycle disturbances and miscarriages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the effect size was uncertain. In a retrospective study of 440 female employees in a semiconductor factory, persistent rotating shifts among factory workers was associated with lower birth weights compared with fixed or intermittently rotating shifts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530690326\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2013, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published clinical guidelines for occupational lifting in uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The recommended weight limits are based on gestational age, intermittent versus repetitive lifting, time <span class=\"nowrap\">(hours/day)</span> spent lifting, and lifting height from floor and distance in front of body. In this guideline, the maximum permissible weight for a woman less than 20 weeks of gestation performing infrequent lifting is 36 pounds (16 kg) and the maximum permissible weight at &ge;20 weeks is 26 pounds (12 kg). For repetitive lifting &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">hour/day,</span> the maximum weights in the first and second half of pregnancy are 18 pounds (8 kg) and 13 pounds (6 kg), respectively, and for repetitive lifting &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">hour/day,</span> the maximum weights are 30 pounds (14 kg) and 22 pounds (10 kg), respectively. Although not based on high-quality evidence, these guidelines are a reasonable reference for counseling pregnant women.</p><p>Individual studies provide risk estimates in subpopulations of women. For example, a study based on the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996 to 2002) of over 71,500 occupationally active women assessed the relationship between total weight lifted per day and miscarriage, which was not evaluated in the above guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Compared to non-lifters, the hazard ratio (HR) for early miscarriage (&le;12 weeks) increased in women who lifted a large amount of weight over the course of the day: 101 to 200 kg total weight lifted per day HR 1.38 (95% CI 1.10-1.74) and &gt;1000 kg total weight lifted per day HR 2.02 (95% CI 1.23-3.33). Late miscarriage (13 to 21 weeks) was associated with total daily weight load but not with number of lifts per day. No association was found between occupational lifting and stillbirth. The study was adjusted for daily smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical exercise, leisure-time daily lifting, and predominant working posture (ie, primarily standing or walking, primarily sitting, or varying).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16490631\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether working while pregnant increases or decreases a woman's overall stress likely depends on the woman's individual circumstances. As stress has been associated with poor reproductive outcomes, clinicians are encouraged to ask women about all sources of stress in their lives. In a national population-based control study in the United State, the most common source of emotional stress at work was dealing with unpleasant or angry people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Women who identified as non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic were more likely to be in jobs in which they had to address angry or unpleasant people &ge;75 percent of the time compared with non-Hispanic white women or women who identified as other. </p><p>While issues related to work, the occupational setting, and job requirements may increase stress, they also may have a positive influence both directly (eg, social support from coworkers) and indirectly (eg, income stability, maintenance of medical insurance, available nutrition, protection from interpersonal violence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, significant stressors can develop in non-work-related aspects of the patient's life (eg, childcare, family illness). The influence of psychosocial factors on pregnancy outcomes may occur either directly via physiological pathways, or indirectly via behavioral pathways, or both. Psychosocial stress may also lead to unhealthy behaviors, including key behavioral risk factors for preterm birth such as poor <span class=\"nowrap\">diet/nutrition</span> and smoking.</p><p>Maternal-placental-fetal neuroendocrine, <span class=\"nowrap\">immune/inflammatory</span> and vascular processes all are responsive to stress, participate in the physiology of parturition, and may provide biological pathways that influence pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Stress is a common element activating a series of physiologic adaptive responses in the maternal and fetal compartments. Emerging data suggest that greater cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to acute stressors are predictive of poorer birth outcomes, but data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, maternal stress may also play a role in the development (or mis-development) of neural networks, also known as the connectome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. One response involves activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which can initiate preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another response involves chronic extended activation of the sympathetic nervous system with increased secretion of catecholamines, which may decrease uterine blood flow and, in turn, lead to increased secretion of placental CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While a population-based cohort study reported that psychosocial work stress (high demands and low control) was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were not studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Symptoms of lead toxicity (fatigue, muscle and joint pain, abdominal cramps, headaches, and irritability) appear when lead levels are between 60 and 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> in the blood. OSHA recommends a lead level less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> to prevent reproductive problems. However, neurologic, hematologic, and reproductive effects may occur at lower levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In pregnant women, blood lead elevations of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> are of high concern because of the potential for adverse effects on the developing fetus, which is more susceptible to lead's toxic effects. Even lead levels less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> may be of concern in pregnancy in light of studies demonstrating intellectual impairment in children with blood lead concentrations below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women working in known areas of lead exposure should always wear protective clothing, change work clothing and shoes before going home, use respiratory equipment to avoid inhalation, and wash hands before handling food and drinks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The following figure illustrates the approach to management of women based on their serum lead level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75815 \">figure 1</a>).

While inhaling metallic mercury over time can affect all systems in the body, the brain and kidneys are the most likely to be affected at lower levels. In pregnancy, exposure to mercury can be associated with multiple adverse effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females&quot;, section on 'Mercury'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercury-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mercury toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mercury can be found in elemental, inorganic, and organic forms. Elemental mercury is inhaled through vapors and fumes and is the least absorbed form of mercury. Persons working in light bulb manufacturing facilities, dental facilities, and gold-mining industries in undeveloped countries where mercury fumes are high have the greatest risks of elemental exposures. Women working with dental amalgam are at risk of exposure to elemental mercury. Inorganic mercury is found in fungicides, antiseptics and disinfectants and may be absorbed in toxic levels through the skin. Organic mercury is consumed by eating fish with high levels of methylmercury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish consumption and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mercury testing is indicated in patients at risk of high mercury exposure or who have symptoms of mercury toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Urine is used to test for exposure to elemental mercury (metallic mercury vapor, inorganic mercury). Blood or scalp hair is used to monitor exposure to methylmercury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercury-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mercury toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pesticides</strong> &ndash; Every class of pesticide (organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, herbicides, fungicides, fumigants, organochlorines) appears to have at least one agent capable of negatively affecting a reproductive or developmental endpoint in animals or humans. Epidemiologic studies have reported adverse reproductive or developmental outcomes with mixed pesticide exposure in occupational settings, particularly when personal protective equipment was not used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In a population-based case-control study assessing the association of organochloride pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with autism and intellectual disability (without autism), higher maternal serum levels of PCBs were associated with both conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Strengths of the study included use of stored second-trimester serum to assess exposure and controlling for confounding that may have resulted from demographic factors. Counseling patients who are concerned about reproductive and developmental effects of pesticides involves helping them assess their degree of exposure, weighing risks and benefits of this exposure, and adopting practices to reduce or eliminate exposure and absorption.

Household solvents are usually not a major risk since exposure is episodic and air levels are low. However, women with industrial exposure appear to be at some risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>], which depends on dose and duration of exposure. Exposure to organic solvents has been linked to congenital heart disease. In addition, one study has reported a possible association between maternal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and an increased risk of craniosynostosis in the offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Both maternal and paternal occupational exposures have been linked to sporadic retinoblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. PAHs are used in a number of jobs, including the oil and gas industries, coal-fired and other power plants, and restaurants.

Exposure can occur through direct or indirect contact with these substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Although health care facilities recommend universal precautions, employees should ask for a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) when they work in areas exposed to hazardous materials. Hazardous materials should be prepared in well-ventilated areas, handlers should wear protective clothing (double gloves, gowns, eye protective gear), and all spills should be cleaned immediately and cleaning material discarded properly. Employers should provide training sessions to employees about hazardous materials in the workplace. It is required to have guidelines and procedures on handling and storage, use, preparation, cleaning spills, decontamination, first aid measures, handling accidental release, and firefighting measures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occupational exposures to chemotherapeutic agents have been linked to some adverse pregnancy outcomes. In a meta-analysis of seven studies, exposure to chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.92) but not with congenital malformations (OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.91-2.94) or stillbirths (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.73-1.82) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Evidence supporting an association between occupational exposure to inhalational anesthetics and reproductive toxicity is weak and biased from studies performed in the pre-scavenging era.

The likelihood of adverse sequelae if a pregnant woman becomes infected depends on several factors, including the type of infection and the trimester during which the exposure occurred (refer to individual topic reviews on each infection). Pregnant women working in health care facilities should always use universal precautions when coming in contact with children or adults who may have an infectious disease and should have appropriate immunizations before and during pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16486278\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) lists limits for prenatal radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Women should not be exposed to more than 5 mSv during the nine months of pregnancy and no more than 0.5 mSv during any gestational month. Women working in an environment with radiation exposure should wear a dosimeter badge, which is processed every two to four weeks. They should also be encouraged to wear proper shielding (eg, lead apron) if exposure is expected, minimize the time of exposure, and maximize their distance from the source of radiation. The risks of radiation exposure in pregnancy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Non-ionizing radiation (eg, electromagnetic fields emitted from computers, microwave communication systems and ovens, power lines, cellular phones, household appliances, heating pads and warming blankets, airport screening devices for metal objects) appear to have minimal reproductive risk. Video display terminals (VDTs) emit very low frequency and extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields. Literature reviews have generally concluded that there is no evidence of a significant association between a woman's use of a VDT and fetal loss or other adverse reproductive outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. However, ergonometric issues related to use of computers in the workplace (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome, low back pain) may be more problematic for pregnant women.

Animal studies suggest that perinatal risks (eg, central nervous system, vascular disruption, neural defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]) increase with maternal heat exposure. Similar findings were found in human studies related to febrile illnesses, sauna use, and hot tub use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) guidelines address protection of workers in hot environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Employers of facilities with risk for high temperature should institute measures to minimize environment and metabolic heat exposure (eg, good ventilation to draw steam and heat from work areas, cooling fans, heat shields, labor saving devices, rest periods in cooler areas, hydration) and provide training to employees on how to recognize heat-related illnesses. In areas where heat is unavoidable, employees should take precautions to avoid heat stress and heat-related complications. Pregnant women should be encouraged to increase fluid intake, request periodic breaks from the heated area, and dress in light clothing to avoid overheating.

Women who have concerns about unfair treatment during pregnancy can consult legal services.</p><p>Legal and regulatory issues vary among countries and between states in the United States. A synopsis of laws that serve as the basis of the United States federal legal framework, which applies in all states, is described below. These laws include the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and the Family Medical Act (FMLA) of 1993. These and related court rulings clarify legal expectations related to potential discrimination of pregnant women, their protection related to any occupation related disability, and employer provided benefits to which they are entitled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1812201459\"><span class=\"h2\">Workplace discrimination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PDA of 1978 amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. This act requires employers with 15 or more employees to offer medical disability benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities just like all other temporary disabilities under any health, disability, insurance or sick leave plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Pregnant workers must be provided the same insurance benefits, accommodations, sick leave, seniority credits, and reinstatement privileges awarded workers disabled by other causes. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a pregnant employee can make a prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating that &quot;she belongs to the protected class, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not accommodate her.&quot; Such circumstances may merit a summary judgement standard &quot;by providing evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers.&quot;</p><p>If an employer requires employees to obtain a clinician's note when taking sick leaves and collecting benefits, the same rule can be applied to pregnant employees.</p><p>In the United States, federal law prohibits discrimination due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions under the PDA and ADA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/working-during-pregnancy/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. The ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) in 2008 directed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to modify the degree of limitation defined as a disability replacing &quot;severely or significantly&quot; with &quot;substantially limits,&quot; a more lenient standard. The ADA and ADAAA also apply to employers with 15 or more employees, including state and local governments. Provisions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant employees must be allowed to work so long as they can perform their jobs.

These in turn influence the actions the person takes related to the risk, including, for a pregnant woman, those related to her work.

However, she does not need to mention FMLA; FMLA designation is at the discretion of the employer. Generally an employer may retroactively reclassify other leave time (eg, sick time, paid vacation) to be part of an FMLA leave only if they do so within two business days of becoming aware that the leave qualified as FMLA leave.

Challenges to writing such guidelines include the lack of data demonstrating a clear cut-off at which work is detrimental to the health of most women and fetuses as well as the reality that some women must continue working while pregnant for economic reasons, regardless of medical advice. Any guidelines must also balance the data suggesting that some level of physical activity while pregnant is healthy. (See <a href=\"#H2433848899\" class=\"local\">'Work characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/&amp;token=mJ2XuLqdLLe0+A8rZisyxo1Q1txSY7aHggTHFVQofO0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=439\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) sets and enforces standards requiring employers to provide a workplace free from recognized hazards likely to cause serious physical harm. Every employer is mandated to have a Hazard Communication Safety Data Sheets that contain information on the chemical properties and health effects of the substances used in the workplace. Exposure to these potential hazards should be minimized or avoided, but do not necessarily warrant leaving the job. (See <a href=\"#H3451107536\" class=\"local\">'Obligations of employer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians caring for working pregnant women are often asked for advice and documentation for workplace accommodations or medical leave. (See <a href=\"#H440425209\" class=\"local\">'Workplace accommodations and leave'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Workplace accommodations are &quot;reasonable adjustments to your duties or work setting to allow you to continue working safely while pregnant or recovering from pregnancy.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H440425209\" class=\"local\">'Workplace accommodations and leave'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medical leave is time away from work for the woman who cannot safely perform the essential components of her job because of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Medical leave typically applies to complications of pregnancy or childbirth. Being pregnant is itself not a disability. Impairments that are automatically considered disabilities are listed by the United States <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm&amp;token=KpqDFfr6EUAB5cGumHLcPjY5uHDI7Ml5eUUwXy4xjqXLAI9wybctVhm15ZuSgtimhY+c4Ok87XZ2+mEGeUfMnO0TcWgjTq+EXCz9Rtrd/v4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=439\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Social Security Administration</a>. (See <a href=\"#H440425209\" class=\"local\">'Workplace accommodations and leave'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women in the workplace should understand their rights in the workplace, familiarize themselves with local and national laws about maternity leave, review the duration of and benefits granted during maternity leave, and understand expectations about their return to the workplace. To be protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a patient must have a specific impairment that &quot;substantially limits one or more major life activities.&quot; Most healthy pregnant women do not meet the definition of disability and thus do not qualify for an alteration in their work status before the onset of labor.
