These disorders are considered a form of stroke, with a similar clinical approach and management; the clinician attempts to treat the acute event, find the source of the vascular occlusion, and prevent further vascular events from occurring.</p><p>Issues related to central and branch retinal artery occlusion will be reviewed here. Other ocular ischemic syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular or binocular visual loss)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood flowing to the retina travels through blood vessels that are subject to varying environments and external pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The central retinal artery arises from the ophthalmic artery, itself a branch of the internal carotid artery. The ophthalmic artery departs from the intracranial portion of the carotid artery at a sharp angle, after which it travels intracranially for a short distance before entering the orbit, usually with the optic nerve. Once entering the orbit, the central retinal artery leaves the ophthalmic artery to enter the cerebral spinal fluid space and then travel within the optic nerve, after which it enters the eye, where it is subjected to intraocular pressure.</p><p>The central retinal artery supplies the inner retina and the surface of the optic nerve. In about 15 percent of individuals, it is assisted by a branch of the ciliary circulation, the cilioretinal artery, which may supply a portion of the retina, including the macula. This allows for preservation of vision in some patients with central retinal artery occlusion.</p><p>The physiology of central retinal artery function is poorly understood, but it is primarily autoregulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This means that under a range of systemic mean arterial pressures, ocular blood flow remains constant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of vascular injury'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a rare event with an incidence of approximately 1 to 10 in 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Symptomatic branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) is even less common.</p><p>Demographic characteristics of patients with CRAO and BRAO are consistent with those seen for other vascular disorders. The mean age of patients is between 60 and 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. More than 90 percent of patients with CRAO and BRAO are over the age of 40 years, although individuals as young as 12 years have been affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. Men are more commonly affected than women. Hypertension, smoking, and diabetes are more prevalent among patients with retinal artery occlusion compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Patients presenting with CRAO often have a previously undiagnosed vascular risk factor (eg, hyperlipidemia, hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central and branch retinal artery occlusions share a similar list of potential etiologies. Case series that attempt to define a distribution of etiologies are small <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> include a heterogeneous case mix of amaurosis and asymptomatic retinal emboli in addition to CRAO and BRAO. In addition, diagnostic evaluations are not standardized and vary between studies.</p><p>The distribution of etiologies is also influenced by the patient's age. Carotid artery atherosclerosis is the most common etiology for retinal artery occlusion overall, but is relatively unusual in patients under 40, in whom cardiogenic embolism is the most likely etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In patients over 70 years of age, giant cell arteritis is more likely than in younger patients. Ethnicity may also be relevant; as an example, carotid artery occlusive disease is most prevalent among Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Determining the underlying etiology is important to preventing recurrent CRAO and BRAO and other vascular complications. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of etiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Carotid artery atherosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atherosclerotic disease of the ipsilateral carotid artery is the most common cause of retinal artery occlusion. The reported prevalence of significant carotid artery disease among patients with CRAO or BRAO is 10 to 30 percent in most case series but values as high as 70 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/10,14-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14-23</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis of high-grade carotid disease in the setting of retinal artery occlusion is important because of the risk for future stroke and other vascular events. Compared with cerebral ischemia, retinal ischemia has been reported to carry a lower risk for stroke in the setting of high-grade carotid disease (&gt;70 percent stenosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, these case series generally also include transient monocular visual loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asymptomatic retinal emboli, which might be expected to have a more benign prognosis than CRAO or BRAO. In one report, three of seven patients with CRAO and high-grade carotid disease had a subsequent stroke over 4.5 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This suggests that CRAO may be similar to cerebral infarction in predicting future stroke risk in the setting of high-grade carotid stenosis.</p><p>Carotid endarterectomy is likely to significantly reduce the risk of future stroke in patients with retinal artery occlusion and high-grade carotid stenosis, although this subgroup has not been specifically studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In some series, this is found in as many as 48 percent of patients (range 2 to 48) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/10,15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,23</a>].

In the acute phase, fluorescein angiography shows slowed or absent filling of the central retinal artery with normal filling of the choroid. If the choroid is also affected, giant cell arteritis (GCA) should be considered, especially in an elderly patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum C-reactive protein should be measured in all individuals over age 50 with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and no visible retinal emboli to exclude GCA. Although GCA is relatively rare in this setting, acute treatment with corticosteroids improves visual outcomes (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory disease'</a> above). If the ESR or serum CRP is elevated or if the clinical setting is very suggestive, the patient should be evaluated for GCA and possible treatment with high-dose corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other diagnostic testing in patients with retinal artery occlusion is focused on determining the underlying etiology. These are generally not required for acute management decisions.

If there is concomitant involvement of the choroidal circulation, pigmentary changes under the retina may develop after many weeks or months. Over time, the optic nerve turns pale due to loss of the normal translucent appearance of the axon bundles, which are replaced by more reflective glial tissue. The retinal nerve fiber layer gradually becomes thin. The retinal blood vessels may remain attenuated or return to their normal size.</p><p>The prognosis varies with the site of retinal artery occlusion. Most patients (80 percent) with BRAO recover normal vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], while spontaneous clinical improvement from CRAO is rare. In experimental studies, the retina can survive for only 90 to 100 minutes after ligation of the central retinal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>].</p><p>Visual acuity at presentation usually predicts final visual acuity in patients with CRAO. While there are reports of patients who have recovered vision days after apparent CRAO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], most severely affected patients are left only with a temporal island of vision that allows for hand motions or counting fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. In one series of 34 consecutive cases of CRAO, only 35 percent were left with a visual acuity of better than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/100</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. In another series of 73 CRAOs, only four eyes recovered visual acuity better than counting fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ocular emergency. Before any other investigation, attempts to recover vision in the affected eye should be made or at least considered. Animal studies suggest that restoration of blood flow within 90 to 100 minutes leads to no retinal injury, while occlusions persisting for longer than 240 minutes produce massive irreversible damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, there are no clinical trials to determine if any treatment is effective. Some patients do recover spontaneously, and apparently successful maneuvers to recover vision may reflect this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. A 2009 review concluded that among patients with nonarteritic CRAO, there was not enough evidence to decide if any interventions reportedly used in the treatment of CRAO result in any beneficial or harmful effect on visual outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. A 2010 retrospective analysis of CRAO patients showed there was no difference in clinical outcome between standard of care (paracentesis, ocular massage, intraocular hypotensive agents) versus observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, given the poor prognosis of visual recovery after CRAO, some attempt at treatment is usually made if the patient presents early, within the first 24 hours. </p><p>Given the less-dire prognosis, acute treatments with uncertain efficacy are generally not provided for branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). Clinical efforts instead focus on determining the underlying etiology and preventing future vascular events. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Long-term prognosis and management'</a> below.)</p><p>An important exception is the use of corticosteroids in the rare patient with CRAO secondary to giant cell arteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In these patients, prompt initiation of corticosteroids improves the prognosis for vision in both the affected and unaffected eye.

While serious complications are a concern with this treatment, only 6 of the 100 cases reviewed had a complication, none with permanent morbidity. Subsequent reports have largely echoed this experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/97-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-100</a>]. However, a randomized controlled trial compared intra-arterial thrombolysis with rtPA to conservative therapy in 84 patients with CRAO within 20 hours (mean 12 hours) of symptom onset and found no difference in visual outcomes between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in two of the treated patients. The long time-to-treatment in this study may have contributed to the findings.</p><p>There is little information regarding the use of systemic administration of thrombolytic therapy for CRAO. Local (intraarterial) administration has the advantage of providing the thrombolytic agent in close proximity to the occlusion and allowing titration of the dose to achieve revascularization, thus optimizing efficacy and minimizing complications. At present, the risks associated with systemic thrombolysis (intracerebral and systemic hemorrhage) are felt to be unfavorable compared with potential benefit for CRAO. A phase II study of intravenous tPA CRAO is ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. </p><p>Surgical revascularization techniques are also under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].
