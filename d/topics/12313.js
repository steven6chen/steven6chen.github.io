Breast reconstruction provides psychological, social, emotional, and functional improvements, including improved psychological health, self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>], sexuality, and body image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. Patients who choose breast reconstruction are presented with complex decisions, including the type and timing of reconstruction. </p><p>This topic review will discuss the preoperative assessment and evaluation of candidates for immediate or delayed breast reconstruction, special clinical settings (contralateral mastectomies, radiation therapy), and physical and psychologic outcomes. The approaches for reconstruction, including autologous tissue reconstruction and prosthetic devices (implants), are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implant-based breast reconstruction and augmentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UTILIZATION AND PATTERNS OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes research on quality-of-life improvements and psychosocial benefits associated with breast reconstruction served as the driving force for the 1998 Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, which mandated healthcare payer coverage for breast and nipple reconstruction, contralateral procedures to achieve symmetry, and treatment for the sequelae of mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This was followed in 2001 by additional legislation imposing penalties on noncompliant insurers. Despite such legislation in the United States, breast reconstruction still remains an underutilized option. The underlying reasons seem to be multifactorial and related to socioeconomic factors, including access to care, insurance coverage, education, and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> as well as geographic location, age, and personal choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. </p><p>In other countries, patterns of utilization differ. As an example, in a British study of over 13,000 women, clinicians were broadly following guidance, except with respect to patients' age. Nearly 50 percent were offered immediate breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The three factors most strongly associated with the likelihood of an offer were degree of tumor burden, whether radiotherapy was planned, and performance status. Increasing age was associated with a fall in the probability of an offer beyond that expected based upon tumor and comorbidity characteristics. In a Canadian study, the incidence of immediate breast reconstruction is between 10 and 20 percent based upon 2011 statistics. A lack of insurance or availability of plastic surgeons is not the primary reason for this; rather, it appears to be the lack of available operating rooms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Although the overall rate of breast reconstruction is increasing, the number of women who undergo reconstruction after mastectomy remains low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The low rates of breast reconstruction are in part due to a low referral rate to plastic surgeons. A survey of attending general surgeons from a population-based sample of 1844 women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 showed that only 24 percent of surgeons referred more than 75 percent of their mastectomy patients to plastic surgeons prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A survey of patients diagnosed with breast cancer reported that the desire to avoid additional surgery was the most common reason given for not pursuing reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Inadequate education about reconstructive options also plays a role. In a study of 84 women treated with mastectomy, participants were able to correctly respond to only 38 percent of questions about reconstruction options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Approximately 40 percent of all patients undergoing a mastectomy in the United States undergo breast reconstruction. Immediate breast reconstruction is increasing by approximately 5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and is often recommended when it is oncologically safe and in patients who are good candidates. Immediate restoration of the breast is often associated with improved body image and self-esteem. Immediate breast reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic implants or autologous tissues.<strong> </strong>Implant-based reconstruction has been increasing at a rate of 11 percent per year, while the rate of autologous reconstruction has remained unchanged. Additional studies have demonstrated that unilateral mastectomy rates are decreasing by 2 percent per year, whereas contralateral and bilateral prophylactic mastectomies are increasing at the rate of 15 percent and 12 percent per year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The reasons for these changes are multifactorial and include risk reduction and improved aesthetic outcomes. With the advent of genetic testing, many women are choosing to undergo prophylactic mastectomy, either of the contralateral breast or bilaterally. Some surgeons feel that aesthetic outcomes are typically improved following bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction because of the ability to achieve better symmetry. However, symmetry following unilateral mastectomy and reconstruction can be readily achieved by symmetrizing procedures on the contralateral breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Plastic surgeons are able to optimize aesthetic outcomes because of our wide range of reconstructive options that include improved prosthetic devices and the use of patients' own body tissues with minimal morbidity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44798653\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES FOR BREAST RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for breast reconstruction following total mastectomy include prosthetic devices and autologous tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689804321\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reconstruction using prosthetic devices can be performed in one or two stages. With one-stage reconstruction, a permanent implant is inserted at the time of mastectomy. With two-stage reconstruction, a tissue expander is placed following the mastectomy and gradually filled to the desired volume. A permanent implant is used to replace the tissue expander at a later date. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implant-based breast reconstruction and augmentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689804352\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possible donor sites for autologous tissue breast reconstruction include the abdomen, posterior thorax, medial thighs, or buttock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689804341\"><span class=\"h3\">Reconstruction following oncoplastic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oncoplastic surgery is often considered in women that will have breast conserving surgery to prevent or minimize the occurrence of a contour abnormality or significant asymmetry. It is defined as a wider resection of the breast cancer when compared with traditional breast conserving surgery followed by the immediate or staged-immediate reconstruction of the breast deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It incorporates principles of tissue rearrangement and replacement to restore breast contour and symmetry. The benefits of oncoplastic resection compared with lumpectomy are that the margin of excision is increased, reexcision rates are decreased, and the need for completion mastectomy is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oncoplastic techniques in breast-conserving surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oncoplastic reconstruction can be performed immediately following resection or be delayed (staged). The reconstructive process is completed before the onset of radiation therapy that is typically required following partial mastectomy. The risks of immediate oncoplastic surgery include a positive tumor margin on final pathologic evaluation that often requires a reexcision, or in some cases, a mastectomy. The options for oncoplastic reconstruction include volume displacement and volume replacement procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oncoplastic techniques in breast-conserving surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume displacement procedures include adjacent tissue rearrangement, mastopexy, and reduction mammaplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These are usually considered in women with moderate to severe mammary hypertrophy. The goals of this technique are to preserve <span class=\"nowrap\">nipple/areolar</span> viability when possible, to close the cavity created, and to reshape the breast mound. The simplest method is to rearrange the adjacent tissues using principles of tissue undermining along natural planes, mobilize the defect edges, and close. The more common approach is to perform a reduction mammaplasty. The partial mastectomy is performed first and typically includes a specimen that weighs between 100 and 200 grams. The reduction mammaplasty is then performed utilizing parenchymal flaps of breast tissue to obliterate the space. The contralateral breast is reduced at the same time. Radiation therapy is commenced three to four weeks following the operation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume replacement procedures include adjacent pedicle flaps or free tissue transfer to obliterate the cavity that was created [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These techniques are usually recommended for women with small to moderate breast volume who do not have enough breast tissue to safely and aesthetically perform a reduction mammaplasty. Options for volume replacement include the latissimus dorsi flap or the thoracodorsal artery perforator flap for lateral, superior, and inferior breast defects as well as internal mammary artery perforator flaps for medial defects. In a study comparing outcomes between skin-sparing mastectomy with latissimus dorsi flaps and oncoplastic surgery with latissimus dorsi flaps, overall aesthetic and psychological outcomes were good for both cohorts; however, the oncoplastic cohort had fewer adverse surgical and physical sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin grafting and skin substitutes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44798710\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following breast reconstruction using prosthetic devices or autologous tissues, secondary procedures are often necessary to improve symmetry, reconstruct the nipple, or handle contour abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>]. In the United States, these are usually covered by insurance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689804459\"><span class=\"h2\">Obtaining symmetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once reconstruction of the affected breast has begun, the challenge of creating symmetry with the contralateral breast is undertaken. Mastopexy, breast reduction, breast augmentation, or a combination of procedures can be used to improve symmetry and aesthetics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62910\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62910 \">picture 1</a>). As an example, in a woman with very large breasts who undergoes a mastectomy with reconstruction, a contralateral breast reduction will decrease the size discrepancy, resulting in improved patient comfort and increased symmetry. Contralateral breast surgery can be performed at the time of the initial reconstruction or at a second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implant-based breast reconstruction and augmentation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689804465\"><span class=\"h2\">Nipple reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following completion of the breast reconstruction, women are given the option of nipple-areolar reconstruction. This is typically performed during the second stage of breast reconstruction, but can also be performed in an office setting. The goal of nipple and areolar reconstruction is to achieve symmetry of position of the nipple-areolar complex in the contralateral breast with comparable appearance and color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There are multiple techniques by which a nipple and areola can be created. Surgical methods involve local tissue rearrangement procedures or skin grafts, while others use donor sites that are closed primarily. Nipple projection varies among the different techniques, but adequate results can be achieved with most. Symmetry of position on the breast mound is the most important goal of nipple reconstruction, as even small discrepancies are obvious. Once the projecting papilla has been created, the appearance of the entire nipple-areola complex can be enhanced by the use of tattooing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54178\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54178 \">picture 2</a>). An alternative to surgical reconstruction of a nipple is three-dimensional tattoo. This is usually performed in a nonmedical setting by an experienced tattoo artist. The results have been excellent and patient satisfaction has been high. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689804471\"><span class=\"h2\">Handling contour abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 to 40 percent of women undergoing breast conserving surgery will develop a contour abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>]. The adverse change in contour can be particularly challenging to correct if the patient also received radiation therapy to the breast. The initial assessment includes a thorough evaluation of the skin and parenchymal quality, as well as an assessment of the degree of postradiation skin damage. The cutaneous and glandular elements often become fibrotic and scarred after radiation treatments. The most common contemporary reconstructive procedure performed to restore a breast contour is fat grafting (autologous fat transfer). Prospective studies have shown that fat grafting is an effective approach to correct these deformities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Other surgical approaches include mastopexy and reduction mammaplasty. While these procedures can effectively restore the breast contour for patients after breast conserving surgery, complications, including delayed healing, infection, and fat necrosis are more common for women who have also been treated with radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a study comparing secondary procedures following breast conserving surgery, ipsilateral breast <span class=\"nowrap\">reduction/mastopexy</span> was performed in 41 percent, augmentation or implant exchange was performed in 18 percent, myocutaneous flaps were performed in 17 percent, local procedures such as fat grafting were performed in 14 percent, and contralateral reduction mammaplasty was performed in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H689804341\" class=\"local\">'Reconstruction following oncoplastic surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal management of women who have undergone mastectomy for breast cancer requires a collaborative effort between oncologic and reconstructive surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists, as well as medical oncologists. This multimodality approach allows providers to coordinate cancer and reconstructive procedures with the need for radiation therapy and chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A productive, caring relationship is crucial to patient satisfaction with the reconstructive process and must be established early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer may have feelings of grief and anger as well as unrealistic expectations that may be directed toward her healthcare team. If possible, the patient's family should be included in the consultation. </p><p>At the initial consultation, educational literature, including preoperative and postoperative photographs of patients who have undergone reconstruction, is helpful for the patient to aid the decision-making process. Peer-reviewed internet sites (eg, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society) are a useful resource for information on breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The opportunity to speak with other women who have undergone breast reconstruction may also be worthwhile.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1835666836\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough medical history should focus on the following factors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage of disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment plan (including likelihood for postmastectomy radiotherapy) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past surgical history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume and shape of the contralateral breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body habitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential donor sites for autologous reconstruction</p><p/><p>A past medical history of radiation therapy or current disease extent for which radiation therapy is mandated may impact the patient's reconstructive options. (See <a href=\"#H2464163\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy and timing of breast reconstruction'</a> below.)</p><p>Comorbidities such as obesity, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, thrombophilia, and connective tissue disease may also influence reconstructive options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. When poorly controlled, these comorbidities may increase the risk for complications such as impaired wound healing, reduced tissue perfusion, and infection. Likewise, past surgical histories that include open cholecystectomy, abdominoplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting (with use of internal mammary vessels) may limit reconstructive choices because of their adverse effects on the blood supply to autologous tissues at potential donor sites.</p><p>Tobacco users are at a significantly greater risk for developing surgical complications, particularly related to autologous (natural) tissue reconstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. In one series, compared with nonsmokers, smokers who underwent a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap reconstruction had significantly higher rates of mastectomy skin flap necrosis (19 versus 9 percent), donor site complications (26 versus 14 percent), and TRAM flap necrosis (4.4 versus 0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There were no significant differences in complication rates between nonsmokers and former smokers. For this reason, many surgeons consider active smoking to represent a contraindication to TRAM flap reconstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction#H1826540367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Pedicled TRAM flap'</a>.) </p><p>Tobacco use also poses significant risks to women considering prosthetic reconstruction. In these patients, mastectomy skin flap necrosis due to the nicotine effect, as well as generalized tissue hypoxia due to the carbon monoxide, can increase the risks of tissue necrosis, delayed healing, and infection. For these reasons, avoidance of tobacco products and nicotine products, including electronic cigarettes, is recommended for at least four weeks prior to surgery and two weeks following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. </p><p>Breast reconstruction in overweight and obese patients also presents a challenge for plastic surgeons. Previous studies have reported higher complication rates and disappointing aesthetic results in this population compared with normal-weight women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/40,47-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,47-54</a>]. In a multicenter, prospective analysis comparing complication rates of expander-implant and TRAM reconstructions, higher body mass index was associated with a greater likelihood of postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Free-flap breast reconstruction in obese patients is associated with a high risk of total flap loss, major postoperative complications, and delayed abdominal wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H827557647\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of the breasts includes an evaluation for volume, ptosis, asymmetry, and scars, and the axilla examined for palpably abnormal lymph nodes. If radiation therapy has been administered previously, the quality of the breast and chest wall soft tissues must be assessed. The abdomen, back, and buttocks are evaluated as possible donor sites, taking note of scars, overall fat content, skin laxity, and abdominal wall strength. Potential asymmetry between the native contralateral breast and the newly reconstructed breast must be addressed. The contralateral breast may require a reconstructive procedure, such as mastopexy, reduction, or even augmentation (breast implant placement), in order to obtain symmetry. The patient's personal distribution of excess skin and fat are also considered, because they dictate whether a given reconstructive choice can provide enough tissue volume to recreate a breast. Finally, the patient's wishes regarding scar location, tissue sacrifice, postoperative recovery, and aesthetic outcome are also important in guiding the reconstructive surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H44798710\" class=\"local\">'Other procedures'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of breast reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast reconstruction can be carried out at the time of the mastectomy (immediate) or during a subsequent operation (delayed). Immediate reconstruction can be offered to most patients. However, patients should be informed that if perfusion to the skin flaps is compromised following mastectomy, a delayed reconstruction will be necessary. Delayed reconstruction is sometimes more appropriate for patients who will need postmastectomy radiation for locally advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H2464163\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy and timing of breast reconstruction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173461702\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opinion within the surgical community regarding immediate breast reconstruction has evolved over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Initially, delayed procedures were favored because it was assumed that the time between mastectomy and reconstruction provided women with the opportunity to &quot;psychologically adjust&quot; to the loss of a breast, therefore allowing for a greater appreciation for their reconstruction. This assumption was found to be faulty when several studies revealed that women undergoing immediate reconstruction experienced significant psychosocial benefits. It is our belief that immediate reconstruction provides at least some &quot;buffer&quot; from the psychological and body image disturbances associated with a breast cancer diagnosis and mastectomy.</p><p>The <strong>advantages</strong> of immediate reconstruction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgical process is streamlined, since removal of the breast cancer and reconstruction are done in one operative setting. As a result, the overall cost of the reconstructive process is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulating data support the view that immediate breast reconstruction provides substantial psychosocial benefits over delayed reconstruction and preserves normal perceptions of body image in women undergoing mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/5,58-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,58-64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal breast landmarks (such as the inframammary fold) are preserved with immediate reconstruction.

Radiation therapy leads to fibrosis, which compromises the quality of the skin and underlying tissue, results in a higher incidence of complications from the reconstructive procedure, and may produce a less aesthetically pleasing result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. For women who will need postmastectomy radiation, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines advise women undergoing implant reconstruction to undergo initial reconstruction with an expander, and for women undergoing autologous reconstruction delaying surgery after completion of radiation therapy to avoid fibrosis and compromised cosmesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, no significant differences in complication rates were seen in a study comparing postmastectomy radiation after tissue expander placement with postmastectomy radiation after exchange for a permanent implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The effects of radiation therapy on implant and autologous flap reconstruction are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H697193552\" class=\"local\">'Impact of radiation therapy on implants'</a> below and <a href=\"#H697194034\" class=\"local\">'Impact of radiation therapy on flap reconstruction'</a> below.) </p><p>The best method of integrating radiation therapy into any method of reconstruction is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The need for postmastectomy radiation therapy often cannot be determined definitively until the final pathologic evaluation is complete (typically three to five days following mastectomy). A number of approaches have been suggested to circumvent this problem and permit suitable patients who have a low likelihood of needing postmastectomy radiation therapy to undergo immediate reconstruction, if they desire it. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One approach is to perform a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy prior to mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. If the SLNs are tumor-free, then the likelihood that postmastectomy radiation therapy will be needed is low (but not zero), and immediate reconstruction can be considered. (See <a href=\"#H173461702\" class=\"local\">'Immediate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative approach is the &quot;delayed-immediate&quot; reconstruction approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The first stage consists of a skin-sparing mastectomy with subpectoral insertion of a filled tissue expander to preserve the shape and dimensions of the breast envelope. After a review of the permanent histologic sections, patients who do not need postmastectomy radiation therapy then undergo a &quot;delayed-immediate&quot; reconstruction within two weeks of mastectomy. Those who require radiation therapy undergo it with the expander deflated on the chest wall to optimize treatment delivery, followed by delayed reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Early results with this approach have been promising, but radiation therapy-related tissue expander complications may still require interruption of postmastectomy radiation therapy, with the associated risk of compromising oncologic outcomes. More research on breast reconstruction in irradiated patients is needed to determine optimal management in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H173461709\" class=\"local\">'Delayed'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44799897\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing the type of reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction offers significant quality-of-life benefits and is a vital option to enhance breast cancer recovery. With the variety of reconstructive techniques available, choosing the &quot;right&quot; option can sometimes be a daunting task, even for highly educated consumers. Considerations include patient preference, body habitus, and prior surgical procedures. Age alone should not discourage breast reconstruction. Older women who undergo breast reconstruction following mastectomy have similar outcomes and may have better breast-related quality of life outcomes compared with those who do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].</p><p>Breast reconstruction following a mastectomy can be performed using a prosthetic device (eg, breast implant) or autologous tissue (eg, transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous), or a combination of a prosthesis and autologous reconstruction (eg, latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with an implant). Most women will be considered a reasonable candidate for either. However, some women are clearly a better candidate for one approach over another, based upon individual body habitus, previous breast-related surgery or radiation, or personal choice. (See <a href=\"#H44798653\" class=\"local\">'Techniques for breast reconstruction'</a> above.) </p><p>The ideal patient characteristics for autologous tissue reconstruction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ample tissue at the desired donor site, eg, at the abdomen, posterior thorax, gluteal region, or thigh. The most commonly considered donor site is the abdomen. The benefits of using abdominal tissue are the ability to ford and shape the tissues to recreate the breast, as well as contouring the abdomen for an abdominoplasty-type effect. The other donor sites listed are usually secondary sites and associated with a lesser amount of tissue and these are sometimes used in conjunction with an implant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal history of previous radiation to the breast. Because of the local tissue effects of radiation therapy, autologous tissue options are preferred over implant-based techniques in previously irradiated patients. It is recommended to wait 6 to 12 months following radiation to perform a microvascular anastomosis, when considering microvascular reconstruction using the abdominal, gluteal, or thigh donor sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H697193552\" class=\"local\">'Impact of radiation therapy on implants'</a> below and <a href=\"#H697194034\" class=\"local\">'Impact of radiation therapy on flap reconstruction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple scars on the breast &ndash; The scarred breast may pose challenges when considering mastectomy and reconstruction. Poorly placed biopsy scars may compromise prosthetic reconstruction because of the risk of skin necrosis. When planning a breast biopsy, it is important to place scars along aesthetic units that include the periareolar region and radially when along the periphery of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. With autologous reconstruction, the scarred skin can be excised and replaced with skin from the donor flap. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral mastectomies and any of the above characteristics.</p><p/><p>The ideal patient characteristics for prosthetic reconstruction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body mass index (BMI) &lt;30 &ndash; Although less desirable, some patients with a BMI in excess of 30 may still be candidates for prosthetic reconstruction.

The complexities can be difficult to comprehend during a time when many patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer have stress and anxiety. During this time, a rapport is established between the reconstructive team and the patient. Following the initial history and physical examination, patient-specific recommendations are made for breast reconstruction that may include prosthetic reconstruction, autologous reconstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oncoplastic reconstruction. An in-depth discussion regarding appropriate timing for reconstruction is essential to optimize outcomes and minimize the potential for postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Although patient satisfaction with postmastectomy reconstruction remains high in obese patients, these patients should be counseled preoperatively regarding their higher complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Following the surgeon's initial discussion with the patient regarding the options for breast reconstruction, it is generally considered good practice to have a nurse or mid-level provider review the information discussed and assist in answering any additional questions. This approach can be less intimidating for many patients and is often very effective in alleviating the patient's fears and anxiety. It also can be useful to show patients drawings, videos, and preoperative and postoperative photographs of the results of the specific reconstructive procedures. One important aspect of the initial consultation for the surgeon is to understand what the patient's expectations are and whether or not they are realistic, and to address them with the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44799266\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postoperative care of a patient following prosthetic or autologous reconstruction is important. Early ambulation is recommended to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and to improve pulmonary function. It is common for patients to experience incisional pain and muscle spasm, which can be alleviated with narcotics and muscle relaxing medications. Postoperative oral antibiotics may be prescribed based on need. Patients are instructed to refrain from strenuous activity for four to six weeks to allow for optimal wound healing and to reduce the risk of a seroma or contour abnormality at the donor site. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following prosthetic reconstruction, a drain is typically placed in the prosthetic space and will remain for several days. Most patients are allowed to shower on postoperative day two or three. When a tissue expander is placed, patients typically are expanded in the office or clinic at one to two week intervals until complete.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following autologous reconstruction, most patients are typically admitted for three to four days in the hospital. Surgical drains may be placed in the reconstructed breast and the donor site. The duration of drainage is variable. Abdominal and gluteal drains are usually removed in one week; whereas latissimus dorsi drains are removed at two to three weeks because of the risk for seroma. Patients are instructed to shower on postoperative day three and to follow up with the surgeon a few days following discharge from the hospital. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H697194241\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of radiation therapy in the context of breast reconstruction is discussed above.

The end-results of the complex tissue changes induced by radiation include scar formation at the <span class=\"nowrap\">implant/tissue</span> interface, capsular contracture, and impaired skin healing. Other complications associated with implant reconstruction include implant rupture or extrusion, and implant malpositioning.

However, radiation therapy may have more of a negative effect on health-related quality of life and satisfaction with implant breast reconstruction. Based upon a multicenter cross-sectional BREAST-Q survey of women with implant reconstruction (n = 633), women undergoing radiation therapy (n = 219) were less likely to be satisfied with the results compared with women without radiation treatments (66.8 versus 71.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In addition, women undergoing radiation treatment also scored lower for psychosocial well-being (66.7 versus 70.9 percent), sexual well-being (47.0 versus 52.3 percent), and physical well-being (71.8 versus 75.1 percent). The impact of the diagnosis or clinical setting that required the addition of radiation therapy, rather than the results of the radiation treatments on the reconstructed breast, needs to be further evaluated. </p><p>However, in a separate study, radiation therapy did not affect patient satisfaction scores, but was associated with an increased rate of breast implant removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. A cohort study comparing outcomes among 40 women who had reconstruction with an implant in the setting of radiation therapy with 40 others who were not irradiated showed that capsular contraction rates among the women who did and did not receive radiation therapy were 33 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Nineteen of the 40 irradiated breasts ultimately needed addition of, or replacement by, autologous tissue to salvage the reconstruction. Similar rates have been found in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p>Not all studies associate poor <span class=\"nowrap\">cosmetic/aesthetic</span> outcomes with women who undergo immediate implant reconstruction followed by radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/89-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-92</a>]. A cohort study that included 725 women (754 reconstructed breasts) undergoing breast cancer reconstruction with implants found that the five-year implant failure rate was 10.4 percent for nonradiated implants (n = 386), 28.2 percent for implants placed after prior radiation (n = 64), and 25.2 percent for implants placed prior to radiation (n = 304) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The majority of women with none (86.2 percent), previous (68.6 percent), and postoperative (77.7 percent) radiation would encourage implant reconstruction for other women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H697194034\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of radiation therapy on flap reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the cases of autologous reconstruction, radiation may result in flap shrinkage and fibrosis.

In a retrospective study of 113 women who underwent postmastectomy radiotherapy and breast reconstruction, the complication rate was 32 percent for patients who had radiation first and 44 percent for patients who had breast reconstruction first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Early complications were seen more frequently in patients having radiation first while late complications were more common in patients who had breast reconstruction first. In another study comparing outcomes of 32 patients who underwent immediate transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap reconstruction followed by radiation therapy compared with 70 women who underwent radiation therapy and subsequent delayed flap reconstruction, the incidence of late complications was significantly higher in the immediate compared with the delayed reconstruction group (88 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Nine patients (28 percent) in the immediate reconstruction group required an additional flap to correct contour deformities resulting from flap shrinkage and contracture.</p><p>Transferring nonirradiated tissue to the mastectomy site may avoid some of the radiation-associated wound healing complications. Tissues severely damaged by radiation therapy can be resected and discarded at the time of the reconstruction, and the skin &quot;paddle&quot; of the designed flap can be tailored to replace the missing breast surface skin. In general, prior radiation therapy increases the amount of tissue required for breast reconstruction, and this may limit flap selection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44799375\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-treatment surveillance of the reconstructed breast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following mastectomy, the reconstructed breast is at risk for a chest wall recurrence, and less often, a second primary breast cancer. Even after the most aggressive mastectomies, some small amount of normal residual breast tissue remains and presents a risk for a subsequent new primary breast cancer. Thus, several authors have suggested that screening might be of value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Although guidelines from expert groups for the follow-up of breast cancer patients recommend annual mammography, these recommendations do <strong>not</strong> apply to women who have undergone mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/70,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,103</a>]. Physical examination remains the cornerstone of detection of recurrent breast cancer after reconstruction with other modalities (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], ultrasound, mammography) used as adjuncts to clarify any physical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Detection rates of chest wall recurrence and outcomes are not significantly affected by reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>Recurrent cancers can occur either right below the skin (most common) in the subcutaneous tissue or just over the pectoralis muscle. Given that most surgeons remove the pectoralis fascia with the mastectomy specimen, recurrence on the chest wall is less common than subcutaneous tissue recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Proliferation of any residual breast cell will often present as a &quot;pimple&quot; under the skin. If there is high suspicion of a chest wall recurrence in the setting of reconstruction, a breast MRI may be helpful.</p><p>While mammography is technically feasible following autologous myocutaneous flap reconstruction, particularly following TRAM or perforator flap reconstruction, abdominal adipose tissue forms the bulk of the reconstructed breast, but breast cancers do not occur de novo in abdominal tissue. In addition, fat necrosis can appear radiographically as calcifications in reconstructed breast tissue, leading to unnecessary biopsy procedures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes data on surgical complications, physical function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction provide the surgeon and patient with useful information when choosing the most appropriate reconstructive technique and timing.

Psychologic support should be offered to all women diagnosed with breast cancer, regardless of surgical procedure (breast conserving or mastectomy with or without reconstruction) offered. In a study from Toronto, Canada, it was demonstrated that immediate breast reconstruction may protect breast cancer patients from a period of psychosocial distress, poor body image, and diminished sexual well-being compared with women waiting for delayed breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H173461702\" class=\"local\">'Immediate'</a> above.)</p><p>It is challenging to accurately compare the psychosocial impact of the various surgical procedures, as some women who are candidates for breast conserving surgery opt for mastectomy, and some who are candidates for reconstruction opt for none.

This was illustrated in the Michigan Breast Reconstruction Outcomes Study project, which measured patient satisfaction with regard to aesthetic result (softness, symmetry) and general satisfaction with the process and outcome of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/59,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,112</a>]. </p><p>At one year following surgery, women with pedicled TRAM flaps, free TRAM flaps, and <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implants</span> had similar levels of general satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], but autologous tissue reconstructions (TRAM procedures) were associated with greater aesthetic satisfaction than <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> techniques. At year two, these procedural differences had diminished, but patients continued to be more aesthetically satisfied with autologous tissue compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> reconstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. At postoperative year two, the percentages of patients aesthetically satisfied in the <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant,</span> pedicled TRAM, and free TRAM groups were 43, 69, and 70 percent, respectively. With regard to general satisfaction, the percentages of patients who were satisfied with their procedure were 64, 79, and 78 percent, respectively.</p><p>Even after controlling for possible confounding factors, such as preoperative physical function and timing of surgery, patients with TRAM flaps (both free and pedicle) had higher levels of aesthetic satisfaction at year two as compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.8, p &lt;0.01). </p><p>There were no significant differences in aesthetic satisfaction between women with free and pedicle TRAM flaps, a finding which has been noted by other investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical functioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The variability in the degree of muscle that is sacrificed, denervated, or injured in creating abdominal wall flaps for breast reconstruction makes the comparison of abdominal wall function after abdominal flap reconstruction challenging. Several studies have evaluated abdominal function using basic physical functioning tests such as getting out of bed and the ability to perform sit-ups, although more sensitive testing of muscle function, such as isokinetic dynamometry, which measures the maximum strength a muscle can reach, may be necessary for accurate comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/115-117\" class=\"abstract_t\">115-117</a>]. </p><p>Many patients are concerned about potential abdominal wall morbidity with TRAM procedures. Physical functioning following free or pedicled TRAM flap reconstructive surgery depends upon whether the reconstruction was unilateral or bilateral, whether the motor innervation to the rectus abdominis muscles was sacrificed or preserved, and the degree of postoperative fibrosis occurring within the remaining muscle. In general, for most women who require unilateral reconstruction, breast reconstruction with a pedicle TRAM flap will not make a significant impact on the activities of daily living. However, for women who need bilateral reconstruction, perforator or muscle sparing flaps may confer an advantage in physical function. In a review of 20 studies of abdominal wall function following breast reconstruction, bilateral reconstruction was associated with the greatest difficulty in performing some daily activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. However, unilateral reconstruction did not affect the performance of activities of daily living.</p><p>Functional outcomes studies have shown mixed results, with between 6 and 23 percent of patients demonstrating deficits in trunk function (eg, torque and range of motion) following TRAM reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. However, these are largely single-center studies without long-term follow-up. Physical function outcomes data are especially important as more technically complex procedures, such as perforator flaps, are being increasingly performed to limit the surgical &quot;insult&quot; to the abdominal wall. In the Michigan Breast Reconstruction Outcomes Study, data on trunk peak torque and range of motion were collected preoperatively and at postoperative years one and two in the <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant,</span> free TRAM, and pedicled TRAM groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. At two years postoperatively, procedure type, timing, and laterality (unilateral versus bilateral) did not significantly affect the range of motion for trunk flexion or extension. Peak torque for trunk flexion at year two was significantly lower (by 11 to 18 percent) in patients with TRAM flaps compared with those undergoing <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> reconstructions. However, no significant difference in flexion peak torque was found between patients who had free and pedicle TRAM reconstructions. These data are consistent with other contemporary breast reconstruction functional outcomes studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">122-124</a>].</p><p>The available outcomes data on perforator flaps are limited to retrospective reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/125-128\" class=\"abstract_t\">125-128</a>]. One study evaluated the ability of patients to do sit-ups at three and six months following perforator flap reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. At three months, 95 percent of women were able to return to their preoperative sit-up activity; this was 100 percent by six months postoperatively. Another retrospective series evaluated abdominal wall function in 18 patients with deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps compared with free TRAM reconstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. The TRAM group appeared to have significantly lower trunk flexion torque compared with the DIEP group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two general types of reconstructive procedures: prosthetic devices (eg, tissue expanders, saline implants, silicone implants) and autologous tissue reconstruction, which involves the transfer of a flap of tissue from a donor site to the anterior chest wall. The choice of the reconstructive option depends upon a variety of factors including body habitus, associated comorbidity (eg, obesity, history of diabetes, smoking), the size and configuration of the contralateral breast, prior surgical procedures, the quality of the chest wall skin, and patient choice. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast reconstruction is often performed immediately after mastectomy. The advantages of immediate reconstruction include streamlined care, reduced cost, superior cosmetic results, and psychosocial benefits. Immediate reconstruction may be considered in patients who are undergoing mastectomy for prophylaxis, ductal carcinoma in situ, or for invasive breast cancers less than 5 cm in size that are clinically axillary node-negative, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have a negative premastectomy sentinel node biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Timing of breast reconstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are likely to need postmastectomy radiation therapy, delayed reconstruction may be considered. Autologous tissue is typically preferred rather than an implant following radiation treatments since this approach provides an acceptable outcome with fewer post-radiation complications. (See <a href=\"#H697194241\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-breast-reconstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rowland JH, Desmond KA, Meyerowitz BE, et al.
