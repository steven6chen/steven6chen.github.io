Intensive care unit (ICU)-level management of these children entails the administration of glucocorticoids, aggressive bronchodilator therapy, and close monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) can help avoid the need for intubation in many patients who progress toward respiratory muscle fatigue by reducing the work of breathing until maximal therapeutic effects of pharmacotherapy take place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Intensive care unit management&quot;, section on 'Pharmacotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Intensive care unit management&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>Mechanical ventilation is reserved for patients with continued progression toward respiratory failure despite maximal medical therapy. The use of mechanical ventilation during an asthma exacerbation has associated morbidities, but mortality due to complications that occurred after ICU admission is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Mechanical ventilation rates for children with asthma vary from center to center, with published rates ranging from 1 percent to 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H344203926\" class=\"local\">'Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H344207165\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Intensive care unit management&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>The need for mechanical respiratory support and potential invasive ventilation should be considered early in the course of illness. The best way to avoid intubation is to rapidly escalate the preintubation therapies in patients with a worsening trajectory indicated by increased work of breathing or carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention. Several reports have shown that children intubated prior to ICU care are on mechanical ventilation for a shorter duration, most likely because the patients were intubated prior to intensive delivery of bronchodilators and glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>].

The decision to intubate a patient to prevent severe hypoxia should be made with great care since tracheal stimulation can worsen the asthma exacerbation and frequently worsens airway obstruction and hypercarbia. (See <a href=\"#H344206148\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Adjunctive therapies may be necessary for children who do not improve despite aggressive pharmacologic therapy and mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H344205485\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344202293\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe asthma require close cardiopulmonary monitoring, particularly those on mechanical ventilation. Supportive measures for children with asthma who require mechanical ventilation include analgesia, sedation, and potentially also muscle relaxation if a spontaneous breathing mode is not used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>]. These supportive measures help to prevent breath stacking and ventilator dyssynchrony, particularly in the setting of hypercapnia. Most patients are also given intravenous fluids to treat dehydration and prevent hypotension. Sedation and paralysis are reviewed below. Other supportive measures are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management#H1105464739\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Intensive care unit management&quot;, section on 'Supportive care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344202400\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation and paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of agents can be used for sedation for the patient with asthma who requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. The sedative agents that can be used for intubation include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etomidate</a>. Additionally, neuromuscular blocking agents may be used to optimize intubating conditions. Once patients are intubated, sedation is also used to promote <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/ventilator</span> synchrony and blunt tachypnea in order to reduce the risk of barotrauma.</p><p>Of the sedative agents that are available to facilitate intubation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> is most commonly used. Ketamine, a synthetic derivative of phencyclidine, is often recommended as the induction agent of choice for the asthma patient requiring intubation because it has bronchodilatory as well as sedative effects. Ketamine also has been administered as a continuous infusion in patients receiving invasive or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When used in this fashion, a loading dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is followed by an infusion of 20 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The evidence in support of use of ketamine in children is limited. In one study, improvements were seen in the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> ratio in all patients studied, and dynamic compliance, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>), and peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) improved in those mechanically ventilated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

It is a potent <span class=\"nowrap\">hypnotic/anesthetic</span> agent that accomplishes global central nervous system depression via activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Propofol decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen consumption and reduces intracranial pressure. In addition, it is reported to have anti-inflammatory properties and to dilate central airways. For this reason, it is commonly used to facilitate intubation in patients with status asthmaticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There are documented reports of propofol-induced bronchoconstriction in some patients with atopy and drug-induced asthma but bronchodilation in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Unlike <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, for which there is no prohibition against prolonged use in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), prolonged use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> is associated with propofol infusion syndrome that includes cardiac and renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. It occurs more commonly in children and in critically ill patients treated with glucocorticoids and catecholamines and thus carries a boxed warning by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against its use for sedation in the PICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Nonetheless, several studies published subsequently have demonstrated the safe use of propofol for sedation in over 500 PICU patients, suggesting that propofol can be at doses &lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/hour</span> for under 48 hours in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>A broad range of medications are also available to sedate the already intubated pediatric patient with asthma. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fentanyl</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> in combination are commonly used in the PICU setting to accomplish sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Dexmedetomidine</a>, a selective alpha-2-receptor agonist, is approved for use for up to 24 hours in the adult population. There are multiple reports of its safety and efficacy in the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Dosing is largely extrapolated from the adult literature. Patients are typically loaded with 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> over 10 to 20 minutes, but some pediatric centers reduce or eliminate the loading dose in an effort to avoid hypotension and bradycardia, the two most commonly encountered adverse effects in the pediatric population. The available literature espouses an infusion dose range from 0.2 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour,</span> but the pediatric literature suggests that doses as high as 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour</span> can be used safely. In addition to sedation for the ventilated patient, dexmedetomidine is also used to facilitate tolerance of NPPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Neuromuscular blockade may be employed as an adjunct to intubation and to blunt tachypnea and ventilator dyssynchrony in sedated patients receiving assisted ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, efforts should be made to discontinue the use of neuromuscular blocking agents as soon as is feasible since their use in combination with glucocorticoids is associated with an increased risk of myopathy of critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/4,24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24-30</a>]. In addition, pressure support cannot be used in a paralyzed patient. Spontaneous breathing modes of mechanical ventilation are generally more comfortable and use substantially lower peak airway pressures. (See <a href=\"#H344204295\" class=\"local\">'Pressure support'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-of-the-operating-room-in-children-medications-for-sedation-and-paralysis#H2175222855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside of the operating room in children: Medications for sedation and paralysis&quot;, section on 'Paralytic agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344203926\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION AND MECHANICAL VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intubation should be approached cautiously in patients with status asthmaticus because manipulation of the airway can cause increased airflow obstruction due to exaggerated bronchial responsiveness. Adequate venous access, frequent noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and sedation should be optimized before intubation. The clinician most experienced with airway management should perform the intubation.

The patient should be given breaths with a bag and in-line manometer prior to initiating mechanical ventilation. Careful noting of the seconds needed for expiration to finish is important to avoid breath stacking, auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and increased end expiratory lung volume that increase the risk of barotrauma and compromise cardiac function by increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. The respiratory rate (RR) on the ventilator should be sufficiently low so that a normal inspiratory time can be provided in addition to an expiratory time that emulates the time ascertained while hand ventilating the child. (See <a href=\"#H344206148\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344204115\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate oxygenation is usually achieved without difficulty in most patients with asthma since the airways, not the alveoli, are the primary targets of inflammation and bronchospasm. However, mucus plugging, atelectasis, hyperinflation, and <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatch may contribute to hypoxemia. Oxygenation is affected primarily by the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>). (See <a href=\"#H344204773\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator settings'</a> below.)</p><p>Atelectasis that results from mucus plugging can usually be treated with judicious application of PEEP, as well as regular removal of secretions from the endotracheal tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, positioning of the patient so that collapsed lung segments are nondependent helps to improve atelectasis.</p><p>If these measures prove insufficient, extrinsic PEEP above initial PEEP (3 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is suggested) may be carefully applied. The titration of PEEP also may be helpful in recruiting atelectatic lung units. Hyperinflation, however, by generating more zone I physiology (where alveolar pressure exceeds pulmonary arterial pressure), may produce <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch and therefore worsen hypoxemia.

The risk of hyperinflation is reduced by decreasing the minute volume and permitting adequate time for complete exhalation before the next inhalation is initiated. This is accomplished by slowing the RR and increasing the expiratory time while keeping a normal inspiratory time, thereby decreasing the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory time (I:E ratio) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The risk of barotrauma is decreased by minimizing hyperinflation and peak inspiratory pressures (PIP). For these reasons, many consider pressure support ventilation (PSV) the ideal mode of ventilation for the intubated patient with asthma, but there is no evidence to support one mode of ventilation over another. (See <a href=\"#H344204773\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator settings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H344206382\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic hyperinflation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H344206701\" class=\"local\">'Barotrauma'</a> below.)</p><p>Diminishing the risk of hyperinflation and barotrauma requires acceptance of an initial PaCO<sub>2</sub> that is higher than normal with an accompanying respiratory acidosis, a strategy that is called &quot;permissive hypercapnia&quot; or &quot;controlled hypoventilation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. A slow increase in PaC0<sub>2</sub> (approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmHg/hour)</span> permits intracellular buffering mechanisms to accommodate the decreasing serum pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This strategy is widely used in patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/36,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38-40</a>]. Permissive hypercarbia is well tolerated by children with normal cardiac function. However, those with concurrent chronic conditions, such as cyanotic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary hypertension, will probably not tolerate this strategy. Other potential contraindications to permissive hypercapnic ventilation include increased intracranial pressure, poor myocardial function, and coexistent metabolic acidosis (eg, patients with renal disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344204187\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilatory modes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of ventilatory modes have been successfully employed in the management of patients with asthma who require intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/9,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,41</a>].

The ventilator used to deliver these agents must have a scavenger system to prevent staff exposure to the anesthetic agents. Their mechanisms of action are unknown but are purported to include direct smooth muscle relaxation, reduction of vagal tone, and synergy with catecholamines. Inhalation anesthetics can generate hypotension. Delivery in some pediatric intensive care units (PICU) may be difficult given lack of familiarity with anesthesia machines by pediatric intensivists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>].

Patients with an acute severe asthma exacerbation are at risk for progressive airtrapping and alveolar hyperinflation, which may lead to alveolar rupture and hemodynamic compromise. Endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation in the child with asthma can be associated with significant morbidity including hypotension, barotrauma (including pneumothorax), and myopathy. These complications occur in 10 to 26 percent of children who are ventilated for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/5,36,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,36,56</a>], and more than one-half of complications occur during or immediately after intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Expansion of lung volume may increase airway caliber and can reduce the resistive work of breathing. However, this physiologic response becomes maladaptive in patients with severe asthma because it increases mechanical load and elastic work of breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Obstruction to expiratory airflow may lead to initiation of inspiration before the preceding exhalation is complete (ie, before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume leaving lung volume above functional residual capacity [FRC]). This phenomenon is called dynamic hyperinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Dynamic hyperinflation increases the magnitude of the drop in airway pressure that the patient must generate to trigger a breath, thereby increasing the patient's workload (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64640 \">figure 1</a>). It can also cause alveolar overdistention resulting in hypoxemia, hypotension, or alveolar rupture. Dynamic hyperinflation can occur in patients with asthma who are breathing spontaneously, but it is more common, and potentially more difficult to manage, in ventilated patients due to the use of positive pressure.</p><p>There are several ways to assess for the presence of dynamic hyperinflation. These include measurement of the end inspiratory plateau pressure (Pplat), end-inspired volume (VEI) above apneic functional residual capacity, or intrinsic or auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The Pplat measure is obtained by pausing ventilation briefly (0.4 seconds) at end inspiration and measuring the airway pressure. Keeping Pplat below 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O can decrease complications. Whether this measure is valid in children is unknown. The latter two measurements have limitations and are less commonly used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive mechanical ventilation in adults with acute exacerbations of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interventions to correct airtrapping include decreasing the respiratory rate (RR; functionally increasing expiratory time), increasing inspiratory flow rates (functionally decreasing the inspiratory time), and lowering the tidal volume (TV).

Barotrauma occurs when the transalveolar pressure increases to a degree that disrupts the structural integrity of the alveolus. This leads to alveolar rupture and interstitial emphysema. A pneumothorax results if the interstitial emphysema dissects along perivascular sheaths into the mediastinum and then the mediastinal parietal pleura ruptures.

This risk is increased in patients with asthma who are mechanically ventilated. The hyperinflation that is intrinsic to asthma and the increased intrathoracic pressure associated with positive-pressure ventilation impede venous return to the heart. This effect may be compounded by the administration of sedatives and paralytics, which act as vasodilators and myocardial depressants. (See <a href=\"#H344202400\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and paralysis'</a> above.)</p><p>Several steps can be taken to minimize the risk of hypotension in patients with asthma who require mechanical ventilation. These include measures to limit peak pressure and avoid hyperinflation, as described above. Patients also may benefit from the administration of intravenous fluids to improve and optimize intravascular volume. Optimization of intravascular volume may help to blunt the tachycardia that results from vasodilation associated with systemic absorption of bronchodilators. (See <a href=\"#H344206382\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic hyperinflation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management#H1105464836\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Intensive care unit management&quot;, section on 'Fluid support'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians caring for children with acute severe asthma exacerbation who require mechanical ventilation should be prepared to provide volume resuscitation if necessary. An extreme measure that can be taken if blood pressure fails to respond to volume resuscitation is to transiently disconnect the patient from the ventilator or manual resuscitator (bag valve mask or Ambu bag). This permits complete evacuation of the lung and, in turn, appropriate filling of the heart.

Care must be taken to control the airway before the patient suffers a respiratory arrest or a hypoxic insult. The clinician most experienced with airway management should perform the intubation. (See <a href=\"#H344204005\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful mechanical ventilation in patients with asthma depends upon limiting the risk of hyperinflation and barotrauma. This requires acceptance of an initial partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) that is higher than normal with an accompanying respiratory acidosis, a strategy called &quot;permissive hypercapnia&quot; or &quot;controlled hypoventilation.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H14579420\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator settings should be adjusted as necessary to maintain adequate exhalation, as assessed by chest auscultation and measurement of arterial blood gases, and to prevent complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77503 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H344204773\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator settings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive measures that help to prevent tachypnea, breath stacking, and ventilator dyssynchrony include analgesia, sedation, and paralysis. To minimize the risk of myopathy, neuromuscular blocking agents should be discontinued as soon as is feasible. (See <a href=\"#H344202400\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and paralysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive therapies, such as general anesthesia or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are rarely needed for patients who do not respond to aggressive pharmacologic therapy and mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H344205485\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications can result from the asthma exacerbation itself or the treatments.
