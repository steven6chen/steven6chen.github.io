In a large retrospective study of 67,160 patients who underwent BDRR, 2.5 percent of procedures were performed for congenital anomalies, 37.4 percent for malignant neoplasms, 2.3 percent for benign neoplasms, 9.9 percent for biliary injuries, and 47.9 percent for other nonmalignant diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bile-duct-resection-and-reconstruction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94431\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BDRR can be performed for various forms of cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma (extrahepatic and intrahepatic), hepatocellular carcinoma, and metastatic disease to the liver or the porta hepatis (rare). Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and tumors at the biliary bifurcation may require concomitant liver resection with BDRR. Pancreatic cancer or periampullary cancers involving the distal common bile duct are generally treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple operation).

For laparoscopic procedures, the standard laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic approaches to the right upper quadrant can be adopted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111814270\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide Kocher maneuver is performed to expose the duodenum and is continued cephalad to expose the right side of the porta hepatis. A plastic endobiliary stent or a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiocatheter placed preoperatively can aid in identification of the bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. </p><p>The gallbladder, if intact, is removed from the gallbladder fossa but left attached to the bile duct specimen by the cystic duct for anatomic identification and for adherence to principles of oncologic resection (in malignant cases). Alternatively, if there is no stent in the bile duct, the gallbladder can be removed and a cholangiocatheter passed down the cystic duct to the bile duct and into the duodenum for easier identification of the ampulla of Vater (for distal bile duct or ampullary lesions).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94516\"><span class=\"h2\">Resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The resection techniques vary based upon the location of the lesion. Ampullary lesions are typically resected transduodenally. More proximal lesions such as mid-bile-duct lesions are typically removed by a segmental bile duct excision with or without concomitant liver or pancreatic resection, depending on the margin status of the biliary resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111814282\"><span class=\"h3\">Ampullary resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ampullary resection is usually performed to remove ampullary tumors and rarely performed for ampullary strictures. With the duodenum intact, the ampulla of Vater is first searched for by intraoperative ultrasound or by palpation of a tumor or a biliary stent. If the ampulla can be located in this fashion, the duodenum is opened transversely to minimize narrowing of the lumen after closure. If the ampulla cannot be located prior to duodenotomy, a longitudinal incision on the duodenum allows for extension cephalad or caudad as necessary until the ampulla is found.</p><p>In patients with ampullary tumors, normal mucosa surrounding the tumor is identified and marked circumferentially using electrocautery with a gross margin of 3 mm. Fine (5-0) absorbable sutures can be placed circumferentially around the tumor for traction and to mark the &quot;staying&quot; duodenum. The tumor is then excised using electrocautery, along with full-thickness resection of the ampulla around the biliary stent. As dissection deepens, more sutures are placed circumferentially, until the structures of the bile duct and pancreatic duct become clearly identified and divided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103521\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103521 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The specimen is removed, after which orifices of the biliary and pancreatic duct are reimplanted in the back wall of the duodenum with interrupted 5-0 sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103523 \">figure 2</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Secretin</a>, which induces pancreatic secretion, can be used when necessary to identify the pancreatic duct. Careful identification of the pancreatic duct as well as the bile duct is necessary to avoid postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction, which can cause potentially fatal pancreatitis. A five French pediatric feeding tube can be used as a stent to protect the pancreatic duct orifice during reimplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bile-duct-resection-and-reconstruction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111814288\"><span class=\"h3\">Midportion bile duct resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mid-bile-duct resection is typically performed for potential bile duct cancers. </p><p>For tumors or lesions in the middle portion of the bile duct that do not grossly involve the hepatic bifurcation cephalad or the pancreas caudad, the surgeon should be able to identify uninvolved bile duct superior and inferior to the area of interest. In addition, the surgeon should also identify the common hepatic artery (generally to the patient's left of the bile duct), and the portal vein (posterior to the bile duct and common hepatic artery) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103682 \">figure 3</a>). The right hepatic artery generally passes posteriorly, but occasionally passes anteriorly, to the bile duct just above the cystic duct insertion, and is susceptible to injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103685 \">figure 4</a>). The use of intraoperative ultrasound for arterial and venous identification, as well as tumor assessment can help guide surgical dissection.</p><p>The bile duct is first transected inferiorly, so a frozen section of the inferior margin can be sent while the surgeon continues to dissect the bile duct and surrounding tissues off the portal vein and hepatic artery. For known or suspected malignant tumors, the nodal contents of the porta hepatis should be removed with the specimen en bloc or as a separate specimen. Subsequently, the specimen is divided at its superior margin, which is also sent for a frozen section. </p><p>If margins return positive or suspicious for cancer, the surgeon must decide if additional tissue can be removed safely. If the inferior margin is positive, a pancreatic resection (ie, a Whipple procedure) may be required; if the superior margin is positive, the hepatic bifurcation of the biliary tree may need to be resected with or without a hepatic resection, following which separate left and right hepatic reconstructions are required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22761287\"><span class=\"h3\">Perihilar resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal bile duct lesions close to or at the hepatic bifurcation are termed perihilar lesions. Most perihilar lesions are malignant (eg, Klatskin tumor). Resection techniques of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma are discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma#H102910681\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of localized cholangiocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22541972\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative frozen section analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative frozen section analyses are carried out on the resection margins to ensure complete resection. One should divide the bile duct sharply, as cautery artifact can interfere with pathology evaluation. In addition, the presence of biliary obstruction can also cause pathology to be equivocal during frozen section analyses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94535\"><span class=\"h2\">Reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following resection, bile duct reconstruction is typically accomplished by a Roux-en-Y biliary-enteric anastomosis, sometimes by anastomosing multiple bile ducts to the Roux limb. In patients with potentially devascularized high bile duct injuries, the Rodney Smith reconstruction is preferred. Direct end-to-end anastomosis of the extrahepatic bile duct is rarely successful because of stricturing. Choledochoduodenostomy, the direct anastomosis of the bile duct to the duodenum, was more widely utilized in the past, and maintains the gastrointestinal tract in its native position with one anastomosis. However, the presence of inflammation in the duodenum and porta hepatis may make tension-free anastomosis difficult, and reflux cholangitis can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bile-duct-resection-and-reconstruction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111814295\"><span class=\"h3\">Routine reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for bile duct reconstruction is the Roux-en-Y anastomosis (choledochojejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67421 \">figure 5</a>). In most patients whose bile duct has been transected, the anastomosis is performed superior to the takeoff of the cystic duct because of a better blood supply. In rare patients whose bile duct is left in continuity, a side-to-end biliary-enteric anastomosis can be fashioned at the most accessible level of the bile duct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94586\"><span class=\"h3\">Special reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy technique can be varied to accommodate special patient groups who require BDRR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465096\"><span class=\"h4\">Multiduct reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who have bile duct injuries from cholecystectomy or trauma, multiple biliary ducts may be injured. Each orifice will need to be anastomosed with the Roux limb, or the patient will suffer from biliary obstruction of the attendant liver segment(s). For patients with multiple duct injuries, preoperative placement of percutaneous transhepatic catheters into all obstructed ducts by interventional radiology can be critical. In the operating room, these catheters can be manipulated into the operative field for identification of the injured ducts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465102\"><span class=\"h4\">Hilar duct reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who sustain traumatic or iatrogenic injuries to the biliary tree can sometimes sustain a concomitant vascular injury to the right hepatic artery, which eliminates arterial blood supply to the hilar bile ducts. As a result, healing of a standard hepaticojejunal anastomosis is prevented. The Rodney Smith reconstruction is a sutureless technique for reconstruction of hilar bile ducts with a jejunal mucosal graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bile-duct-resection-and-reconstruction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It utilizes one or more indwelling interventional radiology catheters that are secured to the Roux limb to deliver a vascularized sleeve of jejunal mucosa into contact with epithelium of the bile duct. Postoperatively, the liver bed, bile ducts, and the jejunal Roux limb are allowed to adhere by fibrosis and scar formation, thereby completing the reconstruction. Postoperatively, catheter cholangiograms are obtained to confirm anastomotic patency before the catheters are gradually pulled back and eventually removed several months after the procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103669 \">figure 6</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111814320\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally invasive approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgeons are increasingly performing BDRR using minimally invasive methods, including laparoscopic, robotic, and hybrid techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bile-duct-resection-and-reconstruction/abstract/28-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-34</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimally invasive approach has been used for palliative bypass of unresectable periampullary cancers to offer patients a decreased length of stay and preserve their quality of life. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimally invasive approach has also been used in transduodenal resection of ampullary tumors with pancreatic and biliary duct reimplantation.

(See <a href=\"#H111814244\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile duct resection techniques vary based upon the location of the lesion. Ampullary lesions are typically resected transduodenally. More proximal lesions such as mid- or hilar bile duct lesions are typically removed by a segmental bile duct excision with or without concomitant liver or pancreatic resection, depending upon the margin status of the biliary resection. (See <a href=\"#H94516\" class=\"local\">'Resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile duct reconstruction is typically accomplished by a Roux-en-Y biliary-enteric anastomosis, sometimes by anastomosing multiple bile ducts to the Roux limb. In patients with devascularized hilar duct injuries, the use of a jejunal mucosal graft (ie, the Rodney Smith reconstruction) may be beneficial. Direct end-to-end anastomosis of the extrahepatic bile duct is rarely successful. (See <a href=\"#H94535\" class=\"local\">'Reconstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimally invasive techniques of bile duct resection and reconstruction are emerging. Palliative biliary bypass and transduodenal ampullary resection are the two most commonly performed laparoscopic biliary procedures. (See <a href=\"#H111814320\" class=\"local\">'Minimally invasive approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile duct resection and reconstruction procedures are associated with a perioperative mortality and morbidity rate of 4.2 percent and 32 percent, respectively. The most common early complications are bleeding and infection; potential late complications include stricture, liver atrophy, and disease recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H111814339\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bile-duct-resection-and-reconstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fatima J, Barton JG, Grotz TE, et al.
