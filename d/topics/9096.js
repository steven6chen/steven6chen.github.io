The patient has had a difficult night. He was intermittently hypotensive and is receiving pressors, including levarterenol. The glucose level rose transiently to values as high as 377 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (20.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> when hypotension developed but was subsequently maintained close to the target range, with glucose values since midnight in the 79 to 143 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 7.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range. The most recent glucose value is 117 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The patient's insulin requirement has varied markedly. When he became hypotensive, the requirement rose from 3 units an hour to 7 units an hour. It then fell to 4 units an hour as the blood pressure returned to normal.</p><p>Over the next two days, the patient improves. He is gradually weaned from pressors and the insulin requirement falls concomitantly. The glucose values remain in or close to the target range. The insulin infusion rate has been stable in the last 12 hours in the range of 2 units an hour.</p><p>You see the patient on morning rounds. The intensive care unit (ICU) team plans to transfer the patient to the postoperative cardiac surgical floor at approximately 8 PM when a bed is available and to stop the intravenous insulin infusion at that time.</p><p>You congratulate the ICU nurses and clinicians on their successful implementation of the insulin infusion protocol. You note that the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values indicate that the patient's diabetes was uncontrolled before admission on maximal doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, and you conclude that the patient will need a basal subcutaneous insulin regimen at the time of discharge from the hospital. You decide to initiate this in the ICU to facilitate determination of the dose before discharge from the hospital.</p><p>What do you recommend now?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You order glargine insulin 10 units at 10 PM and a sliding scale of aspart every six hours, starting with 2 units for a blood glucose of 201 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.2 to 13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and advancing by 2 unit increments for every 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> increment of blood glucose to 8 units of aspart for a blood glucose of 351 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (19.5 to 22.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.
