It is often associated with one or more of several articular and periarticular extraspinal features, including synovitis, enthesitis, and dactylitis. It may also be associated with several nonarticular features; these include uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients frequently carry the gene for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and patients with active inflammatory disease often have evidence of an elevated acute phase response.</p><p>Patients with axSpA can be classified as having either of two subtypes of axSpA: ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA). Patients with AS exhibit radiographic abnormalities consistent with sacroiliitis, but such findings are not evident on plain radiography in nr-axSpA. Instead, in patients with nr-axSpA, the diagnosis is supported by evidence of active inflammation of the sacroiliac (SI) joints on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by a combination of other findings, or both. In clinical practice, a distinction between these two forms of axSpA in an individual patient has limited impact on management and may not be relevant, although the classification is of value for epidemiologic and other investigative purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Historically, spondyloarthritis (SpA, formerly termed spondyloarthritides or spondyloarthropathies) has been regarded as a family of arthritis that includes AS; undifferentiated SpA; reactive arthritis; psoriatic arthritis; juvenile SpA; and arthritis and spondylitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Traditionally, AS has been regarded as the prototype of SpA, and the majority of publications prior to 2009 on SpA focus on AS.

In general, there is a clear correlation between the prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a given population and the prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 in that group, with the prevalence of AS being approximately 5 to 6 percent among people who are HLA-B27-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the United States, the prevalence of HLA-B27 varies among different ethnic communities; in a 2009 national survey, the prevalence rates of HLA-B27 in non-Hispanic whites, Mexican-Americans, and non-Hispanic Blacks were 7.5, 4.6, and 1.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>As an example of population data, in the 2009 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the general population in the United States, the prevalence of axSpA was 1.4 percent and the prevalence of AS was 0.55 percent, while the frequency of chronic low back pain in this cohort of 5103 United States adults aged 20 to 69 was 19.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

EAMs related to the concept of SpA are those that commonly occur in patients with axSpA (typically in 10 to 50 percent of patients), involve clinically evident inflammation, and can occur at any point during disease evolution. Sometimes the activity of the EAM may fluctuate with the axial or peripheral joint symptoms. Furthermore, the activity and course of the EAM, like the axial and peripheral articular and periarticular manifestations, can generally be modified by treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors. Acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and IBD are conditions considered SpA-related EAMs.</p><p>EAMs that are not considered related to the concept of SpA are rare (1 percent of patients) compared with related EAMs, are typically subclinical, occur in patients with longstanding disease, and are unrelated to joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Over the period of 12 years, approximately a quarter of the patients did not show any progression. By contrast, another quarter showed clinically important progression, such as having multiple new erosions, squaring or sclerosis, or new syndesmophytes over two years. One-half of the patients fell between these extremes, having one or a few new erosions, squaring or sclerosis, or up to two new syndesmophytes over two years. The factors that correlated with faster progression were male gender, preexisting radiographic damage, positive testing for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and a history of smoking.</p><p>The endpoint of spinal fusion was evaluated in a separate study of 769 United States patients, which found complete spinal fusion in 28 percent of patients with AS for more than 30 years and 43 percent of those with AS for more than 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p>Radiographic changes in the lumbar spine are associated with functional impairment in the second and third decades of disease.

AS can potentially lead to disabling spinal fusion and hyperkyphosis. (See <a href=\"#H35266036\" class=\"local\">'Nomenclature and classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal symptoms and findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13068279\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of axSpA in the United States are 1.0 to 1.4 percent. Globally, the prevalence varies depending upon the ethnic group and with the prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. The prevalence of AS is approximately 5 to 6 percent among people who are HLA-B27-positive. (See <a href=\"#H14364423\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predominant symptom of axSpA is chronic back pain, which is frequently inflammatory in character. Inflammatory low back pain is characterized by age of onset &lt;40 years, insidious onset, improvement with exercise but not with rest, and pain at night. AxSpA patients may also have peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal symptoms and findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraarticular manifestations may include anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and symptomatic as well as asymptomatic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Additional comorbidities include, for example, cardiovascular diseases. Complications may also occur. In AS, there is a significantly increased risk of vertebral fractures from low-impact trauma related to low bone mineral density (BMD). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Extraarticular manifestations and comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings are generally nonspecific and may include the presence of HLA-B27. An elevated acute phase response may be present, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), but a normal ESR and CRP do not exclude axSpA or active disease. (See <a href=\"#H23851690\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AxSpA is characterized on imaging of the sacroiliac (SI) joints in patients with AS by sacroiliitis that is evident by plain radiography and in most patients with nr-axSpA by findings of bone edema with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Plain radiographic changes may also occur in the spine, particularly in patients with AS.
