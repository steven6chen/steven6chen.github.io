The endemic mycoses (ie, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Coccidioides immitis</em>, and <em>Blastomyces dermatitidis</em>) are a diverse group of fungi that occupy a specific niche in the environment and cause infections in healthy and immunocompromised hosts, particularly those with T-cell immune deficiencies.</p><p>Histoplasmosis is an important infectious disease among patients with advanced AIDS and continues to cause severe morbidity and mortality in endemic areas, particularly in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Histoplasmosis may be the AIDS-defining illness in greater than 50 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. In resource-rich settings, disseminated disease usually occurs in patients who are not taking antiretroviral therapy at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of histoplasmosis will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients, as well as topic reviews that discuss histoplasmosis in HIV-uninfected patients are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic mycosis in AIDS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, the risk of disease in HIV-infected patients has declined with effective antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Histoplasmosis is found in temperate zones worldwide; specific endemic areas include the Mississippi, Ohio and St. Lawrence River valleys, the Caribbean, southern Mexico, certain parts of Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. In these regions, the fungus is found in high concentrations in soil contaminated with bird or bat excreta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Transmission occurs via inhalation of <em>H. capsulatum</em> spores from the soil. Thus, infection may be acquired through a multitude of activities (eg, construction, spelunking, bird handling), which can lead to inhalation of the pathogen through contaminated soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>In the early HIV epidemic, histoplasmosis occurred in 5 to 27 percent of patients with AIDS living in endemic areas of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most of these cases were caused by exogenous exposure, with progressive disseminated disease occurring shortly after initial infection. Disseminated infection has also been described in patients who were living outside of endemic areas. These cases probably represent endogenous reactivation of latent foci of infection acquired from previous travel or residence in areas of risk, although in some cases no endemic exposures were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. capsulatum</em> acts as an opportunistic pathogen, causing disseminated disease in patients with AIDS and in hosts with impaired cellular immunity. Histoplasmosis generally occurs late in the course of HIV infection, when CD4 lymphocyte counts are below 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</p><p>The importance of cellular immunity was demonstrated in one study of T-cell proliferative responses to <em>Histoplasma</em> antigens; in vitro data showed that T-cell proliferative responses were depressed in HIV-infected patients with a history of histoplasmosis and CD4 counts ranging from 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> compared with HIV-seronegative controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endemic fungi are thermally dimorphic; they exist as moulds in the environment, and as yeasts at body temperatures.

Patients with advanced AIDS usually develop progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH), a febrile, wasting illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There are few studies describing patients with HIV and histoplasmosis who have CD4 counts greater than 200 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. However, it might be expected that such individuals present similarly to the immunocompetent patient, with infection manifesting as pulmonary disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>Common symptoms include fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3-5,8,11,15,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8,11,15,20,21</a>]. Physical examination may demonstrate hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy. Skin and mucosal lesions can occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78902\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78902 \">picture 2</a>), although cutaneous lesions appear to be more common in Brazil than in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>].
