The suggested approach is useful for conceptualizing the various treatment options that are available for individual patients but may not be applicable in all settings. Attempts to generate algorithmic approaches to the treatment of HCC are difficult for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New treatments and indications for various treatments are evolving rapidly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic approaches tend to vary based upon the available expertise.</p><p/><p>Using tumor stage to select treatment is complicated by the fact that many of the staging systems (including the tumor, node, metastasis [TNM] staging system of the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">[AJCC]/Union</span> for International Cancer Control [UICC] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 2</a>)) are based upon surgical findings; surgery is applicable to only approximately 5 percent of the United States population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system has been a dominant approach to HCC, especially outside of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. BCLC classifies patients with HCC into four categories: early, intermediate, advanced, and terminal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69566\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69566 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, growing movements in the West and in Asia disagree with some principles of the algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The main areas of limitation of the BCLC, and thus points of disagreement, relate to Barcelona stage B and C patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">Milano/Mazzaferro</span> criteria for liver transplantation for HCC (ie, solitary tumor &le;5 cm or up to three tumors all &le;3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]) are not included explicitly even though they are widely accepted. According to the Barcelona algorithm, only some patients with three nodules &le;3 cm (those without &quot;associated diseases&quot;) should undergo liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although there is debate about expanding criteria for transplantation for HCC, there is no debate about the utility of Milano criteria, which have been adopted by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and other worldwide organ sharing networks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for transplantation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second issue is that the Barcelona algorithm does not address the value of resection for some subgroups of patients with HCC who may potentially benefit from this approach, including some patients defined as being &quot;early stage&quot; (with a single tumor size &gt;2 cm or multiple nodules) and &quot;intermediate stage&quot; (patients who have multi-nodular tumors but a good performance status) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69566\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69566 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one large multi-institutional study among 2046 consecutive patients undergoing resection for HCC in high-volume centers, nearly one-half (1012) were not directed by the Barcelona algorithm to have surgery, yet survival was far better than predicted by Barcelona (five-year overall survival was 61, 57, and 38 percent for patients in Barcelona stage <span class=\"nowrap\">0/A,</span> B, and C, respectively; overall 90-day mortality was &lt;3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large tumor size does not impact survival when vascular invasion is absent (eg, T1 tumors according to the TNM staging system of the <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 2</a>))&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Further, patients with T2 tumors (solitary tumor with vascular invasion or multiple tumors, none more than 5 cm) also may be suitable candidates for resection when liver function permits. Others have shown benefit from hepatic resection for patients with single HCCs over 5 cm in diameter and even selected patients with tumors &ge;10 cm.

A new evidence-based model has been developed that is based upon serum albumin and bilirubin alone (the ALBI score) that provides a simple, objective, and discriminatory method of assessing liver function in patients with HCC; it was validated in geographically distinct cohorts of patients undergoing surgery for localized disease and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> for advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The objective nature and simplicity of ALBI may diminish interobserver variation (as occurs with grading of ascites and encephalopathy in the CP scoring system) and help to refine prognostic estimates in patients treated for HCC, particularly among those with better liver function (ie, CP A cirrhosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H264051047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'ALBI score'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHPBA)/AJCC</span> Consensus Conference on HCC in 2002 concluded that no single staging system could be used to accurately stage patients across the spectrum of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In the <span class=\"nowrap\">AHPBA/AJCC</span> Second Consensus Conference on HCC of 2010, it was again concluded that no single staging system is applicable to all patients with HCC, and the Conference urged against use of a regional staging system because it precludes comparison between centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The consensus advised use of the BCLC classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69566\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69566 \">algorithm 2</a>) in medical patients with advanced liver disease who are not candidates for liver transplantation or resection (with advice of caution among Barcelona stage B and C patients, some of whom might be considered for resection or transplantation) and concluded that the <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC</span> classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 2</a>) is valid for HCC staging among patients undergoing liver resection.

The ideal patient for resection has a solitary HCC confined to the liver that shows no radiographic evidence of invasion of the hepatic vasculature, no evidence of portal hypertension, and well-preserved hepatic function. Long-term relapse-free survival rates average 40 percent or better, and five-year survival rates as high as 90 percent are reported in carefully selected patients.</p><p>The preoperative evaluation should focus on the likelihood of disease being confined to the liver, and whether the anatomic constraints of the intrahepatic tumor and underlying liver function will permit resection. Although many surgeons restrict eligibility for resection to patients with tumors that are &le;5 cm in diameter, there is no general rule regarding tumor size for selection of patients for resection. Patients with a solitary HCC without vascular invasion have a similar survival probability regardless of tumor size, although patients with smaller tumors tend to have a better outcome.</p><p>According to the current American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system for HCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 2</a>), most consider stage IIIB, IVA, or IVB disease to be incurable by resection. These stages are defined by invasion of a major portal or hepatic vein, direct invasion of organs other than the gallbladder, perforation of the visceral peritoneum, and nodal as well as distant metastases. However, hepatic resection for stages IIIB, IIIC, and IVA disease may be considered for very rare and selected cases, and only in a center of excellence. Clinical benefits and long-term survival can be achieved in only a very small minority of patients.</p><p>Although the rare situation of tumor rupture of an HCC suggests a high likelihood of peritoneal seeding and a poor outcome from resection, this is not inevitable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97793\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97793 \">image 1</a>). Several retrospective series suggest a low but defined long-term survival rate following resection in such situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common approach is initial control of bleeding (which may require embolization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97795\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97795 \">image 2</a>) or emergency surgery) followed by a formal staging evaluation, and a subsequent attempt at resection, if feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Prognosis, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, and posttreatment surveillance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of hepatic reserve is paramount to selection for resection. Perioperative mortality is twice as high in cirrhotic as in noncirrhotic patients unless proper patient selection is applied. For patients with cirrhosis, surgical resection is most safely performed in those with Child-Pugh class A disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) who have a normal bilirubin and well preserved liver function. Patients with Child-Pugh class A liver function who require major resection should undergo liver volumetry, and portal vein embolization should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Assessment of hepatic reserve'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Prognosis, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, and posttreatment surveillance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-portal-vein-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative portal vein embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Resection as an option for patients with HCC and Child-Pugh B cirrhosis remains controversial.</p><p>The influence of hepatic function on outcomes in patients with HCC can be illustrated by the CLIP (Cancer of the Liver Italian Program) staging classification, which incorporates tumor stage as well as hepatic function to predict survival in HCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69726 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Preoperative assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance#H969400084\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Prognosis, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, and posttreatment surveillance&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all patients who are considered for liver transplantation are unresectable because of the degree of underlying liver dysfunction rather than tumor extent; in fact, liver transplantation can be described as appropriate for patients with earlier stage HCC and advanced liver disease. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a suitable option for patients with liver disease (usually cirrhosis) who would not tolerate liver resection and who have a solitary HCC &le;5 cm in diameter or up to three separate lesions none of which is larger than 3 cm, no evidence of gross vascular invasion, and no regional nodal or distant metastases.</p><p>When these selection criteria are strictly applied, excellent overall three- to four-year actuarial (75 to 85 percent) and recurrence-free survival rates (83 to 92 percent) can be achieved, although these series represent highly selected cases. In carefully selected patients undergoing OLT for HCC, long-term survival is similar or only slightly worse than survival for patients undergoing OLT for non-malignant causes. A scoring system (the Risk Estimation of Tumor Recurrence After Transplant [RETREAT] score) to determine individual recurrence risk for patients who meet Milan criteria and are transplanted for HCC is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H2553020163\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'RETREAT and MoRAL scores'</a>.)</p><p>Other more extended criteria are being considered to widen the indications for OLT, but these extended criteria have not yet been universally adopted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Expanded transplant criteria'</a>.)</p><p>A major disadvantage with OLT (in addition to the need for lifelong immunosuppression with its attendant risks) is the long waiting time for donor organs. Shortage of donor livers has necessitated the development of allocation schema, whereby priority for donor organs is given to the most severely ill patients. In the United States, liver allocation for adults is based upon the &quot;model for end stage liver disease&quot; or MELD score, a statistical model predicting survival in patients with cirrhosis. A diagnosis of HCC increases the priority score for donor organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld#H16431884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;, section on 'Hepatocellular carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Nevertheless, even with higher priority MELD scores, waiting times for a donor organ may be many months. Bridging therapy with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or partial hepatectomy is a reasonable approach while a patient is on the waiting list for an OLT in order to maintain their eligibility. Living donor transplantation is being applied, although this approach is also controversial. Waiting time is obviously much shorter, and results seem to be at least as good as with deceased donor livers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Bridging therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Living donor transplantation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiofrequency ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RFA involves the local application of radiofrequency thermal energy to the lesion, in which a high frequency alternating current moves from the tip of an electrode into the tissue surrounding that electrode. As the ions within the tissue attempt to follow the change in the direction of the alternating current, their movement results in frictional heating of the tissue. As the temperature within the tissue becomes elevated beyond 60&ordm;C, cells begin to die, resulting in a region of necrosis surrounding the electrode.</p><p>RFA is a reasonable option for patients who do not meet resectability criteria for HCC and yet are candidates for a liver-directed procedure based upon the presence of liver-only disease. Although there is no absolute tumor size beyond which RFA should not be considered, the best outcomes are in patients with a single tumor &lt;4 cm in diameter. For cirrhotic patients, some clinicians restrict RFA to those with Child-Pugh class A or B severity only (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>). As noted above, RFA has also been used as a &quot;bridging&quot; therapy in patients awaiting liver transplantation to reduce the rate of dropout because of tumor progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-radiofrequency-ablation-percutaneous-ethanol-injection-thermal-ablation-and-cryoablation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical therapies for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, thermal ablation, and cryoablation&quot;, section on 'Radiofrequency ablation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Bridging therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of RFA relative to surgical resection for patients with potentially resectable HCC remains controversial. Few retrospective series report long-term outcomes from RFA, and there are no randomized trials that directly compare the two treatments.

Before the advent of RFA, PEI was the most widely accepted, minimally invasive method for treating such patients. Although it is low cost, requires a minimal amount of equipment, and has good clinical results, the greater efficacy of RFA has supplanted its use in many institutions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-radiofrequency-ablation-percutaneous-ethanol-injection-thermal-ablation-and-cryoablation#H950876927\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical therapies for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, thermal ablation, and cryoablation&quot;, section on 'RFA versus PEI'</a>.)</p><p>Similar results have been achieved with the percutaneous injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a>, which may have fewer side effects than ethanol.

TACE involves the injection of a chemotherapeutic agent, with or without lipiodol or a procoagulant material, into the hepatic artery. Lipiodol is an oily contrast agent that promotes intratumoral retention of chemotherapy drugs. A more recent method of chemoembolization involves the use of drug-eluting polyvinyl alcohol microspheres (&quot;beads&quot;), which seem to cause less toxicity with similar efficacy. Simultaneous or sequential occlusion of the hepatic artery until stagnation of blood flow to the tumor occurs may result in greater anti-tumor efficacy than chemotherapy alone.</p><p>TACE is used most often for the treatment of large unresectable HCCs that are not amenable to other treatments such as resection or RFA; its use as a &quot;bridging therapy&quot; prior to transplant is common. Bland particle embolization alone (ie, without chemotherapy) has also been used for both unresectable and locally recurrent HCC. Among worldwide guidelines, The Korean Liver Cancer Study <span class=\"nowrap\">Group/National</span> Cancer Center Korea <span class=\"nowrap\">(KLCSG/NCC)</span> guidelines acknowledge broad indications for TACE, probably based on the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in that regional population; these include treatment for patients with good performance status and an HCC without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread who are ineligible for curative treatments, including surgical resection, liver transplantation, RFA, or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Although HCC is a radiosensitive tumor, it is located in an extremely radiosensitive organ. As a whole, the liver can only tolerate approximately 20 Gy, although newer techniques using three dimensional conformal treatment planning or stereotactic focusing may permit the guided delivery of up to 100 Gy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The utility of external beam RT in patients with portal vein thrombus is of growing interest. This subject is discussed elsewhere.

The beams converge precisely on the target lesion, minimizing radiation exposure to adjacent normal tissue. This targeting allows treatment of extracranial sites in either a single or limited number of dose fractions.</p><p>Stereotactic approaches to RT are increasingly being used for treatment of metastatic liver tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Experience with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary liver tumors is limited but increasing; SBRT may be complementary to other existing ablative options in patients with tumors that are otherwise not amenable to other treatment modalities, such as those with tumor vascular thrombus.

Most interesting in this category is (90Y) radioembolization. Similar to traditional transarterial chemoembolization, radioembolization utilizes particles embedded with Yttrium-90. Selection for radioembolization continues to require evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. Benefits over other forms of local therapy include relatively low toxicity, potential to treat patients with significant tumor burden (often in a single setting rather than multiple sessions as for classic TACE), and relatively limited side effects. However, high cost, certain anatomical constraints (eg, pass-through of the radioactive material to the lung in some patients with shunting), and a question of less effective tumor necrosis than seen with TACE limit the utility of this treatment. A specific role for radioembolization in the context of other local treatment modalities has not been defined. It is under active study for patients with portal vein thrombosis and those with advanced disease but preserved liver function. Ultimately, randomized controlled trials will be needed to compare the efficacy of this approach with other nonsurgical therapies, but this approach is rapidly gaining ground because of low morbidity and reasonable tumor control.
