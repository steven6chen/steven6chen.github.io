Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now preferred for most patients if it can be performed by an experienced operator with less than a two-hour delay from presentation to the emergency department. Due in part to limited availability of primary PCI, fibrinolytic therapy remains an important therapeutic modality.

Coronary arteriography, performed in the acute period following NSTEMI, demonstrates that the infarct-related artery is not occluded in 60 to 85 percent of cases. Since microvascular perfusion is often reduced in patients with NSTEMI, the ongoing mechanism of ischemia is more likely to be embolization than epicardial vessel occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Currently used fibrinolytic drugs are intravenously infused plasminogen activators that activate the blood fibrinolytic system. These agents have a high specificity for their substrate plasminogen, hydrolyzing a peptide bond to yield the active enzyme plasmin. Free plasmin is rapidly neutralized by the serine proteinase inhibitor alpha-antiplasmin, whereas fibrin-bound plasmin is protected from rapid inhibition, thereby promoting clot lysis. </p><p>The characteristics of the different fibrinolytic agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56744 \">table 1</a>) and their efficacy in clinical trials of patients with STEMI will be reviewed here.

At 21 days, overall in-hospital mortality was significantly lower among patients receiving streptokinase (10.7 versus 13 percent in the control group). The degree of benefit was related to time between onset of symptoms and streptokinase treatment; mortality was 8.2 versus 15.4 percent for patients treated within one hour, 9.2 versus 12 percent in those treated within three hours, and 11.7 versus 14.1 percent for treatment between three and six hours; there was no difference when patients were treated beyond six hours.

This study was the first to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of aspirin in reducing mortality in acute MI. Patients presenting within six hours had an overall mortality of 13.2 percent at five weeks. With aspirin, the mortality rate was lowered to 10.2 percent (a 23 percent reduction).

In contrast to streptokinase, it is fibrin-specific and fibrin-bound tPA has increased affinity for plasminogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>]. tPA is a poor enzyme in the absence of fibrin, but fibrin strikingly enhances the activation rate of plasminogen. Combination with fibrin allows tPA to attach to thrombus with resultant lysis; in comparison, non-fibrin-bound tPA in the systemic circulation does not extensively activate plasminogen.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alteplase</a> has a short half-life (three to four minutes). In contrast to streptokinase, alteplase results in less fibrinogen depletion and is not associated with allergic or hypotensive effects in contrast to streptokinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Intravenous heparin (for at least 24 hours) is generally required as concomitant therapy to maintain vessel patency and to prevent reocclusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56744 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the theoretical advantages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>, two initial trials, GISSI-2 and ISIS-3, found no difference in efficacy between alteplase and streptokinase given with or without subcutaneous heparin&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The failure of these trials to show a survival benefit for alteplase over streptokinase raised questions about the use of subcutaneous heparin in these studies. Because alteplase and streptokinase affect the thrombolytic cascade differently, many believed that intravenous heparin was necessary to compare the efficacy of the two agents. This argument influenced the design of further studies, including GUSTO-I.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">GUSTO-I trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although several different dosing regimens have been designed for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>, an accelerated or &quot;front-loaded&quot; regimen is currently most popular and appears to be superior to streptokinase as shown in the GUSTO-I trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Combination therapy with alteplase and streptokinase showed a trend toward a worse outcome than with alteplase alone.</p><p>The mortality benefit for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> was greatest in patients less than 75 years old and in those with anterior wall infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>]. However, virtually all subgroups, including patients who were older, had a nonanterior infarction or hypertension, or had a prior MI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, showed a benefit from accelerated alteplase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20,21</a>].</p><p>In the angiographic substudy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of TIMI grade III flow (ie, normal blood flow in the infarct-related artery) at 90 minutes (54 versus 30 to 33 percent in the streptokinase groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This difference is thought to account for much of the improved outcome with alteplase, since the short- and long-term clinical benefits of thrombolytic therapy correlate only with the restoration of TIMI grade III flow, which enhances myocardial salvage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75629 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70952 \">figure 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22,23</a>].

Early thrombolysis was associated with a lower mortality rate; thrombolytic agents given less than two hours after the onset of infarction yielded a 30-day mortality of 5.5 percent, versus 9.0 percent if administration was delayed until greater than four hours.
