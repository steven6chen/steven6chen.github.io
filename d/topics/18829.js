In a phase II study of 73 adults with moderate or severe OSA comparing the cannabinoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a> with placebo, dronabinol reduced the severity of OSA as measured by the apnea hypoxia index (AHI), although wakefulness, sleep architecture, and overnight oxygenation were unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Dronabinol was well tolerated with no reported difference in the rate of adverse events. Phase III trials should highlight whether this drug is clinically effective as a therapy for OSA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115471\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of cognitive impairment in adults with sleep-disordered breathing (November 2017)</span></p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other causes of sleep-disordered breathing are increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia, possibly through deleterious effects of hypoxemia or shared vascular risk factors. In a pooled analysis of prospective studies in over 200,000 adults, those with sleep-disordered breathing were 26 percent more likely to develop clinically relevant cognitive decline or dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Further studies are needed to determine whether effective treatment of OSA can reduce the risk of dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia#H2730871576\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia&quot;, section on 'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115182\"><span class=\"h2\">Unilateral phrenic nerve stimulation device for central sleep apnea (October 2017)</span></p><p>An implantable device that causes diaphragmatic contraction via unilateral transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of moderate to severe central sleep apnea (CSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a randomized trial in which 151 patients with moderate to severe CSA underwent device implantation, those assigned to active stimulation for six months were more likely to achieve 50 percent or greater reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index than those assigned to no stimulation (51 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Therapy-related discomfort was reported by over one-third of patients but resolved with device reprogramming in all but one. The one-year device complication rate was approximately 10 percent in both groups. Additional studies on cardiovascular outcomes and long-term safety are needed to determine the role of the device in relation to other less invasive therapies for CSA.

In a study that assessed 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in 160 consecutive adults with narcolepsy type 1, rates of hypertension were 41 percent in untreated patients and 58 percent in patients taking stimulant medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Older males with comorbid obesity were at highest risk. Cardiovascular risk factor assessment and modification is an important part of health maintenance in all patients with narcolepsy.

In a randomized trial of 23 adults with sleep-related bruxism, over half of patients who received onabotulinum toxin-A injections reported symptomatic improvement, compared with none of the patients assigned to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Two patients in the active arm had a cosmetic change in smile; no patients experienced dysphagia or masseter muscle weakness. These results add support to the role of botulinum toxin A injections in selected patients with severe sleep-related or awake bruxism who do not respond to oral devices and pharmacotherapy.

The review summarizes clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of opioids in refractory RLS and promotes safe prescribing practices that include screening for opioid use disorder, consulting state prescription drug monitoring programs, and use of urine drug screens and opioid contracts. Based on expert consensus, the panel suggests a range of specific agents and effective doses of opioids for refractory RLS, which are considerably lower than those used for chronic pain.

However, HSATs are not recommended for diagnosis of OSA in children, as explained in a position paper from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The main concerns are that HSATs may underestimate OSA presence and severity in children and technical challenges of obtaining adequate data in this population.

In a series of 40 children with narcolepsy type 1 who underwent video polysomnography, nearly one-third of patients exhibited motor behaviors during REM sleep ranging from classic dream enactment (eg, vigorous reaching or throwing movements) to more calm, slow pantomime-like events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Events were more common among children with impaired nighttime sleep, worse daytime sleepiness, and severe cataplexy.

In the largest prospective study to date of over 160,000 healthy, nonobese adults, self-reported sleep duration &lt;6 hours per day was associated with the development of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors over an 18-year follow-up period, including central obesity, elevated fasting glucose, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Increases in relative risk ranged from 6 to 12 percent for each individual factor. Healthy sleep behavior is recommended by the American Heart Association and others to promote optimal cardiac health.

In a meta-analysis of 17 observational studies, self-reported sleepiness while driving was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the relative risk of motor vehicle crash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sleep-medicine/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Groups at especially high risk of habitual drowsy driving include teenagers, patients with obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders, commercial drivers, and night shift workers.
