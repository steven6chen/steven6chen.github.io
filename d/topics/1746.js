This cyst can cause symptoms, such as pain or knee stiffness. The medical term for a Baker's cyst is &quot;popliteal cyst.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500668\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a Baker's cyst?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baker's cysts do not always cause symptoms. When they do, the symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the back of the knee</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or a bulge at the back of the knee, especially when the leg is straight</p><p/><p>People often find that their symptoms get worse if they stand for a long time or bend their knee too far. Symptoms and swelling sometimes also get worse with activity.</p><p>In some cases, Baker's cysts tear open and leak their fluid onto nearby tissues. If that happens, symptoms can include calf swelling and redness, or bruising below the knee.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500683\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have the symptoms described above, see your doctor or nurse. Not all swelling behind the knee is due to a Baker's cyst. Your doctor or nurse can look at your knee and talk to you about your symptoms to decide what to do next.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500698\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. If you have a Baker's cyst, your doctor or nurse will probably be able to tell just by doing an exam. But if he or she is not sure, you might need an imaging test, such as an X-ray or an ultrasound. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500713\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a Baker's cyst treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment is an injection of steroid medicines directly into the knee. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids reduce swelling and inflammation.</p><p>If treatment with steroid medicines does not work, other (much less used) options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Draining the cyst with a needle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the cyst</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500728\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse might suggest resting the knee and taking medicines called &quot;NSAIDs&quot; for 1 to 2 weeks before he or she orders an imaging test or suggests a knee injection. Some examples of NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample band names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample band names: Aleve).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500743\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Knee pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Knee pain (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
