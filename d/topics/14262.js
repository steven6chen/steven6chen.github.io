As of October 2008, guidelines from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States state that hospitals will no longer receive additional payments when patients develop stage 3 or 4 pressure induced injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76128204\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'NPUAP staging'</a>.)</p><p>These changes were made to recognize the fact that lesser degrees of skin damage due to pressure may not be associated with skin ulceration (Stage 1) and that deep tissue injury can occur without overlying skin ulceration (suspected deep tissue injury) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903 \">table 1</a>). However, their generalized term &quot;pressure injury&quot; does not address the many other types of injury that can result from pressure, such as rhabdomyolysis in an unconscious patient. Thus, we will use the term &quot;pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot; to encompass the broad range of ischemic damage that can be caused by prolonged pressure. The terms &quot;pressure-induced skin injury&quot; or &quot;pressure-induced soft tissue (or deep tissue) injury&quot; are used where specifically applicable. We use the term &quot;pressure injury&quot; when referring to the staging of a specific lesion as defined by the NPUAP classification (eg, unstageable pressure injury) or to replace the term &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; in studies published prior to this classification change that use &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; generically when the stage is not specified. We use the term &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; for the specific circumstance where the integrity of the skin surface is disrupted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk assessment, which includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, should identify patients at risk for pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries who will benefit from preventive measures as well as factors that are potentially correctable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Inexpensive static devices or overlays are acceptable in most situations, whereas dynamic support surfaces may be more appropriate in patients who are at high risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76126129\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76127216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Risk prediction'</a>.)</p><p>There is reasonably good evidence to suggest that mattress overlays on operating tables and hospital beds reduce the incidence of pressure injuries compared with no overlay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. In an updated Cochrane review, a total of 59 trials were included. Pressure-relieving overlays on the operating table reduced the incidence of postoperative pressure injuries. In a meta-analysis of two trials, the use of a micropulse overlay system in the operating room significantly reduced the incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.70) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Two trials indicated that foam overlays caused adverse skin changes. A meta-analysis of three trials suggest that Australian Medical Sheepskin, when placed over a mattress, may also be beneficial in relieving pressure (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>It is less clear how different classes of support surfaces, or different products within a class of support surfaces, compare. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated superiority of one product class over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p>A network meta-analysis that included 65 studies concluded that there is moderate certainty that powered active air surfaces are better for preventing pressure ulcers compared with a standard hospital mattress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Trials comparing static surfaces and overlays with dynamic surfaces have been inconsistent, with some but not all trials demonstrating better outcomes for the more expensive dynamic devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>]. One particularly well-designed trial involving 1972 patients (PRESSURE trial) compared two dynamic devices, alternating pressure mattresses and alternating pressure overlays, and found no differences in the number of new pressure injuries (grade 2 or worse) or the median time for their development; patient satisfaction was higher for the mattress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The PRESSURE 2 clinical trial, which plans to randomize over 2500 acutely ill patients to high specification foam mattress or an alternating pressure mattress, is currently under way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Dynamic support devices in high-risk patients may be cost effective. In a trial that randomly assigned 100 intensive care unit patients to an air-suspension bed or standard bed, the risk of developing pressure injuries was lower in those using the air-suspension bed (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.41) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The cost of dynamic support surfaces may be offset by reduced length of hospitalization, wound care that includes nursing time and wound care supplies, and possibly surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One study of air suspension beds in an intensive care unit found that this intervention resulted in cost savings of over $700 per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For routine use, standard mattresses without an overlay should probably not be used, but alternative foam mattresses may provide a singular solution. In the Cochrane review, a meta-analysis of five trials found a significantly reduced incidence of pressure injuries in patients using alternative foam compared with standard foam mattresses (risk ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Unfortunately, there are no trials comparing standard mattresses plus overlay with alternative foam mattresses. </p><p>For chair-bound patients, full-seat wheelchair cushions are recommended. Donut cushions should <strong>not</strong> be used because they increase edema and venous congestion and concentrate the pressure to surrounding tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Selection of customized chair cushions requires the services of a qualified seating specialist. The three main types of seat cushions include gel and foam seat cushions, nonpowered adjustable cushions, and powered adjustable seat cushions. Adjustable seat cushions contain a honeycomb of air cells that are first fully inflated, placed under the patient and then partially deflated via a release valve to better conform to the patient's body; the patient essentially floats on a cushion of air while sitting in the chair. Powered seat cushions include a motorized blower to circulate the air within the cushion. In a study of 232 wheelchair-bound nursing home residents, significantly fewer pressure injuries developed in those randomly assigned to use a skin protection cushion (air, viscous fluid and foam, or gel and foam cushion) compared with a standard segmented foam cushion (10.6 versus 17.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784109896\"><span class=\"h2\">Static positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper positioning, including repositioning with particular attention to vulnerable tissue overlying bony prominences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80206 \">figure 1</a>), is an integral component of prevention that is recommended for all bed-bound individuals. Proper positioning and repositioning have a sound theoretical rationale, but available data are of low quality. In the absence of good-quality evidence, we position and reposition the patients as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784109942\"><span class=\"h3\">Position and inclination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The position and head inclination of bed-bound patients is likely to be important. It is recommended that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pillows or foam wedges should be placed between the ankles and knees to avoid pressure at these sites when patients have no mobility at these areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heels require particular attention; pillows may be placed under the lower legs to elevate the heels, or special heel protectors can be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be placed at an angle &le;30 degrees when lying on their side to avoid direct pressure over the greater trochanter or other bony prominences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The head of the bed should not be elevated more than 30 degrees to prevent sliding and friction injury.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784109948\"><span class=\"h3\">Repositioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Turning should be performed successively from the back, to one side, and then to the other side. The aim of repositioning is to reduce interface pressure and maintain microcirculation to areas at risk for pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is important that repositioning be done gently and properly, with the assistance of devices as necessary to avoid friction and shear forces. Timing and positioning should be documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Prevention of progression of a stage 1 pressure injury may require more frequent repositioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Chair-bound patients may generate considerable pressures over the ischial tuberosities; they should be repositioned at least every hour with wheelchair pushups or with tilting of the seat to reduce contact between the patient's buttocks and the seat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients who are cognitively intact and are able to use their upper extremities can be trained to shift weight even more frequently, using monitoring devices as a reminder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784110010\"><span class=\"h3\">Repositioning interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, a two-hour interval is recommended for repositioning. It has been demonstrated that skin erythema and ischemic changes can occur in healthy adults in less than two hours on a standard mattress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Skin and soft tissues with borderline perfusion at baseline can develop irreversible changes with even shorter intervals of pressure. Whether a two-hour frequency (versus a longer interval) is optimal is uncertain, particularly when a high-quality support surface is being used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A Cochrane systematic review included only three trials evaluating the effects of any repositioning schedule or different patient positions with respect to the incidence of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury in the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. All three trials were at high risk of bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Two trials compared the 30&deg; and 90&deg; tilt positions using similar repositioning frequencies. A pooled analysis found no risk difference for a 30&deg; tilt compared with the standard 90&deg; position. The third trial compared differing repositioning frequencies. The incidence of new lesions was no different for repositioning every two versus every three hours on a standard mattress or between every four and every six hours on viscoelastic foam. However, each of these studies was underpowered to detect meaningful differences. Whether any of these interventions are cost effective remains unclear. A later study of 942 at-risk nursing home residents managed on a high-density foam mattress found no differences in incidence for those turned at two-, three-, or four-hour intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784110114\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous lateral rotation was originally developed to enhance respiratory function in hospitalized patients but has been advocated by some for the prevention and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries. Continuous lateral rotation is achieved with a mechanized bed that continuously rotates around its longitudinal axis. Observational studies indicate modest improvements in healing rates when continuous lateral rotation is added to an advanced therapy surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Conceptually, the advantage gained by this automated approach to pressure reduction could be offset by the presence of continuous shearing forces. Technical parameters, such as bed rotation frequency and bed tilt angle, need to be better defined. Continuous rotation therapy is not likely to replace the need to reposition the patient every two hours, and there is insufficient evidence to support its use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to positioning and pressure support devices, other preventive measures may be helpful and are indicated on the basis of individual patient assessment. There is minimal evidence from randomized trials to support many of these interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Improve mobility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Encouraging patient mobility is key to the prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries.

The tabs can be left open at the sides of the incontinence briefs to allow air circulation. An alternative method is to place absorptive pads under the patient without a diaper so that any incontinence episode can be readily detected and addressed. An indwelling or condom catheter is sometimes needed when treating an ulcer. Practices for managing urinary incontinence have been described in a Clinical Practice Guideline from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2460214121\"><span class=\"h3\">Multilayer foam dressings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While dressings have traditionally been used as a treatment for existing ulcers, studies have examined the role of multilayer foam dressings in preventing pressure ulcers. These dressings, when used as a component of pressure ulcer prevention strategies, are placed over a bony prominence and help mitigate loading forces applied to the skin. In one large clinical trial from Australia, the use of preemptive dressings in trauma and critically ill patients significantly reduced the incidence of pressure injuries compared with no such dressings (3.1 versus 13.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The dressings were initiated in the emergency department and maintained throughout the hospital stay. An observational study in United States hospitals between 2010 and 2015 showed that the adoption of a multilayer foam dressing was associated with significant reduced rates of pressure injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Correct malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional goals should address any documented nutritional compromise. Formal nutritional assessment should be carried out and a plan of support instituted to address any deficiencies. If dietary intake of protein or calories is inadequate, the factors compromising intake should be addressed as part of total patient care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is generally felt that adequate nutrition may both help prevent ulcer formation and promote healing of early-stage ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/9,22,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22,39</a>]. Unless there is a contraindication, individuals at risk of developing pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury should have a protein intake of approximately 1.2 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/kg</span> body weight daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Studies evaluating nutritional supplements or enteral feedings for prevention have inconclusive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/11,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40</a>]. The effectiveness of specific nutritional interventions, such as tube feedings or dietary supplements, will depend on the baseline nutritional status of participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/9,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,41</a>]. One study in critically ill older adult patients did find that patients who were only given a standard diet, compared with oral nutritional supplementation plus standard diet, were at increased risk, although questions have been raised about methodological aspects of this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Due to the many methodological problems in studies of nutritional interventions, systematic reviews have concluded that there is no clear evidence of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/11,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40</a>], but appropriate medical care would suggest that all nutritional deficiencies should be addressed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1562923\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY INITIATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key components of successful prevention initiatives are given in national guidelines (eg, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] toolkit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]); some of these are listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staff education on best prevention practices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardized forms for documenting ulcer appearance and interventions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more members of the nursing team designated as a skin care champion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instituting prompts for turning patients at regular intervals.

The AHRQ On-Time Pressure Ulcer Prevention Program, a clinical decision support intervention addressing a variety of risk factors including nutritional status, weight, and moisture, has been shown to lower the incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1563281\"><span class=\"h1\">PROVIDER EDUCATION AND STAFFING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single individual involved in patient care is able to prevent pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries. Rather, prevention requires a coordinated effort of multiple disciplines. Failures are less common when effective systems for staff education are in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. When an ulcer does occur, problems contributing to its development should be identified and methods for solving these problems implemented. </p><p>Sufficient staffing levels are necessary for effective prevention, and it is easy to understand why some failures will inevitably occur given that a single bed-bound patient must be repositioned over 4000 times per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Adequate staffing and the availability of resources in nursing facilities may depend upon the business model (for-profit versus not-for-profit) of the facility. </p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials and observational studies found a significantly lower risk for not-for-profit facilities compared with for-profit facilities (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The results were consistent with two other analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. For-profit facilities have strong incentives to minimize expenditures, and, although the average effect supported not-for-profit facilities, the authors noted variability in the quality of nursing home care due to a variety of factors, including managerial styles, business motivations, and organizational behavior. In an observational study of 12,473 certified nursing facilities in the United States evaluating over two million residents, the quality of nursing care was the primary factor contributing to an increased prevalence at facilities with a high concentration of minority patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1563503\"><span class=\"h1\">FAILURE OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although implementation of preventive practices can decrease the rate of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries, some patients may be at such a high risk (eg, heart failure, terminal illness, impending death) that development cannot be avoided even if best practices have been implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186016118\"><span class=\"h1\">COST EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cost effectiveness of preventive strategies has received a limited amount of attention. Based upon cost modeling, several studies have found the use of pressure redistribution surfaces to be cost effective or even cost saving. </p><p>One study simulated admissions to an acute care hospital and compared enhanced prevention practices versus standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Preventive measures resulted in greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and saved money. This conclusion mirrors results from a randomized clinical trial of specialized beds in an intensive care unit that found fewer pressure injuries and lower costs associated with preventive intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The cost effectiveness of using support surfaces on emergency department (ED) stretchers and beds as an early measure for prevention in older adult patients admitted through the ED was also studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The model projected an incidence of emergency department-acquired pressure injuries of 1.9 percent with current practice and 1.5 percent with early preventive strategies, which corresponded to a number-needed-to-treat of 238 patients. Early prevention was more effective and less costly than standard practice even for short emergency department stays (ie, one hour), with a mean cost-saving of $32 per patient. </p><p>Another study modelled the cost effectiveness of viscoelastic overlays in patients requiring surgical procedures lasting longer than 90 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An intraoperative prevention strategy that decreased the incidence by 0.51 percent corresponded to a number-needed-to-treat of 196 patients. The average cost of using the operating table overlay was calculated to be $1.66 per patient. For the projected decrease in the incidence, the cost savings averaged $46 per patient. </p><p>An evaluation of preventive strategies used in long-term nursing home care also found that support surfaces are cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Multiple strategies were evaluated, including pressure redistribution surfaces, oral nutritional supplements for high-risk residents with recent weight loss, skin emollients for high-risk residents with dry skin, and skin cleansing for high-risk residents requiring incontinence care. Preventive strategies cost, on average, $11.66 per resident per week. The lifetime risk of developing a pressure injury was reduced with the use of preventive strategies, and the number-needed-to-treat was calculated to be 45 for pressure redistribution surfaces, 63 for skin cleansing, 158 for skin emollients, and 333 for nutritional supplementation. Pressure redistribution surfaces and skin cleansing reduced the mean lifetime cost by $115 and $179 per resident, respectively. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was less than $50,000 for support surfaces and skin cleansing but exceeded $50,000 for nutritional supplements and skin emollients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
