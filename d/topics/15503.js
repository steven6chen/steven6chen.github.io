The conduction disturbance can be transient or permanent, with conduction that is delayed, intermittent, or absent. Commonly used terminology includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First degree AV block &ndash; Delayed conduction from the atrium to the ventricle (defined as a prolonged PR interval of &gt;200 milliseconds) without interruption in atrial to ventricular conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second degree AV block &ndash; Intermittent atrial conduction to the ventricle, often in a regular pattern (eg, 2:1, 3:2), or higher degrees of block, which are further classified into Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) and Mobitz type II second degree AV block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third degree (complete) AV block &ndash; No atrial impulses conduct to the ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade AV block &ndash; Two or more consecutive blocked P waves.</p><p/><p>The clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of Mobitz type II second degree AV block will be reviewed here.

In this situation, every other P wave is non-conducted and there is no opportunity to observe for the constant PR interval that is characteristic of Mobitz type II second degree AV block.

Common potentially reversible causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic &ndash; Myocardial ischemia (acute or chronic) involving the conduction system, cardiomyopathy (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis), myocarditis (eg, Lyme disease), endocarditis with abscess formation, hyperkalemia, and hypervagotonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic &ndash; Medication-related (AV nodal blocking medications), post-cardiac surgery, post-catheter ablation, post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation.</p><p/><p>Mobitz type II second degree AV block is rarely seen in patients without underlying heart disease. When identifiable, the reversible causes most commonly associated with Mobitz type II second degree AV block are myocardial infarction with ischemia of the AV node and medications that alter conduction through the AV node (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers). When no specific reversible cause is identified, the block is often felt to be related to idiopathic progressive cardiac conduction disease with myocardial fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sclerosis that affects the conduction system.

Patients with bundle branch involvement also have axis shifts and QRS widening depending upon the location of the block. In addition, at least two-thirds of patients with this disorder also have bifascicular or even trifascicular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-ii/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

The evaluation of all patients with suspected Mobitz type II second degree AV block includes a thorough history, including medications and recent changes in medications, along with a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and bloodwork (which includes serum electrolytes and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125048600\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected Mobitz type II second degree AV block should be questioned about any history of heart disease, both congenital and acquired, as well as any recent cardiac procedures or medications that could predispose to AV conduction abnormalities. Patients without known cardiac disease should be questioned about other systemic diseases associated with heart block (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis). Patients who live in an area with endemic Lyme disease should be questioned about any recent outdoor exposure to ticks or known tick bites. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with suspected Mobitz type II second degree AV block that occurs in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction should undergo concurrent diagnosis and treatment for both conditions.

However, if the patient has sinus bradycardia at baseline, or there are more frequent non-conducted beats, there may be a significant reduction in cardiac output resulting in symptoms of hypoperfusion or heart failure.</p><p>The failure of one or more P waves to conduct to the ventricles can lead to fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, or syncope (called Stokes-Adams attacks) since the lower intrinsic cardiac pacemakers are slower than junctional pacemakers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64261\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64261 \">waveform 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-ii/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. </p><p>Patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block often present with bradycardia but may have a normal sinus rhythm rate. Additionally, other than the presence of an irregular pulse, there are few specific physical examination findings. Patients may appear pale or diaphoretic if they have bradycardia with a resultant reduction in cardiac output. Patients with underlying heart failure that is exacerbated by the development of heart block may have crackles on lung examination, elevated jugular venous pulsations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125048864\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobitz type II second degree AV block is identified by consistent unchanging PR intervals (which are usually normal in duration but may be prolonged) followed by the block of one or more P waves that fail to conduct to the ventricles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79539\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79539 \">waveform 5</a>).</p><p>Mobitz type II second degree AV block is distinguished from other types of AV block as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with first degree AV block have a PR interval that is prolonged (&gt;200 milliseconds) but constant, and each P wave is followed by a QRS interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67882\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67882 \">waveform 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Mobitz type I second degree AV block have progressive prolongation of the PR interval for several heart beats, followed by a non-conducted P wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73051\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73051 \">waveform 1</a>). For patients with second degree AV block with a ratio of atrial to ventricular conduction that is not 2:1, Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II second degree AV block are easily distinguished. However, for patients with 2:1 atrial to ventricular conduction, the distinction between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II second degree AV block cannot be made from the surface ECG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block#H20201863\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type I (Wenckebach block)&quot;, section on 'ECG findings and diagnostic maneuvers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with third degree (complete) AV block will have evidence of atrial (P waves) and ventricular (QRS complexes) activity that are independent of each other on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72863\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72863 \">waveform 3</a>). In rare instances, the atrial rate may be exactly twice the ventricular rate, resulting in 2:1 AV block which can mimic second degree AV block.</p><p/><p>An increase in heart rate due to exercise, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, or atrial pacing can worsen Mobitz type II second degree AV block. Conversely, vagal maneuvers may slow the sinus rate, allow more time for excitability to recover in or below the bundle of His, thereby facilitating conduction across the AV node and improving Mobitz type II second degree AV block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block#H20201863\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type I (Wenckebach block)&quot;, section on 'ECG findings and diagnostic maneuvers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2169405\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiology study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrophysiology studies (EPS) may identify patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block who are at increased risk of progression to third degree (complete) heart block. However, since nearly all patients without a readily identifiable reversible cause are candidates for a permanent pacemaker, EPS is of limited value and not usually performed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies&quot;</a>). There is a 2017 case report that describes the successful treatment of second degree AV block with catheter ablation of a ventricular nodal pathway manifesting as concealed and manifest junctional beats. In this very rare circumstance where concealed junctional extrasystoles are suspected, an EPS and possible ablation may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-ii/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>His bundle electrocardiography, performed as part of an invasive EPS, shows that the non-conducted A wave (P wave on surface ECG) is followed by a His deflection, and not infrequently, a split His potential due to slowed intra-Hisian conduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79539\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79539 \">waveform 5</a>). Rarely, proximal His block does not demonstrate a His potential with the non-conducted A wave (P wave on the surface ECG), falsely suggesting that the block is in the AV node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-ii/abstract/3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125048993\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nearly all cases, the diagnosis of Mobitz type II second degree AV block can be made in a patient with an irregular pulse or suggestive symptoms (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, presyncope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> syncope) by obtaining a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). </p><p>For patients with 2:1 AV block in whom the distinction between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II second degree AV block cannot be made using the surface ECG alone, a long rhythm strip should be obtained or a previous ECG examined to try to find evidence of constant PR intervals preceding a non-conducted P wave, as well as to identify non-conducted P waves in a pattern other than 2:1 (eg, 3:2, 4:3, etc) that would suggest Mobitz type I second degree AV block. Additionally, carotid sinus massage may be performed, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> administered, to help distinguish the level of AV block. If the diagnosis remains uncertain following these measures, invasive electrophysiology studies can definitively diagnose the type of AV block and accurately identify the level of the block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of the patient with Mobitz type II second degree AV block depends on the presence and severity of any signs and symptoms related to the ventricular rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109619\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109619 \">algorithm 1</a>). Unstable patients require immediate pharmacologic therapy and, in most instances, should also receive temporary pacing to increase heart rate and cardiac output. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, assessment and treatment for any potentially reversible causes should occur, followed by placement of a permanent pacemaker for patients without an identifiable reversible etiology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125049064\"><span class=\"h2\">Unstable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block who are hemodynamically unstable should be urgently treated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109619\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109619 \">algorithm 1</a>) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and temporary cardiac pacing (either with transcutaneous or, if immediately available, transvenous pacing). The initial dose of atropine is 0.5 mg IV. This dose may be repeated every three to five minutes to a total dose of 3 mg.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability include hypotension, altered mental status, signs of shock, ongoing ischemic chest pain, and evidence of acute pulmonary edema. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dopamine</a> may be administered in hypotensive patients, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> is an option for patients with heart failure symptoms.

However, Mobitz type II second degree AV block is by nature unstable and frequently progresses to third degree (complete) AV block, so patients should be continuously monitored with transcutaneous pacing pads in place in the event of clinical deterioration.

Mobitz type II second degree AV block typically improves to lesser degrees of AV block within one week, and more minor conduction disturbances usually resolve within six weeks. As such, while these patients may initially require temporary cardiac pacing, permanent cardiac pacing should be reserved for patients with persistent high grade AV block following an adequate course of therapy for Lyme disease.

In second degree AV block, some atrial impulses fail to reach the ventricles. In Mobitz type II second degree AV block, the PR interval remains unchanged prior to a P wave that suddenly fails to conduct to the ventricles, whereas in Mobitz type I second degree AV block, there is progressive PR interval prolongation for several beats preceding a non-conducted P wave. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H125048228\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential etiologies of Mobitz type II second degree AV block include reversible (both pathologic and iatrogenic) and idiopathic causes that are similar to other degrees of AV block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62885 \">table 1</a>). Common potentially reversible causes include myocardial ischemia and medications. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with suspected Mobitz type II second degree AV block should be questioned about any history of heart disease, both congenital and acquired, as well as any recent cardiac procedures or medications that could predispose to AV conduction abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H125048600\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block will present with some degree of symptoms, though the severity of the symptoms can be quite variable. Symptoms may include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, syncope, or sudden cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"#H125048780\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobitz type II second degree AV block is identified by consistent unchanging PR intervals (which are usually normal in duration but may be prolonged) followed by the block of one or more P waves that fail to conduct to the ventricles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79539\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79539 \">waveform 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H125048864\" class=\"local\">'ECG findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with Mobitz type I second degree AV block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109619\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109619 \">algorithm 1</a>) depends on the presence or absence of symptoms, the hemodynamic status of the patient, the response to initial therapy, and the identification of any potentially reversible causes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block who are <strong>hemodynamically unstable</strong> should be urgently treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and temporary cardiac pacing (either with transcutaneous or, if immediately available, transvenous pacing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block who are <strong>hemodynamically stable</strong> do not require urgent therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> or temporary cardiac pacing. However, Mobitz type II second degree AV block is by nature unstable and frequently progresses to third degree (complete) AV block, so patients should be continuously monitored with transcutaneous pacing pads in place in the event of clinical deterioration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While stable patients are being monitored, reversible causes of Mobitz type II second degree AV block such as myocardial ischemia, increased vagal tone, hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia, and drugs that depress conduction, should be excluded in patients prior to implantation of a permanent pacemaker.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block who do not have a reversible etiology, we recommend implantation of a permanent pacemaker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We implant a dual chamber DDD pacemaker whenever possible in an effort to maintain physiologic AV synchrony.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-ii/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wenckebach, KF .
