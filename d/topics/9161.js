The side effects, including constipation and the potential for opioid use disorder, are contraindications to their use. The particular agent offered (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> CR) is especially associated with opioid use disorder. In very rare situations, where all other classes of medication indicated for painful diabetic neuropathy have been ineffective at maximally recommended or tolerated doses, a trial of a narcotic may be appropriate in patients without a history of substance use disorder.</p><p>Return to the beginning to try again.
