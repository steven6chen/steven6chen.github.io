LVADs have been shown to prolong survival in this clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support#H22787918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;, section on 'Clinical evidence'</a>), but there are several complications associated with mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) therapy. The postoperative course is complicated by frequent readmissions for bleeding, infection, pump thrombosis, right HF, and device malfunctions that require proper attention and management. </p><p>In North America, the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (<a href=\"http://www.intermacs.org/&amp;token=lmvGwDg43jbWTPc09l4hMOk/nH0KcPZDUlLfE9rOG3J+wfbp8CZvmmuZo20rc1mo&amp;TOPIC_ID=87834\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">INTERMACS</a>) collects clinical data on patients receiving MCSD therapy. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) issued guidelines for MCSD therapy in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In this topic, we will review ventricular assist device complications and long-term outpatient management, focusing on care of patients with continuous flow devices. The most commonly used devices today are HeartMate II (HMII), HeartWare (HW), and HeartMate 3 (HM3), which was just approved as a bridge to transplant device.</p><p>Indications for intermediate- and long-term device placement, mechanical options, and clinical trial data supporting device use are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13422789\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTPATIENT FOLLOW-UP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13422798\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous flow devices greatly alter the physical exam in supported patients. This presents a major challenge to clinicians and first responders in assessing these patients. Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) supported patients frequently have no palpable pulse and blood pressure may not be measurable by auscultation. Heart sounds are obscured by the hum of the device. Additionally, high placement of the external driveline can impede examination of the liver and assessment of hepatic congestion. </p><p>Underlying heart rate and rhythm are best assessed by precordial auscultation or electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p>Given the reduced arterial pulse pressure seen in these patients, blood pressure is best estimated using a Doppler ultrasound probe and sphygmomanometer (generally brachial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Doppler pressure measurements fall between arterial line systolic pressure and mean arterial pressure, tending to be closer to systolic pressure (eg, average Doppler ultrasound measurements 4.1 mmHg lower than systolic pressure and 9.5 mmHg higher than mean arterial pressure in one small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]). Doppler measurements of 70 to 80 mmHg are ideal while Doppler pressures above 90 mmHg warrant therapeutic intervention. Newer devices for blood pressure measurement such as the Terumo Elemano blood pressure monitor are also clinically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Elemano device uses double-cuff oscillometric slow deflation technology with results correlating well with the arterial line blood pressure with minimal underestimation of systolic pressure (on average 0.3 mmHg lower) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The device is easy to use and can be used for home blood pressure monitoring. The HeartMate 3 (HM3), the newest centrifugal pump, is programmed to slow down every two seconds and then return to the programmed speed. This can generate an artificial pulse while preventing stasis in the device. The presence of this intermittent pulse may facilitate measurement of blood pressure, but this has not been validated.</p><p>Another important element of the physical exam in mechanical device patients is assessment of the percutaneous driveline or lead for infection or damage. Percutaneous line infection continues to occur with all current devices. It is important to stabilize and anchor the driveline to avoid trauma and potential infection. Direct inspection of the driveline site for erythema, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> purulent discharge should be part of every clinician encounter. Culture of any drainage is recommended, and Gram stain is helpful for demonstrating neutrophils and infecting bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Abnormal swelling of the region surrounding the driveline site should be assessed by ultrasound to assess the presence, extent, and characteristics (inhomogeneity) of any fluid collections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Percutaneous lead damage is a frequent cause for device exchange. The driveline should be inspected for tears in the outer casing or tears at the connecting sites which can expose the internal wires. Repair of the driveline with safety clamps or reinforcement with tape may occasionally be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170216681\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ECG should be obtained to evaluate the heart rate and rhythm. A high index of suspicion is appropriate for patients with vague symptoms since sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in a patient supported by a VAD may present merely as fatigue. Sustained (particularly incessant) ventricular arrhythmias generally precipitate worsening right heart failure (HF) and therefore require prompt attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cardiac auscultation can provide evidence of continued pump function with the audible whirl of the axial or centrifugal pumps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], which is particularly helpful as a means of identifying a functioning device in patients with acute mental status change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170216687\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of cardiac function, optimization of device settings, and exclusion of chronic complications such as development of aortic regurgitation or thrombus formation are best achieved with echocardiograms. Though a routine echocardiogram is not required at each visit, an echocardiogram should be performed at regular intervals and is indicated if there are unexplained symptoms of fatigue, device alarms, defibrillator discharges, dizziness, or increased right HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14</a>]. Key features of the echocardiographic exam include assessment of ventricular size, interventricular septal position, valvular function (eg, mitral regurgitation and aortic valve opening), and assessment of inflow and outflow abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H170216693\" class=\"local\">'Device interrogation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170216693\"><span class=\"h2\">Device interrogation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Device mechanical function is evaluated at each visit by interrogating the device controller. For all current devices, alarm alerts can be reviewed along with flow estimates, pump power, and pump speed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow estimates for the HeartMate II (HMII) and HM3 devices range from 3 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> with normal flow in the range of 4 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>.

The average pump power six-month post-device implantation for the HMII is 6.8&plusmn;1.2 W with a normal range of 5 to 8 W [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For the HM3, the power range is usually between 3 and 4 W. For the HW, the normal power range is 3 to 7 W.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pump speed is adjusted with the aid of echocardiography to allow adequate filling of the LV without development of suction (excessive emptying) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The interventricular septum should be midline with some aortic valve opening to prevent the development of aortic insufficiency and thrombus formation, but the optimal frequency of aortic valve opening remains uncertain. No more than mild mitral regurgitation should be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The normal pump speed ranges for HMII, HM3, and HW are respectively 8000 to 10,000, 5000 to 6000, and 2400 to 3200. Suction events are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-adults-with-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices#H318471437\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of adults with mechanical circulatory support devices&quot;, section on 'Low flow'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the HMII and HM3 devices, the pulsatility index (displayed as Pulse Index on the monitor) is calculated by averaging the flow pulses seen with ventricular contraction over a 15-second period. The pulsatility index is inversely related to the amount of assistance provided by the pump and, for the HMII, generally averages 5.0&plusmn;0.9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with improved LV function such as occurs with exercise, myocardial recovery, or addition of inotropes will show an increase in the pulsatility index. Low pulsatility index indicates either low intravascular volume or minimal native cardiac function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538563223\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs) need to be treated with anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications such as device thrombosis and embolic stroke. Since these patients are also at risk for bleeding complications, anticoagulation should be carefully timed and titrated, and the following measures are suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication should generally be withheld for four to seven days before the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is implanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who have undergone recent stent implantation, early discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy is contraindicated due to the risk of stent thrombosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;</a>), so LVAD implantation should be delayed if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Earlier practice limited immediate postoperative anticoagulation with intravenous heparin to patients with specific additional indications for anticoagulation such as atrial fibrillation, prior embolic stroke, LV thrombus, left atrial thrombus, or LVAD low flow [13]. With the later observation of an increase in early pump thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H13422833\" class=\"local\">'Thrombosis'</a> below), we suggest use of intravenous heparin in all patients early after LVAD implantation (eg, postoperative day one or two) as recommended in the 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines once the chest tube drainage is no longer sanguineous and there is no other evidence of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin K antagonist therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (81 to 325 mg daily) is initiated after postoperative bleeding has stopped and chest tubes have been removed, typically days two to three postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) in clinical trials and from the manufacturer for the HeartMate II (HMII) is 2.0 to 3.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Due to the frequency of bleeding complications, some have suggested a target INR range of 1.5 to 2.5 for the HMII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, due to later reports of higher-than-expected rates of pump thrombosis, we suggest a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 for the HMII. (See <a href=\"#H13422833\" class=\"local\">'Thrombosis'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13422805\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE PERFORMANCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170216733\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise capacity in patients supported by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is generally monitored by six-minute walk distance, which is reported to the INTERMACS registry. </p><p>The exercise physiology of patients supported by LVADs is unique. Patients with heart failure (HF) have limited exercise capacity due to both central and peripheral effects. Unlike the earlier pulsatile LVAD devices, which had an automatic fill mode that ejected faster with an increase in pump filling and thus were preload responsive, the continuous flow LVADs work with a fixed pump speed that does not change with exercise. The speed is selected at rest to optimize unloading of the ventricle and to prevent excessive emptying (known as suction events) that could result in hypotension and arrhythmias. Maximum cardiac output of these devices is approximately 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. Additional cardiac output can be provided by the native heart. However, the right ventricle is unsupported. Also, long-term complications associated with LVADs such as aortic valve fusion and aortic regurgitation reduce the ability of the native heart supported by LVAD to improve exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Despite these limitations, rest and exercise hemodynamic measurements in patients with continuous flow LVADs are improved with lower pulmonary arterial and pulmonary wedge pressures and higher cardiac output. However, peak Vo<sub>2</sub> following LVAD implantation averages only 12 to 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The exercise response of the HeartMate II (HMII) is comparable to that seen with the pulsatile HeartMate XVE, and some preliminary studies have shown minimal enhancement of peak Vo<sub>2</sub> following pulsatile or continuous flow device placement. Electronic algorithms that modify pump response to increased workload are needed to improve cardiac performance with exercise.</p><p>Since improvement in peak Vo<sub>2</sub> has been limited, most studies have focused on using quality-of-life assessments or submaximal exercise testing with the six-minute walk test to evaluate the impact of device therapy. The HMII destination therapy trial (comparing continuous flow and pulsatile flow devices) demonstrated significant improvement in both quality of life and six-minute walk distance in the continuous flow device supported patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Stage D HF patients frequently come to surgery severely debilitated, bedbound, malnourished, and are often dependent on intravenous medications to support the circulation at rest. Following LVAD implantation, these patients become ambulatory and could benefit from intensive rehabilitation. Formal cardiac rehab programs post-LVAD have not been well described and most rehabilitation centers are unfamiliar with the operation of LVADs. Close collaboration between the device and rehabilitation centers is needed to develop successful rehabilitation programs. There are minimal data on the impact of aerobic training in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13422819\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS OF VADS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications following ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation include bleeding both in the perioperative period and in the long term because of the need for pharmacologic anticoagulation and also because of the development of acquired von Willebrand disease (aVWD) in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Safety Communication noted the risk of bleeding for the two LVADs approved by the FDA (the HeartMate II [HMII] and the HeartWare [HW]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Bleeding may occur from a leaky connection at the pump, from polyester grafts in the conduits (from inadequate pre-clotting, which is a procedure to seal the grafts), from mucosal surfaces (particularly gastrointestinal, including gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations [AVMs] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>)), and from intracranial vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Perioperative hemorrhage continues to be problematic with the newer continuous flow pumps despite less traumatic surgical implantation than was the case with the bulkier pulsatile pumps. </p><p>Bleeding more than a week post-device implantation may be precipitated or exacerbated by required anticoagulant therapy in combination with the development of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (aVWS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired von Willebrand syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein secreted by endothelial cells and platelets that promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation and stabilizes plasma coagulation factor VIII. The largest multimers of VWF are the most active forms of VWF.

The pathogenesis of aVWS with VAD therapy is likely similar to that in other clinical settings with high intravascular shear forces in which aVWS has been reported (eg, aortic stenosis).

Risk factors for thrombus formation include inadequate anticoagulation, atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable states, and coexistent infection, which increases the risk of coagulation abnormalities leading to thrombus formation. One of the major results for the initial six-month report of the MOMENTUM 3 trial was the absence of pump thrombosis in HeartMate 3 patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support#H7778338\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;, section on 'HeartMate 3'</a>.)</p><p>Pump thrombosis resulting in pump obstruction is associated with high mortality and can occur as an early or late complication. Published rates of pump thrombosis are probably underestimates, as pump thrombosis has been defined as occlusive thrombus formation in clinical trials and studies. For continuous flow devices, rates for device thrombosis have ranged from 0.01 to 0.11 per patient-year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/15,21,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21,33</a>]. </p><p>Studies performed in the United States have reported that the rate of pump thrombosis with the HMII device has increased since approximately March 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/15,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,34</a>], as noted in an FDA Safety Communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The rate of confirmed pump thrombosis at three months after implantation increased from 2.2 percent to 8.4 percent by January 1, 2013. Since March 2011, the median time from implantation to thrombosis declined from 18.6 months to 2.7 months. An INTERMACS analysis found that the rate of pump exchange or death from definite or probable pump thrombosis increased from 1 percent at six months after implantation before 2011 to 6 percent at six months in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The cause of this increased risk of pump thrombosis compared with previously reported thrombosis rates with this device is uncertain, though it was postulated that thrombosis may arise from deposition of fibrin and denatured protein adjacent to the inflow bearing. Other possibilities include changes in practice patterns by clinicians such as lowering of target INR to 1.5 to 2.5, intermittent interruption of anticoagulation due to bleeding from acquired von Willebrand&rsquo;s disease, and discontinuing the practice of bridging patients early postoperatively with intravenous heparin while adjusting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/33,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35,36</a>]. Other hypotheses include inadequate platelet therapy, overestimation of the partial prothrombin time, abnormal angulation of inflow or outflow cannulas leading to reduced blood flow and bearing heating with negative effects on coagulation proteins, infection, right HF, use of erythropoietic factors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other factors not yet identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>]. </p><p>Given these higher-than-expected rates of pump thrombosis, we suggest all patients with HMII devices receive early postoperative intravenous heparin with overlapping initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) using a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. We also suggest monitoring for pump thrombosis, including serial serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. (See <a href=\"#H538563223\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The PREVENT trial endorsed the use of a combination of surgical implant techniques, anticoagulation, and pump management strategies to minimize the risk of pump thrombosis in 300 HMII patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The surgical approaches included creation of an adequately sized pump pocket located inferiorly deep and lateral, positioning the inflow cannula parallel to the septum, the outflow cannula to the right of the septum, the pump beneath the diaphragm, and fixating the pump to the diaphragm or chest wall to prevent migration. For anticoagulation, the protocol included early heparin administration in the absence of significant postoperative bleeding, as well as early initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (with INR goal of 2 to 2.5) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. For pump management, speeds below 8600 rpm were to be avoided with a goal of &gt;9000 rpm with intermittent aortic valve opening. Maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure below 90 mmHg was recommended. Using these guidelines, the occurrence of pump thrombosis was reported as 4.8 percent at six months.</p><p>The diagnosis of pump thrombosis is suggested by the development of hemolysis and by changes in pump performance. There is a continuum of symptoms depending on the extent of clot with some patients asymptomatic while others present with severe HF with or without multi-organ failure. Clinical manifestations of hemolysis include red or reddish-brown urine, worsening renal function, elevated serum LDH (&gt;1000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], decreased serum haptoglobin, and increased free plasma hemoglobin (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;</a>). The change in pump performance most suggestive of thrombosis is the development of marked transient increases in power consumption (power spikes) or gradual increase in power requirement of at least 2 Watts. When pump thrombosis is present, pump flow decreases and increased pump speed is required to maintain adequate flow. </p><p>Echocardiography performed at increments of LVAD speed is helpful in identifying pump thrombosis. Lack of decline in LV diastolic dimension with increasing pump speeds suggests obstruction to flow. An echocardiography ramp test for speed optimization and diagnosis of device thrombosis has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Early pump obstruction generally requires immediate pump exchange or heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. In the above report on increased rate of pump thrombosis, thrombosis was managed by heart transplantation in 11 patients (with one death) and by pump replacement in 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In 40 patients with 40 thromboses not treated by transplantation or pump replacement, the actuarial mortality rate was 48.2 percent at six months after diagnosis of pump thrombosis.</p><p>Late pump thrombosis can sometimes be successfully treated with addition of intravenous heparin while chronic anticoagulation is intensified.

When an LVAD supports the left side of the heart and normal cardiac output is conducted via venous return to the right heart, the right ventricle sometimes fails since there is often underlying biventricular dysfunction. In addition, the LVAD tends to decrease LV pressure and size, which may lead to a distortion of the geometry of the right ventricle, resulting in septal bowing. This septal bowing can cause obstruction to right ventricular outflow as well as worsening right ventricular (RV) mechanics with decrease in RV stroke volume and an increase in tricuspid regurgitation. The incidence of right HF in the perioperative period following LV support varies from approximately 5 to 50 percent, depending on the definition used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].&nbsp;Some studies define right HF as the need for right ventricular mechanical support, whereas other studies define it as need for right ventricular mechanical support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or prolonged therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> or intravenous inotropic therapy. </p><p>Predictors of RV failure in the perioperative period include hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters such as RV stroke work index &lt;250, right atrial pressure &gt;15 mmHg, severe RV dysfunction on echocardiogram, renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, and reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE &lt;0.75 cm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87846 \">table 1</a>).&nbsp;Although predictive models have been developed to estimate risk, there is no consensus on how best to predict early right HF and clearly no data on the development of chronic right HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/13,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,16</a>]. </p><p>Evaluation of patients with suspected right HF includes right heart catheterization and transthoracic echocardiography, which is useful as a guide for optimizing LVAD device settings to minimize septal bowing during device support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,39-42</a>].

Late onset right HF may result from continued progression of intrinsic right ventricular dysfunction, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, progression of tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, or device malfunction or thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Frequently, the patients are treated with diuresis with or without inotropic support.

Continuous axial flow pumps have smaller surface areas of foreign material, lesser pump movement inside the body, and smaller drivelines compared with the pulsatile pumps with consequent lower infection rates (eg, 0.37 versus 3.49 driveline infections per patient-year for the HMII versus HeartMate I [HMI] devices) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The development of significant aortic regurgitation decreases the efficacy of device support and some cases require aortic valve surgery. Patients who develop symptomatic aortic insufficiency post-VAD implant should be treated with an increase in pump speed. If the patient remains asymptomatic, the pump speed should be set to maintain intermittent AV opening under echocardiographic guidance. Pathology specimens at time of autopsy or explant of hearts at transplant have demonstrated fusion of aortic valve leaflets. The mechanism underlying the fusion of the valve leaflets is unclear. </p><p>Park&rsquo;s central stitch (a simple central coaptation stitch) has been used to reduce aortic regurgitation in patients on continuous flow LVAD support who develop significant aortic regurgitation and some surgeons have proposed prophylactic use of this stitch at the time of device implantation to prevent this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

There can be failure of the external components (which can usually be replaced), or of the internal components (which can be life threatening). Device failure was far more common with the first generation pulsatile pumps, as they had more moving parts. However, they did have a hand pump back-up system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The second generation axial flow pumps (eg, HMII) have only one moving part (the rotor). They are more durable with a much lower rate of device failure. However, the presence of bearings can lead to wear, tissue ingrowth, and thrombus formation. The third generation magnetic levitation pumps have no bearings to wear out and are expected to be much more durable. </p><p>Pump stoppage of a continuous flow MCSD requires emergency expert medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Definitive therapy for pump stoppage is surgical pump exchange. For patients unable to undergo surgery, a temporary stabilizing maneuver is to percutaneously occlude the outflow cannula to halt the backflow of blood through the valveless outflow cannula. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13422868\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic events remain a leading cause of long-term mortality in patients with LVADs. The incidence of stroke has not decreased with the transition from pulsatile to continuous flow devices.

In a retrospective review of neurologic events in 307 LVAD patients, 43 patients (24 of 167 HMI, 19 of 140 HMII patients) had a stroke (n = 35) or transient ischemic attack by a mean of 92 days postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Multivariate analysis identified postoperative infection and prior history of stroke as the strongest predictors of a neurologic event. Strokes in LVAD patients tend to occur with greater frequency in the right hemisphere, which is suggestive of a cardioembolic rather than atherogenic source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. </p><p>The HW device is associated with greater rates of stroke than seen with the HMII (or HM3) device. An FDA Safety Communication noted that the preliminary report for a clinical trial comparing the HW device with the HMII for destination therapy included a 28.7 percent rate of stroke over two years for the HW device as compared with 12.1 percent for the HMII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The ENDURANCE trial compared event rates at two years with HW and HMII devices in nontransplant-eligible patients: in the HW arm, 17.6 percent had an ischemic stroke and 14.9 percent had a hemorrhagic stroke compared with 8.1 percent ischemic stroke and 6 percent hemorrhagic stroke in the HMII arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Rates of stroke are similar with HMII and HM3 devices.

Control of blood pressure is one intervention that may be effective in preventing CVA as suggested by data in HW patients.

This is particularly true in patients with a prior history of ventricular arrhythmias. Generally, ventricular tachycardia is well tolerated given the circulatory support; however, persistent ventricular arrhythmias can predispose the patient to the development of right HF.

Blood pressure is best estimated in these patients using a Doppler ultrasound probe and sphygmomanometer. (See <a href=\"#H13422798\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram is indicated in continuous flow LVAD-supported patients if there are unexplained symptoms of fatigue, device alarms, defibrillator discharges, dizziness, or increased right heart failure (HF). (See <a href=\"#H170216687\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HeartMate II device interrogation includes review of alarm alerts, flow, pump power, pulsatility index (Pulse Index), and pump speed. (See <a href=\"#H170216693\" class=\"local\">'Device interrogation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients supported by VADs are treated with systemic anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications such as device thrombosis and embolic stroke. However, too early or too aggressive anticoagulation should be avoided to reduce the risk of bleeding complications. (See <a href=\"#H538563223\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications following VAD implantation include bleeding, both in the perioperative period (exacerbated by the coagulopathic effect of cardiopulmonary bypass) and long term (with the development of acquired von Willebrand syndrome [aVWS] and arteriovenous malformations). They also include acute and chronic right HF, device thrombosis, thromboembolism, infection, aortic regurgitation, ventricular arrhythmias, and hemolysis. (See <a href=\"#H13422819\" class=\"local\">'Complications of VADS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical problems following VAD implantation can include malposition of the inflow cannula, kinking of outflow grafts, bend relief disconnection, cable damage, and device failure. (See <a href=\"#H13422861\" class=\"local\">'Technical problems and device failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with VADs are at risk for bleeding from a leaky pump connection, from grafts on the conduits, from mucosal surfaces (particularly gastrointestinal), and intracranially. (See <a href=\"#H13422826\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of aortic regurgitation has been observed in up to 25 percent of patients supported by a continuous flow LVAD. Significant aortic regurgitation decreases the efficacy of device support and some cases require aortic valve surgery.
