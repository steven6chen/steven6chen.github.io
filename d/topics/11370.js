Management is symptomatic.</p><p>The main clinical features of MSA are parkinsonism, autonomic failure, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal signs in varying combinations. Additional manifestations can include sleep disorders, breathing disorders, and depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical characteristics'</a>.)</p><p>The motor symptoms in MSA are highly resistant to pharmacologic treatment. However, the autonomic symptoms may respond to pharmacotherapy. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy are helpful for the supportive care of patients with MSA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no effective medications for the ataxia and gait abnormalities that predominate in MSA-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Furthermore, the parkinsonian manifestations of bradykinesia and rigidity in MSA are resistant to treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy is important for fall prevention, reduction in contractures, and maintenance of mobility while possible. Therapists are also helpful in determining requirements for and facilitating walker and wheelchair use when a patient becomes nonambulatory. Occupational therapy may promote longer independence in performing activities of daily living. Additionally, in-home visits for safety evaluation and driving evaluations are beneficial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin injection is often useful in alleviating symptoms from focal dystonias that occur in MSA, such as cervical dystonia and blepharospasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dystonia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dystonia&quot;, section on 'Botulinum toxin injections'</a>.)</p><p/><p>For patients with anterocollis, it is important to differentiate dystonia from myopathy as the cause. This should be done before using botulinum toxin, which may worsen symptoms when myopathy is the cause. Electromyography usually clarifies the picture, although biopsy may be necessary when the diagnosis is uncertain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech therapy referral early in the course of disease allows objective determination of the progression of dysphagia. The need for percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement should be assessed by videofluoroscopic swallow evaluation and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal positive pressure ventilation with either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) should be considered if a patient develops respiratory complications secondary to laryngeal stridor. In a study of seven patients who had MSA with predominantly autonomic dysfunction, stridor during sleep was the most commonly observed respiratory abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Three of these patients experienced sudden death during sleep.</p><p/><p>In cases of severe, life-threatening stridor, tracheostomy becomes a necessary intervention. Thus, the option of tracheostomy placement should be discussed with patients in advance. However, it is possible that tracheostomy can aggravate central sleep apnea. This conclusion comes from a study that evaluated seven patients with probable MSA who received tracheostomy for moderate or severe vocal cord abductor paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All had frequent central sleep apneas. In addition, the apnea-hypopnea index (the total number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep) increased after tracheostomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Levodopa and dopaminergic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main role of levodopa in patients with suspected MSA is diagnostic; a poor or unsustained response to levodopa therapy is generally observed in patients with MSA and can help to distinguish MSA-P from idiopathic Parkinson disease. However, some patients with clinically probable MSA do better on levodopa treatment than off it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Levodopa responsiveness'</a>.)</p><p>Therefore, we suggest a trial of levodopa for patients with suspected MSA. Levodopa is given with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (eg, levodopa-carbidopa) in escalating doses up to 1000 mg of levodopa daily as necessary and tolerated over a three-month period. The total daily dose must be increased to 900 or 1000 mg before a trial of levodopa can be declared a failure.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a> has been used in doses up to 300 mg per day to treat MSA, but it is no more effective than levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The role for dopamine agonists is limited, both for the older (pergolide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>) and newer agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a>). They rarely lead to motor benefit and frequently exacerbate orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal symptoms, and sleep disorders that are prevalent in MSA. Patients who do not respond to levodopa are unlikely to respond to dopamine agonists, so their use should be avoided in this situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthostatic hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of orthostatic hypotension is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The plasma volume expander <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> acetate is the medication of first choice for chronic orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction. This agent has a long duration of action and is well-tolerated by most patients with chronic autonomic failure. Patients treated with fludrocortisone must be monitored for the development of edema and worsening seated or supine hypertension. These side effects may necessitate discontinuation or dosage reduction. Potassium supplementation is usually required, particularly when higher doses are used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension&quot;, section on 'Fludrocortisone'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=droxidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Droxidopa</a>, an orally active norepinephrine precursor, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It has been used for orthostatic hypotension treatment in Japan for years, and its efficacy was demonstrated in two small studies that included patients with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension#H6612141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension&quot;, section on 'Pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Second line agents for orthostatic hypotension include the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonists <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a>. Supine hypertension can be a significant side effect with these medications. Raising the head of the bed by 30 to 45 degrees may help ameliorate this problem.</p><p>Supplementary agents for orthostatic hypotension include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a>, and erythropoietin. These agents may be used in combination therapy with first or second line agents in patients with persistent symptoms. However, there are anecdotal reports suggesting that pyridostigmine causes worsening parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Nonpharmacologic measures are important components of the therapy of chronic orthostatic hypotension. These include removal of offending medications, patient education and physical maneuvers (eg, arising slowly from supine to sitting, raising the head of the bed 10 to 20 degrees, custom-fitted elastic stockings that extend to the waist), increased salt and water intake, and avoidance of precipitating factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Postprandial hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of postprandial hypotension is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately.

The following general suggestions may be helpful in selected patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat small meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat low carbohydrate meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid salt restriction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid standing up suddenly or standing still after meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walk between meals; if walking is not tolerated, lie semirecumbent for 90 minutes after meals</p><p/><p>The somatostatin analogue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> can minimize postprandial hypotension. However, octreotide must be given subcutaneously 30 minutes before each meal. It is expensive, and often leads to side effects such as diarrhea and pain at the injection site. Therefore, it should be reserved for the most severely symptomatic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Urogenital symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For detrusor hyperreflexia, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxybutynin</a> (2.5 to 5 mg two or three times daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolterodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolterodine</a> (2 to 4 mg daily) may prevent overactive bladder. However, these drugs can cause confusion in susceptible patients and can worsen constipation.</p><p>For bladder atony, intermittent self-catheterization should be used for retention or residual volume &gt;100 mL.</p><p>The treatment of erectile dysfunction is discussed elsewhere.
