The relationships between SLE and menstrual function, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy are discussed in this topic review. Issues related to pregnancy in women with SLE,pregnancy in patients with impaired renal function, and hormonal contraception in women with SLE are presented in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to contraception in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MENSTRUAL FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menstrual irregularities are common in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual irregularity, especially oligomenorrhea, is a common clinical feature in women with SLE. As an example, among 94 women with SLE under the age of 45 without exposure to alkylating agents, oligomenorrhea occurred in 54 percent. Menstrual irregularities were associated with higher levels of prolactin, higher disease activity, and lower levels of progesterone&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These observations suggest that SLE activity may result in hormonal abnormalities that may contribute to menstrual irregularity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menorrhagia has been noted in 12 to 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Thrombocytopenia, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the use of glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may contribute to the heavy menstrual flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporary or even permanent early (or premature) amenorrhea has been noted in 17 to 24 percent of patients. Two major mechanisms have been identified: There is an association of SLE with autoimmune ovarian injury and with the administration of immunosuppressive agents (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> [CYC]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A retrospective review of women treated for lupus nephritis illustrated the importance of total drug exposure with CYC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sustained early amenorrhea developed in none of 16 treated only with pulse glucocorticoids, 2 of 16 treated with seven monthly pulses of CYC, and 9 of 23 treated with 15 or more monthly pulses of CYC. Amenorrhea began within the first seven months in one-half of affected patients, occurring earlier in women over the age of 25. The amenorrhea was usually permanent, with recovery occurring only in women receiving the shorter pulse CYC regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The age of the patient at which amenorrhea due to therapy with CYC occurred was examined in another study of 35 women who underwent pulse CYC therapy; the older the woman at the initiation of therapy, the more likely she was to experience ovarian failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The administration of as little as 3000 mg of CYC was associated with ovarian failure in some older patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General toxicity of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Gonadal toxicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 961 patients with SLE failed to show any increased prevalence of premature ovarian failure in lupus patients when compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to these effects, the menstrual cycle also can affect lupus. In particular, lupus may be more likely to flare in the premenstrual period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MENOPAUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menopause may or may not be associated with a diminution in the symptoms and signs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

One observational study of over 300 women with SLE noted similar rates of improvement in SLE symptoms in those during the premenopausal, postmenopausal, and perimenopausal periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Menopause brings on several new concerns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal women have a greater risk of coronary disease as do women with SLE, especially those treated with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal women have a greater risk of osteoporosis as do women with SLE, especially those treated with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26599985\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and a progestin can decrease the risk of osteoporosis and improve the mood and sense of wellbeing and libido.

The largest study, of 351 postmenopausal women with SLE, suggested only a small increase in the risk of a disease flare in association with estrogen and intermittent progestin use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Data from the Nurses' Health Study found that, when compared with women who were never treated with estrogen replacement therapy, the relative risk of SLE was 2.5 in current users and 1.8 in past users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Thrombocytopenia, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the use of glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can contribute to menorrhagia. Temporary or even permanent early (or premature) amenorrhea may result from autoimmune ovarian injury or from the administration of cytotoxic agents, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (CYC). Increased age and greater total drug exposure increase the risk of CYC-related ovarian failure. Hormonal effects influence disease; lupus may be more likely to flare in the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle.
