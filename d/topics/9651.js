Histopathology of the involved lymph nodes differentiates Kikuchi disease from several more serious conditions that it may mimic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the pathogenesis of Kikuchi disease is unknown, the clinical presentation, course, and histologic changes suggest an immune response of T cells and histiocytes to an infectious agent. Numerous inciting agents have been proposed, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], human herpesvirus 6, human herpesvirus 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus B19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], paramyxoviruses, parainfluenza virus, <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em>, and <em>Toxoplasma</em>. In one report, EBV was detected by in situ hybridization in tissue in all of 10 patients examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], but immunohistochemistry detected EBV-encoded protein in only 1 of these patients. An observation that is consistent with a viral etiology is increased levels of interferon-alpha and of other proteins stimulated by interferon-alpha including 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and tubuloreticular structures in the cytoplasm of stimulated lymphocytes, histiocytes, and vascular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Apoptotic cell death mediated by cytotoxic CD8-positive T lymphocytes is the principal mechanism of cellular destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Histiocytes may act as enhancers. The apoptosis appears to be induced by the Fas-Fas ligand system. Morphologic characteristics of apoptotic cells including nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation along the nuclear membrane with intact organelles and histiocytes phagocytosing karyorrhectic debris (apoptotic bodies) are found on transmission electron microscopy.</p><p>A possible role for interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-6 in the pathogenesis of this syndrome is suggested by one study of four men with biopsy-proven Kikuchi disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During the acute phase of illness, these patients had elevated serum levels of interferon-gamma and IL-6 but not interferon-alpha, tumor necrosis factor, or IL-2. The interferon-gamma and IL-6 levels returned to normal during convalescence. Subsequent reports support this role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Analysis of lymph node biopsies in patients with Kikuchi disease show T-bet-expressing CD4 cells accompanied by T-bet-positive CD8 and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Kikuchi syndrome shares sex and age predisposition as well as histologic features with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Tubuloreticular structures in the lymphocytes and endothelial cells in patients with SLE have been observed to be similar to those seen in Kikuchi disease. One ultrastructural study proposed that Kikuchi syndrome reflects a self-limited, SLE-like autoimmune condition caused by virus-infected transformed lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While initially described in young women, Kikuchi disease clearly also occurs in men. The ratio of affected males to females in three series was 1:4, 1:1.6, and 1:1.26, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In a Korean report of 20 individuals younger than 18 years of age with Kikuchi disease, the gender distribution was equal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Most patients are younger than 40 years of age, but this condition has been reported in patients ranging in age from 6 to 80 years, most of whom were previously well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. The mean age at presentation in a United States series was 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethnic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although initially described in two separate cases from Japan, Kikuchi disease has since been found in all racial and ethnic groups and in many countries, including the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>]. In a study of 88 patients with Kikuchi disease in the United States, 75 percent were Caucasian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The frequency of this condition varies widely in different groups, but it has been most frequently reported from Asia. In a series of 920 lymph node biopsies from Saudi Arabia, only 5 (0.5 percent) had changes characteristic of Kikuchi disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] compared with 5.7 percent in a report from Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a Korean study of 147 patients presenting to an outpatient clinic, Kikuchi disease (34.7 percent) and tuberculous adenitis (22.4 percent) were the most common causes of cervical adenitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical presentation of Kikuchi disease is fever and cervical lymphadenopathy in a previously well young woman. Fever is a primary symptom in 30 to 50 percent of patients. It is typically low grade and persists for about one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], rarely for up to one month. In one study of 86 children with Kikuchi disease, the median duration of fever was 9 days but was more prolonged in those with higher fever (&ge;39.0&deg;C), leukopenia, and larger lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective literature review that described 244 patients with Kikuchi disease, the most common signs and symptoms were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphadenopathy (100 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (35 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash (10 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis (7 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue (7 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatosplenomegaly (3 percent)</p><p/><p>A variety of other symptoms and physical findings occur sporadically in patients with Kikuchi disease. These include rigors, myalgia, arthralgia, and chest and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Night sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss have also been reported and appear to be more prominent in patients with extranodal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There have been several reports of disease limited to the mediastinum, with no cervical involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Mesenteric lymphadenitis may mimic appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation in pediatric patients appears to be similar to that in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In one study, fever and rash were more common and generalized lymphadenopathy was less common in children compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The risk of evolution into an autoimmune syndrome may be higher than in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Occasional reports describe Kikuchi disease associated with other conditions, such as Still's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], cryptogenic organizing pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>], and following B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient skin rashes similar to rubella or drug-induced eruptions may be seen in sicker patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Occasionally, the rash is pruritic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Some reports describe skin manifestations in up to 40 percent of patients, including facial erythema; erythematous macules, patches, papules, or plaques; scattered indurated lesions; ulcers; polymorphous light eruptions; leukocytoclastic vasculitis; scales; pruritus; alopecia; conjunctival injection; and oral ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/1,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,44,45</a>]. The presence of a malar &quot;butterfly rash&quot; should raise the diagnosis of SLE that, as noted above, has been associated with Kikuchi disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymph node involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymph node involvement is usually cervical and localized in Kikuchi disease. As an example, all 79 patients in a Chinese report had cervical node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In the United States series of 108 patients, 83 had lymphadenopathy localized to one site, usually cervical and particularly posterior cervical; only 3 patients had bilateral cervical adenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There may be more extensive node involvement or involvement of other sites. These sites include the axillary, epitrochlear, mediastinal, mesenteric, inguinal, intraparotid, iliac, retrocrural, celiac, and peripancreatic nodes.</p><p>The nodes are usually only moderately enlarged (1 to 2 cm in diameter) but occasionally are much larger (&le;7 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. They are typically firm, smooth, discrete, and mobile. The nodal enlargement is often associated with dull or acute pain.</p><p>Rarely, nodal enlargement may be minimal or only mediastinal, or retroperitoneal nodes may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The diagnosis is unlikely to be considered prior to biopsy in such patients who may present as a fever of unknown origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aseptic meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>], meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], acute cerebellar symptoms with tremor and ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], thyroiditis and parotid enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], polymyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], hemophagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>], panuveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], bilateral papillary conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], brachial neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], and peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] have all been reported. In addition, there are reports of antiphospholipid syndrome with multiorgan failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with Kikuchi disease have a normal complete blood count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], although leukopenia is seen in up to 43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/16,26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26,28</a>]. Atypical lymphocytes have been reported in up to 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Other reported findings include thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, in those with severe disease, anemia of chronic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/1,28,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28,67</a>].</p><p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be normal but was elevated to more than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> in 70 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

In two patients, increased numbers of mature hemophagocytic histiocytes in the bone marrow led to the misdiagnosis of virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor, and lupus erythematosus preparations are generally negative. Some patients initially diagnosed with Kikuchi disease have subsequently developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,68</a>], and an ANA test should be performed in patients with suspected Kikuchi syndrome who have features suggestive of SLE in order to exclude this diagnosis. One report describes a transient rise in anti-DNA and antiribonuclear protein antibody levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Serology for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), toxoplasmosis, <em>Y. enterocolitica</em>, cat scratch disease, and other infectious agents is often performed since these infections are considered in the differential diagnosis of fever and lymphadenopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Kikuchi disease is made by lymph node biopsy. Biopsy should be performed, despite the self-limited nature of this syndrome, in order to exclude more serious conditions requiring aggressive therapy such as lymphoma. Patients with Kikuchi disease have been misdiagnosed as having lymphoma and treated with cytotoxic agents when physicians and pathologists are unfamiliar with this entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other conditions that have been confused with Kikuchi disease are tuberculous adenitis, lymphogranuloma venereum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], and Kawasaki disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>Excisional biopsy is most often recommended. However, fine needle aspiration is increasingly useful in the hands of experienced cytopathologists using smears and cell block preparations designed to preserve lymph node architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histology of the lymph node in Kikuchi disease can usually be easily differentiated from most known infectious conditions in the differential diagnosis of fever and lymphadenopathy but not from that seen in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15,19,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19,45</a>]. Yellowish necrotic foci may rarely be noted on the cut surface of the node. Microscopic examination usually shows paracortical foci often with necrosis and a histiocytic cellular infiltrate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69416\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69416 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50349\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50349 \">picture 2</a>). These foci may be single or multiple. The capsule may be infiltrated, and perinodal inflammation is common. The necrotizing process is often confined to circumscribed areas of eosinophilic fibrinoid material with irregular distribution of fragments of nuclear debris. Overt coagulative necrosis is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of Kikuchi disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The histologic appearance changes as the disease progresses.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early biopsies in the &quot;proliferative phase&quot; show follicular hyperplasia and paracortical expansion by lymphocytes, T and B cell blasts, plasmacytoid monocytes, and histiocytes with numerous apoptoses in the background.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the &quot;proliferative phase,&quot; the presence of numerous blast cells raises the differential diagnoses of lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and herpes simplex infection. Preservation of the nodal architecture, the polyclonal infiltrate, and negative viral immunohistochemistry exclude these conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Later biopsies in the &quot;necrotizing phase&quot; show necrosis without a neutrophilic infiltrate associated with progressive dominance of histiocytes as the major cell type. The histiocytes often have crescentic nuclei and contain phagocytosed debris. Immunohistochemical stains show CD68-positive plasmacytoid monocytes and histiocytes with predominantly CD8-positive T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The absence of neutrophils in the &quot;necrotizing phase&quot; is helpful in distinguishing this condition from SLE and drug-induced lymphadenopathy.</p><p/><p>Xanthomatous appearance seems to be a distinct histologic variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>The histologic differential diagnosis includes SLE, herpes simplex lymphadenitis, and lymphoma (non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin). In SLE, hematoxylin bodies and plasma cells are also seen. In herpes simplex lymphadenitis, there are fewer surrounding mononuclear cells, and neutrophils are usually present. Necrosis associated with Hodgkin lymphoma usually includes neutrophils, and, in contrast with Kikuchi disease, the large atypical cells (Reed-Sternberg cell variants) are CD15, CD30, and CD45 positive. It has been suggested that plasmacytoid dendritic cells more frequently infiltrate the lymph nodes in Kikuchi disease than in either reactive lymphadenitis or T or B cell lymphoma, irrespective of the age of the Kikuchi lesion, and thus they may be useful indicators for the cytologic diagnosis of Kikuchi disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Necrotic lymph nodes have been misdiagnosed as metastatic disease from head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells are abundant around necrotic areas and may be helpful in differentiating this from SLE and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with the characteristic histopathologic changes seen in lymph nodes of patients with Kikuchi disease, the histologic features in skin biopsy samples are highly variable and nonspecific. Common histologic findings that may be present include epidermal change (most commonly with necrotic keratinocytes), non-neutrophilic karyorrhectic debris, basal vacuolar change, papillary dermal edema, and a lymphocytic infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In a review of skin biopsies from 16 cases, features noted included vacuolar interface changes (in 75 percent), necrotic keratinocytes (in 68 percent), karyorrhexis (in 100 percent), superficial and deep lymphohistiocytic infiltration (in 100 and 56 percent, respectively), and panniculitis (in 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Nodal cortical attenuation and its ratio to adjacent muscle on CT imaging may be used to differentiate Kikuchi disease from nodal reactive hyperplasia and tuberculous lymphadenopathy, if the lymphadenopathy is not necrotic.

Differentiating features on power Doppler ultrasonography between Kikuchi disease and tuberculous adenitis have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In Kikuchi disease compared with tuberculous adenitis, lymph nodes are smaller, less rounded, more likely to have an echogenic hilum, more likely to be abnormal in the posterior cervical region, less likely to have internal calcifications (0 versus 36 percent), and less likely to be necrotic (9 versus 71 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No effective treatment has been established for Kikuchi disease.

Affected patients should be followed for some years because they can develop systemic lupus erythematosus, and recurrences of Kikuchi disease can occasionally continue for many years. One patient, for example, had four episodes of lymphadenopathy over 18 years and another had two episodes separated by 6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/67,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kikuchi disease is self-limited in the majority of patients, although recurrences have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/67,71,91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,71,91,92</a>]. In a series of 108 patients, 59 of 64 patients (92 percent) for whom data were available were alive and well at a median of 32 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among 102 patients in Korea between 2001 and 2006, 3 developed systemic lupus erythematosus, 8 experienced early relapse, and 13 had late recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Recurrent cases were symptomatic for longer than initial cases. A positive fluorescent antinuclear antibody test was associated with a higher risk of recurrent disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2084079\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kikuchi disease is a rare, benign condition of unknown cause usually characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy and fever. Histopathology of the involved lymph nodes differentiates Kikuchi disease from several more serious conditions that it may mimic. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the pathogenesis of Kikuchi disease is unknown, the clinical presentation, course, and histologic changes suggest an immune response of T cells and histiocytes to an infectious agent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although initially described in young women, Kikuchi disease also occurs in men. Most patients are younger than 40 years of age and were previously well. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kikuchi disease has been most frequently reported from Asia but has been found in all racial and ethnic groups and in many countries. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Ethnic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common clinical presentation is low-grade fever and cervical lymphadenopathy in a previously well young woman. Patients may also have fatigue, joint pain, rash, arthritis, hepatosplenomegaly, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node involvement is usually cervical and localized. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Kikuchi disease is made by lymph node biopsy. Microscopic examination usually shows paracortical foci often with necrosis and a histiocytic cellular infiltrate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69416\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69416 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50349\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50349 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibodies should be performed in patients with suspected Kikuchi disease who have features suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in order to exclude SLE. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Serologic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No effective treatment has been established for Kikuchi disease. Signs and symptoms usually resolve within one to four months. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kikuchi-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Yen A, Fearneyhough P, Raimer SS, Hudnall SD.
