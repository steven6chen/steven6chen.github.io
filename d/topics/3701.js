Much of this is due to the lack of objective findings. Nonetheless, patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> have real symptoms and are not malingerers. The prevalence of this syndrome is unclear in part due to difficulties in proving the diagnosis.</p><p>The condition has long been recognized and many different terms have been used to describe it (eg, DaCosta's syndrome, effort syndrome, soldier's heart, neurasthenia, myalgic <span class=\"nowrap\">encephalitis/encephalomyelitis,</span> Iceland disease, Akureyri disease, and Royal Free disease, chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> are reviewed here.

In 2015, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) redefined the diagnostic criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F99875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99875 \">table 1</a>) and suggested the name change to systemic exertion intolerance disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The IOM diagnostic criteria focus on the most specific features of the disease. As with previous definitions, symptoms should be present for at least six months and have moderate, substantial, or severe intensity at least one-half of the time. Other criteria include: postexertional malaise, sleep problems, cognitive impairment, and orthostatic-related symptoms.</p><p>These clinical case definitions are standard epidemiologic tools that are employed when there is no diagnostic test for a specific disorder. They are &quot;intentionally restrictive, to maximize the chances that research studies will detect significant associations if such associations truly exist&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Though a clinical case definition is a well-established instrument, its strict application may not always be appropriate in the evaluation of a specific patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is unclear in part due to difficulties in proving the diagnosis. In one study of 1000 consecutive patients in a primary care clinic, for example, 8.5 percent had debilitating fatigue of at least six months&rsquo; duration without apparent cause; however, only 15 percent of these patients satisfied the clinical definition for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In resource-rich settings, studies have reported that approximately 10 to 25 percent of patients seen in primary care practices complain of chronic fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A similar population-based survey in India found that 12 percent of patients complained of fatigue for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-fatigue\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with fatigue&quot;</a>.)</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> represents a very small subset of those who complain of chronic fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. A random digit-dialing survey in Wichita, Kansas estimated the point prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> to be 235 per 100,000; a one-year telephone survey follow-up among those not fatigued or fatigued for &lt;6 months found the incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> to be 180 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a prospective cohort study of over 4000 patients in a health maintenance organization, the estimated crude point prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> ranged from 75 to 267 cases per 100,000 persons; the point prevalence of chronic fatigue not meeting the syndromic definition was strikingly higher, ranging from 1775 to 6321 cases per 100,000 persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, even among patients with fatigue of at least six months&rsquo; duration, the prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is well under 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is primarily a disorder of young to middle-aged adults, but cases in children have been recognized. It may also occur in older adults, although coexisting medical conditions usually preclude its consideration in this population. Most series report that <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is about twice as common in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Few cases have been reported in minorities or among lower socioeconomic groups. However, the incidence in these groups may be underestimated due to their lack of equivalent access to health care institutions in which <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is studied.</p><p>Cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> usually arise in a sporadic manner, although closely related (if not identical) illnesses have occurred in outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. Other names for these types of outbreaks include epidemic neuromyasthenia and myalgic encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, careful investigations of a putative &quot;cluster&quot; of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> cases failed to reveal that there was a true epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPOSED ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considerable effort has gone into investigating possible causes of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. Among the many possible precipitants, the ones that have been most thoroughly studied are viruses, immune dysfunction, endocrine-metabolic dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been intense interest in whether certain viruses could be responsible for causing <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), and others. None has been proven to cause <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70034228\"><span class=\"h3\">Epstein-Barr virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV received a great deal of attention in the mid-1980s as a possible etiologic agent for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. This hypothesis was based upon three observations. First, EBV persists for life and reactivates frequently, thereby affording the virus the biologic potential for chronic illness. Second, patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> were often found to possess higher than expected titers of antibodies to EBV capsid and early antigens, or to lack antibodies to EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA), each suggestive of recent or active infection. Third, some patients clearly attributed the onset of their illness to a mononucleosis-like infection.</p><p>However, later observations suggest that the proposed relation between EBV infection and <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is not correct. The serologic profiles of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> are nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24</a>]. One study, for example, found that EBV serologies were unable to distinguish between 15 patients with severe fatigue of unknown etiology for two months, and over 100 patients with less severe fatigue or completely healthy controls. In addition, most cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> either evolve insidiously or follow influenza-like or gastroenteric-type illnesses rather than mononucleosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70034235\"><span class=\"h3\">Other viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to EBV, a number of other viruses have been proposed as the cause of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. These include retroviruses, human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), enteroviruses, coxsackie B virus, Ross river virus, and Borna disease virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Some observations regarding these viruses have included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to these and other viruses were initially found to be more prevalent in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> than in controls.

In addition, a seroepidemiologic study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for over 40 different infectious agents failed to reveal an association with any particular organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Neither of two interferon-induced antiviral pathways was activated in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are ancient retroviruses that infected human germ line cells and became permanently integrated into the genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. HERV genes are usually silenced but can become activated in response to viral infections. As an example, the HERV-K18 env gene can be activated in B cells by EBV and HHV-6. However, no differences in HERV-K18 env transcript levels, HHV-6 virus copy number, or HHV-7 virus copy number were observed among patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> compared with healthy individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70034242\"><span class=\"h3\">XMRV and MLV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA from the retrovirus XMRV and related retroviruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), was detected in the blood of some patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> in two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. However, XMRV was <strong>not</strong> detected in the blood of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> in several other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>], including studies that used the same blood samples as the earlier studies in which XMRV was detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], or blood drawn from the same individuals who previously had positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. One of the original studies that reported the detection of XMRV in the blood of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] was later partially retracted by the authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and subsequently fully retracted by the editor of the journal in which it was published due to concerns about the validity of the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Soon after this full retraction occurred, the authors of the other original study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] retracted their results as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The most comprehensive investigation was a multi-laboratory study in which blood was collected from 147 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and 146 healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Samples were sent in a blinded fashion to three laboratories, including the two laboratories that initially reported detecting DNA from XMRV or MLV in the blood of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and one of the laboratories that reported failure to replicate these findings. DNA from XMRV or MLV were not detected from the plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of any of the patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> or from any of the healthy patients.</p><p>Importantly, multiple studies have demonstrated that contamination of patient samples (with mouse genomic DNA), laboratory reagents (with MLV-encoding nucleic acids), and human tumor cell lines (with XMRV or related viruses) can lead to the detection of these retroviruses, suggesting that the earlier findings that showed an association between <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and XMRV or MLV were caused by contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/40,45-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45-50</a>]. One study demonstrated that XMRV was generated by the recombination of two proviruses during passaging of a human prostate cancer xenograft in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis of MLV sequences from samples that were collected longitudinally from <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> patients suggested that the MLV sequences were consistent with contamination rather than viral evolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> may be associated with mild immune dysregulation of uncertain pathogenetic importance. True immune deficiency is <strong>not</strong> a feature of this syndrome. Some studies have detected immune differences in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> relative to healthy control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/52-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-57</a>]. However, it is important to note that the abnormalities have been diverse, modest, and in some cases conflicting.</p><p>Findings reported in these studies include lower than normal levels of circulating immune complexes, reduced numbers of natural killer (NK) cells, depressed NK cell function, altered levels of immunoglobulins, increased titers of antiviral antibodies (directed against measles, HHV-6, EBV, and cytomegalovirus), lower levels of autoantibodies, increased cell surface adhesion molecules, enhanced interferon activity, increased levels of interleukin-2, altered <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> ratios, reduced CD8 suppressor cell population, increased activation markers on CD8 cells, and increased levels of cytokines that correlated with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> symptom severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/52-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-57</a>].</p><p>Other case-control studies have found no differences in white blood cell counts, immune complexes, complement, immunoglobulins, delayed hypersensitivity, allergic responses, NK cell function, cytokine levels, proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens, or transcriptionally mediated immune cell dysregulation in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine-metabolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several metabolic abnormalities have been described in <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> but their causal role is unclear. Low serum cortisol levels have been found in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> who met the CDC criteria; other data suggested chronic undersecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, perhaps as a reflection of an underlying neuroendocrine disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. There is also evidence suggesting that patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> have increased serotoninergic activity in the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] and enhanced serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>However, some of these changes are not specific for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> since similar neuroendocrine abnormalities are seen in patients with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], other syndromes with atypical depressive features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], and after an alteration in sleep pattern in otherwise healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

A study in 21 pairs of monozygotic twins, in which one of the set had <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and one did not, found abnormal tilt tests in 19 percent of those with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and 19 percent of those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In addition, a preliminary blinded study of 20 individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> who had not undergone tilt table testing found that low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> (0.1 to 0.2 mg) did not provide any benefit compared with placebo after six weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The infective symptoms predicted fatigue initially but not six months later, suggesting that <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> may be more related to premorbid characteristics of the patient and clinician behavior than to features of a precipitating viral illness.</p><p>Even if depression is not the underlying cause but rather a consequence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> it should be aggressively treated so that the patient can better manage <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22448877\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep disruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep disruption has been proposed as a possible cause of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>.

Much of this is due to the lack of objective findings. Nonetheless, patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> have real symptoms and are not malingerers. The prevalence of this syndrome is unclear in part due to difficulties in proving the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is primarily a disorder of young to middle-aged adults. It is about twice as common in women than in men. Few cases have been reported in minorities or among lower socioeconomic groups. However, the incidence in these groups may be underestimated due to their lack of equivalent access to health care institutions in which <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is studied. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proposed etiologies for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> include the following (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Proposed etiologies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection &ndash; There has been intense interest in whether certain viruses could be responsible for causing <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), and others.
