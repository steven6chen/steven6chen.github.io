The clinical manifestations of microsporidiosis are diverse and include intestinal, pulmonary, ocular, muscular, and renal disease. Microsporidiosis has been identified in immunosuppressed hosts (eg, transplant and HIV-infected patients), travelers, children, and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 150 genera and more than 1300 species of microsporidia have been described, which are classified based on spore size, arrangement of the nucleus, mode of replication within the host cell, and rRNA analysis. Microsporidia are considered protozoa, although comparative molecular phylogenetic studies support a relationship between the microsporidia and fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fourteen different species have been reported to infect humans, many of which were discovered as opportunistic infections in association with the AIDS epidemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70473\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70473 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The spores vary in size; those that infect humans are typically oval and 1 to 2 microns in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78496 \">figure 1</a>). The spores are highly resistant to degradation and can survive in the environment for up to four months. Their structure is distinguished by the presence of a polar filament, which facilitates injection of the spore contents into the host cell.</p><p>The most common species causing infection in humans is <em>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</em>, followed by the <em>Encephalitozoon</em> species, particularly <em>Encephalitozoon intestinalis</em>. <em>E. bieneusi</em> consists of multiple genotypes; 26 different genotypes have been found in humans only and 8 genotypes reported in both humans<sup> </sup>and animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among <em>E. intestinalis</em> isolates, there have been no molecular differences observed among those originating from infected humans and infected animals, which may imply there is no transmission barrier between different<sup> </sup>host species. Other <em>Encephalitozoon</em> species causing human infection are <em>E. cuniculi</em> and <em>E. hellem</em>. Antigenic diversity has also been demonstrated among these isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p><em>E. bieneusi</em> and <em>Encephalitozoon</em> species usually infect the gastrointestinal and biliary tracts, although there have been a few case reports of isolation of <em>E. bieneusi</em> from the respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <em>Enterocytozoon</em> infections normally cause localized infection; in contrast, <em>Encephalitozoon</em> species have the ability to disseminate widely via macrophages, thus causing systemic infection involving the intestinal and hepatobiliary tracts, respiratory tract, sinuses, kidney, eye, and brain.</p><p>Several other species are capable of causing disseminated disease, including <em>Trachipleistophora</em> species (<em>T. hominis</em> and <em>T. anthropopthera</em>), <em>Pleistophora </em>species (<em>P. ronneafiei</em> and others), and <em>Anncaliia </em>species, also known as <em>Brachiola</em> species (<em>A. vesicularum</em> and <em>A. algerae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <em>Nosema</em> spp and <em>Vittaforma cornea</em> most commonly cause ocular infections. Myositis associated with <em>Pleistophora</em> spp, <em>Trachipleistophora</em> spp, and <em>Anncaliia algerae</em> has been described in individual reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of microsporidiosis is poorly understood. The minimal number of microsporidia required to cause human disease is unknown, and no toxins have been described. It is possible that a &quot;carrier state&quot; exists and that reactivation occurs with immunosuppression, although this has not been definitively documented.</p><p>Intestinal disease is characterized by distortion of the villus architecture, particularly within the small intestine, without a significant inflammatory response. Progressive morphological and functional abnormalities of the small intestine appear to occur as the number of organisms increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Infection may interfere with intestinal absorption and secretion. In one study of 21 patients with chronic diarrhea or wasting secondary to microsporidiosis, evidence of crypt hyperplasia and a decrease in villous absorptive surface area was demonstrated on jejunal biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microsporidia spores typically enter the host via ingestion or inhalation. Once within the intestinal or respiratory tract, the spores are propelled into the host cell by their polar filament, enabling the infective sporoplasm (nucleus) to be injected from the spore into the host cell. Once within the host epithelial cell, proliferation occurs via merogony (binary fission) or schizogony (multiple fission) to form multinucleate plasmodial forms. This is followed by a period of maturation via a process known as sporogony, which involves thickening and development of the spore membranes, further divisions, and finally formation of new mature spores. These spores ultimately burst out of the infected cell, and the released spores can infect nearby host cells or pass out into the environment. Thus, the spores can complete their life cycle within a single host (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78098\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78098 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microsporidia exist worldwide, although an accurate assessment of their prevalence in the general population has not been established. In one European study of 576 immunocompetent adults, a seroprevalence of 5 to 8 percent was observed; the prevalence of diarrhea was not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one review, the prevalence of microsporidiosis ranged from 1 to 42 percent in HIV-infected individuals and from 0 to 24 percent in HIV-uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Most symptomatic infections in humans occur among patients with HIV infection who are significantly immunocompromised (CD4 &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>. The prevalence of infection rises with increased levels of immunosuppression, ranging from 7 to 50 percent in reports of symptomatic patients with diarrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/14-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-22</a>]. In a study of 2652 HIV-infected patients with diarrhea in Peru, 3 percent were diagnosed with microsporidiosis; risk factors included contact with duck or chicken droppings and poor sanitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Patients with HIV infection may also be asymptomatic. In one study of 106 patients with HIV infection, 15 percent of patients had evidence of microsporidia on small bowel biopsy, regardless of intestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, much lower colonization rates have been observed in other reports of HIV patients without diarrhea (approximately 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25</a>].</p><p>Microsporidia infections have also been described in HIV-uninfected patients who are otherwise immunocompromised, such as organ transplant recipients and bone marrow graft recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>]. Among renal transplant recipients, it is a relatively late-occurring opportunistic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Older adult individuals may also be at risk for microsporidiosis; in one report of 47 older adult patients with diarrhea, intestinal microsporidiosis due to <em>E. bieneusi</em> was identified in 17 percent of cases by polymerase chain reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Infection can also occur in immunocompetent hosts, largely in the form of diarrheal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. <em>E. intestinalis</em> has been found in stool samples of travelers with chronic diarrhea, but a pathogenic role has not been definitively demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>It is unknown whether microsporidia infection routinely persists in a latent state or if reactivation occurs during conditions of immune compromise. It is also unknown if persistently infected individuals can transmit infection to others at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of microsporidiosis is not fully understood. Foodborne, waterborne, person-to-person, animal-to-person, vector-borne, and airborne transmission may all be possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/13,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,38-41</a>]. Microsporidia spores have been detected in urine, feces, and respiratory secretions.</p><p>Many animals shed <em>E. bieneusi</em> oocysts; it is uncertain whether household pets represent a source of human infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. <em>E. intestinalis</em> has been identified in humans and animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of microsporidiosis vary depending upon the infecting species and the host immune status.

Clinical manifestations include watery, nonbloody diarrhea, nausea, diffuse abdominal pain, and fever. Diarrhea tends to be self-limited in immunocompetent patients. The correlation between detection of microsporidia in stool and gastrointestinal symptoms may be transient; microsporidia infection may cause clinical symptoms during the early stages of infection that resolve even though evidence of microsporidia may persist on diagnostic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>In addition to diarrhea, other extraintestinal manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular infections with superficial punctate keratitis and stromal keratitis<sup> </sup>associated with eye pain have been reported in immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

Endoscopic biopsy is not more sensitive than stool examination because infection can be patchy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/62,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,79</a>]. The spores are typically oval and 1 to 2 mcm in diameter.</p><p>The laboratory should be alerted to the potential diagnosis, and specific stains for microsporidia should be requested since routine examination for ova and parasites does not usually detect microsporidia spores. Fecal leukocytes and blood are usually absent since microsporidia infection is not associated with a significant inflammation. When present, these findings should raise suspicion for coinfection with another organism.</p><p>Light microscopy with a modified trichrome stain is often used for microscopy. This technique stains microsporidia spores pink against a blue-green background; it can be used on stool, urine, mucus, or tissue specimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78496 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].

These stains have a number of advantages compared with other methods because they can be performed rapidly, are equally effective on unfixed or formalin-fixed specimens, and can detect spores in stool, intestinal fluid, biopsy imprints, and paraffin biopsy sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. However, species identification is not possible.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also used for microscopic detection of microsporidia and traditionally has been the primary method for species identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Alternatively, classification can be based on molecular sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the simultaneous detection and species identification of microsporidial infections have been developed although, in general, are performed only in specialized laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/39,93-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,93-99</a>].

None of these agents has consistently or effectively eradicated the infection; further study is needed.</p><p>Along with specific therapy for microsporidiosis, treatment of immune suppression is critically important in patients with HIV infection, since restoration of immunity has been associated with clinical and microbiological cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-113</a>]. Clearance of microsporidial infections has even been reported with antiretroviral therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115</a>]. Dietary supplementation is also helpful, particularly in patients who have had weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>For treatment of <em>E. bieneusi</em> infection, systemic fumagillin (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally in three divided doses for 14 days) has been tried with some success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/117-119\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-119</a>]. In one small dose-response study of fumagillin in HIV-infected patients with <em>E. bieneusi</em> infection, the highest dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> was associated with clearance of the organism in 72 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. The majority of patients in the lower-dose groups had transient clearance from stools but all relapsed within one year. Fumagillin may also be active in other immunosuppressed hosts. A randomized, double-blind study in 12 patients (10 with HIV and 2 post-transplantation) documented clearance of the organism in all patients who received fumagillin and in none of patients receiving placebo; the six placebo recipients subsequently cleared the organism with open-label fumagillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. In a report of 10 cases of <em>E. bieneusi</em> in renal transplant patients who were treated with fumagillin, all patients responded well clinically and all cleared the microsporidial spores from their stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Fumagillin was effective in a pediatric liver-kidney transplant patient with intestinal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p>Fumagillin can cause dose-related bone marrow toxicity. In addition, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and hyperlipasemia have been noted with the use of fumagillin. These adverse effects have limited the clinical use of the drug, and it is not available for systemic use in the United States. A less toxic analogue of fumagillin is under evaluation, as are combination therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/113,121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,121-123</a>].</p><p>Other agents being studied in vivo against microsporidia include polyamines and fluoroquinolones, but clinical data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Limited data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitazoxanide</a> (1 g twice daily) for 60 days may also be effective for the treatment of <em>E. bieneusi</em> infections in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20620126\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular infections due to microsporidia should be treated with topical Fumidil B (fumagillin bicyclohexylammonium) in saline (to achieve a concentration of 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of fumagillin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/108,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,126</a>]. In HIV-infected patients, lesions due to <em>E. hellem</em> may respond to this regimen, although lesions due to <em>V. corneae</em> generally respond poorly to topical therapy and keratoplasty may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microsporidiosis/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>]. The concomitant use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> is often warranted, particularly in patients with ocular infections who have evidence of systemic involvement.

Fourteen different species have been reported in humans, many of which were discovered as opportunistic infections in association with the AIDS epidemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70473\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70473 \">table 1</a>). The most common species causing infection in humans is <em>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</em>, followed by the <em>Encephalitozoon</em> species, particularly <em>Encephalitozoon intestinalis</em>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission of microsporidiosis is not fully understood. Microsporidia spores typically enter the host via ingestion or inhalation. Most symptomatic infections in humans occur among patients with HIV infection who are significantly immunocompromised (CD4 &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> or other immunocompromised individuals (such as organ transplant recipients). Microsporidiosis can also occur in immunocompetent individuals. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations include watery, nonbloody diarrhea, nausea, diffuse abdominal pain, and fever. Among immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals, other manifestations include ocular infection, cerebral infection, and myositis. In addition, a variety of other manifestations can occur in the setting of HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of microsporidiosis consists of microscopic detection of the spores in stool, body fluids, or tissue specimens. Light microscopy with a modified trichrome stain demonstrates pink microsporidia spores against a blue-green background (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78496 \">figure 1</a>). The laboratory should be alerted to the potential diagnosis, and specific stains for microsporidia should be requested since routine examination for ova and parasites does not usually detect microsporidia spores. Other assays have also been described. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> (400 mg orally twice daily for two to four weeks) for treatment of intestinal microsporidiosis due to <em>E. intestinalis</em> and for treatment of disseminated microsporidiosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54051\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54051 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The optimal approach for treatment of intestinal infection due to <em>E. bieneusi</em> or for treatment of ocular infection is uncertain; fumagillin may be effective though further study is needed. Reversal of immune suppression whenever possible is also important.
