Fever, exercise, heart failure, and poor glycemic control are among the factors that can cause transient increases in albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Moderately increased albuminuria is unlikely if the albumin excretion rate is below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span> in a timed collection or the urine albumin concentration is less than 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> in a random specimen. Higher values (particularly those just above this range) may represent false positive results, and should be confirmed by repeated measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>There are also a variety of semiquantitative dipsticks, such as Clinitek Microalbumin Dipsticks and Micral-Test II test strips, which can be used to test for moderately increased albuminuria if urine albumin excretion cannot be directly measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The reported sensitivity and specificity of these tests range from 80 to 97 percent and 33 to 80 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>One problem with measuring the urine albumin concentration or estimating it with a sensitive dipstick is that false negative and false positive results can occur, since the urine albumin concentration is determined by the urine volume and the amount of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, at a particular rate of albumin excretion, a substantial increase or decrease in urine volume will respectively lower and raise the urine albumin concentration. The confounding effect of the urine volume can be minimized by repeated measurements on early morning specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The confounding effect of variations in urine volume on the urine albumin concentration can be avoided by calculation of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urine specimen. A value of 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> of creatinine (or, using standard [SI] units, 3.4 to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> of creatinine) suggests that albumin excretion is between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and, therefore, that moderately increased albuminuria is probably present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Values above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (or 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol)</span> are indicative of severely increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;). This classification system requires that at least two of three specimens obtained over a three- to six-month period fall within the moderately or severely increased range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p>In one report, 24-hour urine collections and random, single-void urine specimens for albumin and creatinine were obtained in 14 normal subjects, 13 with type 1 diabetes, and 12 with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A close correlation was noted between the two measurements and the within-patient variability was very small. A random albumin-to-creatinine ratio above 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> had a sensitivity of 100 percent for the detection of moderately increased albuminuria. Similar findings have been noted by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three important caveats that must be considered to maximize the reliability of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.</p><p>The optimal time to measure the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is uncertain. The best data come from reports that primarily evaluated patients without diabetes. In a 1983 study, the best correlation with a 24-hour urine collection occurred with samples obtained after the first morning void and before bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, a later and larger study found the best correlation with the first morning void, although the difference compared with spot urine samples at other times was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Given the uncertainty, we have a slight preference for first morning void specimens. If this is inconvenient, specimens can be obtained at other times during the day. There are no data about the timing of repeat measurements as the patient's course is being monitored. If possible, it seems preferable to obtain the samples at approximately the same time of day.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vigorous exercise can cause a transient increase in albumin excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As a result, patients should refrain from vigorous exercise in the 24 hours prior to the test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accuracy of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio will be diminished if creatinine excretion is substantially different from the expected value; this is particularly important in patients with borderline values. Albumin excretion will be underestimated in a muscular man with a high rate of creatinine excretion and overestimated in a cachectic patient in whom muscle mass and creatinine excretion are markedly reduced. The ratio also varies with <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> in the United States, as creatinine excretion is significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urinary sample is the preferred screening strategy for moderately increased albuminuria in all diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9,10</a>]. This test has the following advantages: it gives a quantitative result that correlates with the 24-hour urine values over a wide range of protein excretion, it is simple to perform and inexpensive, and repeat values can be easily obtained to ascertain that moderately increased albuminuria, if present, is persistent.

These defects become more prominent with progression to overt proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, changes in charge selectivity may not be an important factor in the genesis of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Another possible mechanism of albuminuria, at least in type 1 diabetes mellitus, is decreased degradation of filtered albumin within the tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] or impaired tubular uptake of filtered albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following data might be considered to represent the &quot;natural history&quot; of moderately increased albuminuria (formerly, microalbuminuria) in patients with type 1 diabetes, since they were mostly obtained before the current era of recommended strict glycemic control, aggressive blood pressure control, and therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Long-term follow-up of patients with type 1 diabetes who have moderately increased albuminuria has shown that the likelihood of progression to overt nephropathy (defined as a positive urine dipstick for protein, also called severely increased albuminuria [formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;] or overt or clinical proteinuria) varies with the duration of diabetes and other risk factors. On the other hand, there is also an appreciable rate of spontaneous regression of moderately increased albuminuria to normoalbuminuria. These issues are discussed in the following sections.</p><p>Renal biopsy findings in patients with type 1 diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria can range from relatively normal histology (most often seen in patients excreting less than 45 mg of albumin per day) to clear evidence of diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The mean duration of diabetes was 6.7 years in the Prevention arm and 11 years in the Protection against progression arm.</p><p>At a mean follow-up of approximately 4.7 years, there was no difference between the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a> and placebo groups in either the rate of developing moderately increased albuminuria (6 versus 5 percent and 16 versus 16 percent [hazard ratio, abbreviated as HR, 1.08 and 1.03] in the prevention and progression arms, respectively) or in the annual rate of increase in urinary albumin excretion.</p><p>Lack of prevention of moderately increased albuminuria was also noted in the RASS, which included 285 normotensive normoalbuminuric patients with type 1 diabetes (mean duration 11 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Severely increased albuminuria (formerly, macroalbuminuria) refers to albumin excretion above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately increased albuminuria generally develops 5 to 15 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes. The reported prevalence is approximately 30 percent at 15 years and 50 percent by 30 years. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors associated with the development of moderately increased albuminuria include increased albumin excretion at baseline, poor glycemic control, hypertension, presence and severity of retinopathy, and elevated total or LDL-cholesterol. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately increased albuminuria regresses to normoalbuminuria in a significant proportion of patients. Risk factors that favor the regression of moderately increased albuminuria include better glycemic control, lower blood pressure, lower serum cholesterol and triglycerides, recent onset and lower levels of albuminuria, and less glomerular hyperfiltration. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Regression to normoalbuminuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately increased albuminuria is associated with a higher risk for developing severely increased albuminuria, retinopathy, neuropathy, and for overall mortality. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred screening strategy for moderately increased albuminuria is measurement of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urinary sample. A value of 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> of creatinine (or, using standard [SI] units, 3.4 to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> of creatinine) suggests that albumin excretion is between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and therefore that moderately increased albuminuria is probably present. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that the albumin-to-creatinine ratio be measured yearly in all patients who have had type 1 diabetes for five years or more. An elevated ratio should be confirmed with at least two additional tests performed over the subsequent three to six months, with confirmation of the diagnosis requiring at least two of three positive samples. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among hypertensive patients with persistent moderately increased albuminuria, we recommend treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor rather than other antihypertensive agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The renal goal of ACE inhibitor therapy is to reduce blood pressure and slow nephropathy progression among those with established diabetic nephropathy. Other drugs are added as necessary to attain the goal blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin inhibition'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence supporting angiotensin inhibition for the primary prevention of moderately increased albuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes who are normoalbuminuric and normotensive. Such patients should be screened yearly for moderately increased albuminuria and an ACE inhibitor initiated if persistent moderately increased albuminuria is documented. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'ACE inhibitors or ARBs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Issues related to glycemic control, which is essential to minimize both the renal and extrarenal complications of type 1 diabetes, are discussed in detail elsewhere.
