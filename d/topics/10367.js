This topic will discuss potential interventions to reduce this risk in patients at relatively high baseline risk.

The timing of elective noncardiac surgery will be determined in large part by consideration of the risk of the premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (in order for the surgery to occur), and the consequences of delaying surgery (eg, poor quality of life or concern about the progression of a cancer). These issues are discussed separately.

In most cases, additional cardiovascular testing will not be performed, but suggestions about monitoring and medication management may be made.</p><p>Rarely, a patient may have an acute coronary syndrome or decompensated heart failure and a need for urgent or emergent surgery. In these difficult clinical situations, careful consideration of the benefits and risks of differing strategies is necessary. There is no single approach that can be applied in this situation. For these patients, we feel strongly that consultation with a cardiologist should be obtained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of perioperative cardiac complications should be assessed in all patients. Risk assessment is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REVASCULARIZATION BEFORE SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exception of patients with an acute coronary syndrome, we do not recommend myocardial revascularization prior to noncardiac surgery to improve perioperative outcomes of noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, some patients, such as those with significant left main coronary artery disease, will need revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention to improve long-term survival or, on occasion, to improve the quality of their life. The timing of revascularization relative to the planned noncardiac surgery should be determined by the relative benefits and risks consequent to choosing one procedure to be performed before the other. The decision on timing should be discussed with the patient.</p><p>The potential downside of performing coronary artery revascularization prior to noncardiac surgery depends on the form of revascularization. Many patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) need or want to recover from this procedure for two to three months before undergoing elective noncardiac surgery.&nbsp;Some surgeries can be performed as early as four weeks after CABG as long as the sternum has healed such that it can tolerate any stress associated with the noncardiac surgery and recovery. </p><p>For patients undergoing coronary artery stenting, elective noncardiac surgery will need to be deferred until after the minimal recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for each type of stent in order to minimize adverse cardiovascular events. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H350963316\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiac surgery after percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.).</p><p>If delaying noncardiac surgery is an option for patients who need coronary artery revascularization to prolong long-term survival, we believe it is reasonable to proceed with diagnostic angiography in patients with high-risk features on noninvasive testing (eg, reversible large anterior wall defect, multiple reversible defects, ischemia occurring at a low heart rate, extensive stress-induced wall motion abnormalities, and transient ischemic dilatation). However, the available evidence is not robust and suggests that most patients with stable coronary artery disease do not benefit from prophylactic revascularization prior to noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p>The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis trial was a randomized comparison of planned preoperative revascularization (with either percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or CABG) and no plan for preoperative coronary revascularization in patients with stable coronary disease undergoing major vascular surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Both groups received usual medical therapy with approximately 80 percent of both groups receiving beta blockers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and over 50 percent receiving statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Of 5859 patients scheduled for vascular operations, 1190 were considered to be at increased cardiac risk (based upon clinical factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stress testing) and had no other exclusions to participation (urgent vascular surgery or severe coexisting illness). These patients underwent coronary angiography; an additional 680 patients were excluded because of left main coronary disease, severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &le;20 percent), severe aortic stenosis, or coronary anatomy not suitable for revascularization. The remaining 510 patients (representing 9 percent of the original study candidates) were randomly assigned to planned preoperative revascularization or no plan for preoperative coronary revascularization. One-third of the study subjects had three-vessel coronary disease. Of those assigned to revascularization, 38 percent underwent CABG, 55 percent underwent PCI, and 7 percent received no revascularization. Of note, 5.8 percent of the patients in the revascularization group had a myocardial infarction (MI) and 1.7 percent died prior to their elective vascular surgery. The following outcomes were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MI within the first 30 days after noncardiac surgery in patients assigned to revascularization or no revascularization was 8.4 percent in both groups. However, 5.8 percent of the patients in the coronary revascularization group experienced an MI after their coronary revascularization but prior to their noncardiac surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no differences between the revascularization and medical arms in LVEF at three months (54 versus 55 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a median of 2.7 years, the primary end point (all-cause mortality) was not significantly different in the revascularization and no revascularization groups (22 versus 23 percent, relative risk 0.98, 95% CI 0.70-1.37).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-hoc subgroup analysis found that only patients with unprotected left main coronary artery disease benefited from preoperative revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Observational studies have found comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or improved outcomes with revascularization prior to noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. </p><p>The discussion of the approach to patients in whom a decision is made for PCI prior to noncardiac surgery is found elsewhere.

While there is some evidence to start therapy to lower the risk of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI), we do not start beta blockers preoperatively in patients without strong indications, as they may increase the risk of death and stroke. (See <a href=\"#H85539203\" class=\"local\">'Patients without indications for long-term therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>We continue beta blockers in patients taking them for indications such as hypertension, rate control for atrial fibrillation, control of angina, heart failure, or prior MI. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Patients taking beta blockers'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients scheduled for noncardiac surgery who should have been started on beta blocker for an appropriate indication (eg, heart failure, angina, hypertension, after MI), we try to avoid starting a beta blocker preoperatively, particularly if the time between initiation and surgery is less than two to four hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85539203\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients without indications for long-term therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not start preoperative beta blocker to improve perioperative outcomes. Some support for the use of beta blockers prior to noncardiac surgery arose from initial randomized trials, which suggested that beta blockers reduce perioperative ischemia, long-term mortality, and cardiovascular complications in patients with underlying arterial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. </p><p>The largest trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic beta blockers, POISE, randomly assigned 8351 patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic disease (most with a revised cardiac risk index [RCRI] of 1 or 2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075 \">table 1</a>) undergoing noncardiac surgery (42 percent vascular surgery) to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> (100 mg controlled release [CR] metoprolol succinate) or placebo started two to four hours before surgery and repeated 0 to 6 hours after surgery depending on the patients hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This was followed by 200 mg of metoprolol or placebo daily for 30 days. Study drug administration was given if the heart rate was &ge;50 beats per minute and the systolic blood pressure was &ge;100 mmHg. If patients did not fulfill these criteria but later did, their dose of metoprolol CR decreased to 100 mg daily. &#160;</p><p>The following findings were noted at 30 days:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal cardiac arrest occurred significantly less often in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> group (5.8 versus 6.9 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-0.99). This benefit was driven entirely by a reduction in MI (4.2 versus 5.7 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total mortality and stroke were significantly increased in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> group (3.1 versus 2.3 percent and 1 versus 0.5 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>Clinically important hypotension occurred significantly more often in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> group (15 versus 9.7 percent). A post-hoc analysis suggested that hypotension accounted for at least one-third of the deaths and 15 percent of the strokes. The higher frequency of hypotension in the metoprolol group raises the possibility that either the schedule (two to four hours before surgery) or dose (100 mg of long acting metoprolol) of beta blocker was not optimal. The POISE trial emphasizes the importance of avoiding hypotension if beta blockers are used. It is not known whether a lower dose or earlier initiation (eg, 30 days before surgery) would reduce the frequency of hypotension while maintaining adequate effects to produce benefit (a lower risk of MI). </p><p>In an attempt to put the finding of an increased stroke risk into perspective, the POISE investigators performed a meta-analysis of six trials (including POISE, DIPOM, and MaVS, which measured nonfatal stroke as an end point). The use of perioperative beta blockade was associated with a significantly increased risk of nonfatal stroke (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.26-3.78). While POISE accounted for almost 80 percent of the patients in the meta-analysis, the relative risk of nonfatal stroke in the five trials before POISE was also higher but was not statistically significant (HR 2.98, 95% CI 0.74-12.0). Multiple other meta-analyses have confirmed an increase in mortality and stroke in studies where beta blocker therapy was initiated within 24 hours of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. For example, a 2014 meta-analysis identified 16 randomized trials and one cohort study (including 12,043 patients) in which a beta blocker was started within 24 hours of surgery. Excluding the DECREASE trials, which have been discredited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/18,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23-26</a>], there was a 30 percent increase in the 30-day risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.63) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>]. Although beta blockers lowered the risk of non-fatal MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.86), they increased the risk of non-fatal stroke (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.09-3.66). </p><p>Most of the patients enrolled in POISE, as discussed above, had an RCRI of 1 or 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075 \">table 1</a>). Some experts have suggested that beta blocker therapy might be of value in patients with an RCRI &ge;3. Evidence suggesting that beta blockers are of benefit in these higher-risk patients comes from three observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, information about dosing and timing of initiation of therapy are limited in these observational studies. While these three observational studies of higher-risk patients suggest potential benefit from beta blockers, we are concerned about the potential for bias in patient selection. Thus, until better evidence is available, we suggest not starting beta blockers in patients without long-term indications for such therapy simply because they are at high risk as calculated by an RCRI score of three or more (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H476805796\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who may require preoperative initiation of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, preoperative evaluation of patients scheduled for noncardiac surgery identifies individuals who should have been receiving long-term beta blocker therapy for indications such as systolic heart failure, prior MI, or stable angina pectoris. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers'</a>.) </p><p>Patients who are started on beta blocker therapy more than two to four weeks before surgery should be followed using normal standards of care for beta blocker initiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the management of stable ischemic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic goals'</a>.) </p><p>For patients who are identified as needing long-term beta blocker therapy within two to four weeks of surgery, we are uncertain of the optimal approach. We balance the potential benefits of initiation prior to surgery with the possible increase in risk of all-cause death or stroke. (See <a href=\"#H85539203\" class=\"local\">'Patients without indications for long-term therapy'</a> above.) Care is individualized. If a decision is made to start beta blocker within 30 days of noncardiac surgery, the impact of the drug (ie, blood pressure, heart rate, symptoms) should be monitored closely with follow-up visits and titration should be done cautiously. If the indication for the initiation of beta blocker is either hypertension or slowing of the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation, it may be prudent to not aim for optimal blood pressure control or rate control, respectively, preoperatively.</p><p>However, for many of these patients, we wait until after surgery to start beta blockade, as the potential benefit (eg, survival in patients with heart failure) is small over a short period of time whereas the risk of perioperative stroke or death is increased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients taking beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest continuing beta blocker therapy in most patients taking them long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. While we are concerned about the potential for an increase in adverse events attributable to the presence of beta blocker effect in the perioperative period (see <a href=\"#H85539203\" class=\"local\">'Patients without indications for long-term therapy'</a> above), there is no evidence that discontinuing them is beneficial. </p><p>In addition, we do not recommend switching to another, as the evidence that one agent is significantly better than another has significant limitations. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> below.) </p><p>Evidence for a possible increase in adverse events such as stroke and all-cause mortality comes from the POISE trial (see <a href=\"#H85539203\" class=\"local\">'Patients without indications for long-term therapy'</a> above) and from observational studies. In a 2015 study of 14,644 hypertensive patients who received beta blockers and 40,676 who received other antihypertensive therapy, the primary end point of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal MI) at 30 days occurred in 1.3 percent of the former and 0.8 percent of the latter (adjusted odds ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A similar increase in mortality was seen.</p><p>Regarding perioperative dosing, lowering the dose may decrease the risk of perioperative hypotension. In POISE, 9.7 percent of the patients in the placebo group developed clinically significant hypotension. Therefore, a titrated beta blocker dose that appears effective preoperatively is unlikely to inform what dose of a beta blocker is safe after surgery when clinically significant hypotension is common. Physicians may want to give consideration to lowering dosing during the first 48 hours after surgery. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As there is no evidence that outcomes are better with one beta blocker compared with others, we do not switch beta blockers in advance of surgery. All studies that have reported a cardiovascular benefit of perioperative beta blockers have used agents that are moderately (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>) or highly (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisoprolol</a>) beta-1 cardioselective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As there is a paucity of high-quality evidence to suggest that one beta-1 cardioselective agent has a better efficacy to safety ratio, we do not have a preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. There is, however, evidence from observational studies suggesting that metoprolol, which is the least selective of the three beta blockers in the perioperative randomized controlled trials, was associated with a higher incidence of stroke and cardiovascular morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/29,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33-36</a>]. </p><p>For patients who cannot take beta blockers orally in the perioperative period, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Baseline heart rate and blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the risks of hypotension and stroke in the perioperative period found in the large POISE trial discussed above (see <a href=\"#H85539203\" class=\"local\">'Patients without indications for long-term therapy'</a> above), we believe that close attention should be paid to the preoperative heart rate and blood pressure. The optimal preoperative heart rate and blood pressure for any patient receiving long-term beta blocker therapy is not known. We suggest that the resting heart rate be between 60 and 70 beats per minute. Some of our experts hold the dose on the morning of surgery if the systolic blood pressure is &lt;115 mmHg and half the dose if it is between 116 and 130 mmHg. With regard to heart rate, excessive bradycardia should be avoided. Bradycardia severe enough to require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> has been reported in over 20 percent of patients receiving perioperative beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. Similarly, resting tachycardia may indicate inadequate beta blocker effect and should be also avoided. Patients with heart rates higher than 60 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> are at increased risk of death or MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. We believe that a resting heart rate between 60 and 70 beats per minute is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/17,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,40</a>]. Some of our experts evaluate preoperative heart rate with an outpatient Holter monitor to evaluate beta blocker effect during different daily situations. Others evaluate the heart rate response to stress in some patients to be certain that they can achieve a stress-induced minimum of 100 beats per minute. </p><p>In POISE and other studies, the use of beta blockers has been associated with perioperative hypotension, which may occur in up to 15 percent of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H85539203\" class=\"local\">'Patients without indications for long-term therapy'</a> above.) However, as POISE did not enroll patients on long-term beta blockers, observations about blood pressure in POISE may not be directly applicable to patients on long-term therapy. The mechanism by which beta blockers are associated with an increase in the rate of stroke and death in the studies cited above is not known but may be related to the increased rate of hypotension seen in these patients. Additionally, the reduction in cerebral blood flow may be more pronounced in patients taking less selective beta blockers, particularly in the setting of anemia (see below). </p><p>Until an adequately powered trial is undertaken to directly inform this issue, physicians will have to individualize the perioperative management of each patient who is chronically on a beta blocker. Reduction of the dose of beta blocker should be considered in the patient with systolic blood pressure &lt;115 mmHg.

For most of these patients taking aspirin monotherapy, we recommend that they hold such therapy five to seven days before surgery and that aspirin not be started before noncardiac surgery in those not taking aspirin. Patients with an indication for long-term aspirin usage who have their aspirin held prior to surgery should have their aspirin re-started when the perioperative risk of major bleeding has passed. However, we continue aspirin in patients with prior PCI and those undergoing carotid endarterectomy, unless the risk of major bleeding is thought to be high. The results are strongly influenced by the results of the POISE-2 trial (and one post hoc substudy from that trial) discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to the use of dual antiplatelet<strong> </strong>after percutaneous coronary intervention<strong> </strong>is discussed separately.

POISE-2 was a two-by-two factorial design trial that allowed for separate comparisons of aspirin to placebo and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> to placebo in 10,010 patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic disease who were undergoing noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H147659083\" class=\"local\">'Clonidine'</a> below.) Patients scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy, retinal surgery, or intracranial surgery were excluded. Patients were enrolled in one of two aspirin strata: the Starting Stratum (n = 5628) enrolled patients who were not taking aspirin chronically and the Continuation Stratum (n = 4382) enrolled patients who were taking aspirin chronically. Patients started <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirin/placebo</span> (200 mg) just before surgery and continued it daily (100 mg) for 30 days in the Starting Stratum and for seven days in the Continuation Stratum (after which patients resumed their regular aspirin). The primary outcome of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) at 30 days was similar in both groups (7 versus 7.1 percent, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.86-1.15). This finding was similar between those who were taking long-term aspirin and those who were not. As expected, major bleeding was more common in the aspirin group (4.6 versus 3.8 percent; HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.49). </p><p>In contrast to the overall group, a small subgroup (n = 470) analysis found that&nbsp;perioperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> may be more likely to benefit patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].&nbsp;This substudy excluded patients who were within one year of drug-eluting stent or six weeks within bare metal stent placement, as these patients required dual antiplatelet therapy. In patients who had PCI more than one year before noncardiac surgery, aspirin reduced the risk for the primary outcome (absolute risk reduction, 5.5% [95% CI 0.4-10.5]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.50, CI 0.26-0.95; P for interaction = 0.036) and for myocardial infarction (absolute risk reduction, 5.9% [CI 1.0-10.8]; HR 0.44, CI 0.22-0.87; P for interaction =0.021). The effect on the composite of major and life-threatening bleeding in patients with prior PCI was uncertain (absolute risk increase 1.3 percent [CI &minus;2.6 to 5.2]). While we are cautious about interpreting the findings in this post-hoc analysis of a small subgroup, we believe the results are plausible.</p><p>POISE-2 included about 600 patients undergoing vascular surgery.

In POISE-2 (see <a href=\"#H147659010\" class=\"local\">'Antiplatelet therapy'</a> above), clonidine did not reduce the rate of death or MI at 30 days (HR with clonidine 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.26). Clonidine did, however, increase the risk of clinically important hypotension and nonfatal cardiac arrest.
