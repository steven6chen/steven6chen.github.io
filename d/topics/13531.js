As a result, it is imperative that the choice of therapy be diagnostically driven as well as developmentally appropriate.</p><p>The vast majority of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents are appropriately managed with behavioral therapy alone, and behavioral interventions should be considered first-line therapy, as has been recommended for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in a limited number of clinical situations, pharmacologic intervention may be appropriate for management of the child or adolescent with significant difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, as long as a number of important caveats are taken into consideration.</p><p>In practice, a variety of nonprescription (over-the-counter) and prescription medications are used to treat pediatric insomnia by pediatric health care practitioners, or are initiated by a child's parents, often without medical guidance. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these medications in the pediatric population. Furthermore, no hypnotics or other medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of insomnia in children under the age of 16 years. Therefore, pharmacotherapy for insomnia in children is always an off-label use and should be approached with careful evaluation of the potential benefits, risks, and treatment options for the individual patient. </p><p>A general approach to making decisions about pharmacotherapy for sleep in children is outlined below, followed by a brief summary of the main considerations for individual medications. Related information is included in other UpToDate topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of sleep disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2609073293\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions about the use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia in children are informed by several considerations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efficacy &ndash; Little empirical evidence exists on effectiveness of these drugs in children. Only a few small clinical trials have been performed in children and most demonstrated no or little efficacy. Most of the information available regarding use of these medications in children is from case reports or small case series, or extrapolated from adult data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects &ndash; Potential short- and long-term side effects should be considered, including effects on sleep architecture and daytime drowsiness, as well as recurrence or even exacerbation (ie, rebound) of pretreatment insomnia symptoms following discontinuation of medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Safety &ndash; Unfortunately, the safety profile of sleep medications remain one of the most poorly researched areas in pediatric psychopharmacology. A specific concern is the risk of accidental overdose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethical considerations &ndash; When the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> profile of a medication is unclear, ethical concerns are particularly important. These include the possibility that medication will replace or detract from a safer or more effective behavioral intervention. This concern is sometimes characterized as &quot;medicating a parenting problem&quot; and giving the &quot;wrong message&quot; (ie, &quot;take a pill&quot;) to families about management of sleep issues.</p><p/><p>Despite these considerations, there is clearly a perceived need for safe and effective ways to improve sleep in children, as prescribing or recommending sedatives and hypnotics for sleep complaints is quite common among child health professionals, including pediatricians, family practitioners, and child psychiatrists in the United States, Canada, and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In particular, use of the synthetic hormone melatonin has risen dramatically during the past decade, likely because it is a nonprescription drug and is often perceived as &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; (see <a href=\"#H727571870\" class=\"local\">'Melatonin'</a> below). However, even the use of relatively &quot;benign&quot; medications such as melatonin may be counter-productive if this practice supplants the use of more effective and long-lasting behavioral treatments. Moreover, the long-term effects of melatonin administered in childhood remain poorly understood. Thus, decisions to initiate pharmacotherapy including melatonin should be undertaken thoughtfully, as outlined below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1133752404\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to initiate pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consideration of pharmacotherapy for sleep should include each of the following steps: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rigorous diagnostic assessment of the child's sleep problem</strong>. The diagnostic evaluation is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of sleep disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessment of behavioral contributors is particularly important, as these are common and are amenable to behavioral interventions. These may be the primary problem, or may exacerbate and perpetuate other sleep disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Screening for primary sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS), is critical because they would each warrant specific treatment; screening should include at minimum a focused history and examination. In addition, pharmacologic treatment of insomnia could potentially exacerbate coexisting sleep problems. For example, children with OSA are at risk for adverse effects from sedative medications that cause respiratory depression, or from other medications that may cause significant weight gain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation of the impact of the sleep disturbance</strong> on the child's health and daily functioning. In particular, possible neurobehavioral signs of daytime sleepiness (eg, mood changes, attention problems, impulsivity, poor school performance) must be carefully assessed. Children experiencing significant problems with daytime function are more likely to benefit from targeted intervention such as behavioral or pharmacotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychosocial evaluation of the family</strong>. This includes the impact of the sleep disturbance on other family members and consideration of other variables that might impact medication choice and adherence. Such variables may include educational level, parenting skills and style, household composition, parental stress level and caregiver exhaustion, and previous experience with and acceptability of pharmacologic treatment. For example, situations arise, albeit relatively rarely, in which families are so exhausted and overwhelmed by a child's sleep problems that concerns about both safety and parental mental health are warranted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychoeducation of the family</strong>. Important elements include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A simple explanation of the basics of sleep regulation. Points should include the role of the sleep drive, predictable 24-hour circadian patterns of relative alertness and sleepiness, and the multiple internal factors (such as hunger and boredom), and external factors (such as noise and light levels), that can facilitate or inhibit sleep. Understanding these factors can often help caregivers and patients to appreciate the complexity of the sleep-wake system and recognize the importance of behavioral strategies as a complement to medication. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Education about appropriate and healthy sleep practices. Topics should include environmental measures, such as avoiding stimulation from electronics, ensuring low light levels, and providing a comfortable room temperature; sleep-wake scheduling; sleep practices such as establishment of a bedtime routine; and awareness of relevant physiology, for example about caffeine use. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Behavioral intervention </strong>to treat or optimize any behavioral contributors to the sleep problem.<strong> </strong>This means that medication should not be the first or sole treatment strategy. The plan should be tailored to the individual characteristics of the patient and family. In most cases, behavioral interventions, including parenting strategies and attention to sleep hygiene, should be trialed before considering pharmacotherapy. In selected cases in which the sleep problem is causing significant child or family dysfunction, it may be appropriate to initiate pharmacotherapy at the same time as behavioral therapy. Behavioral efforts should continue during and after pharmacotherapy, as they are important for long-term success. Data from adult treatment trials demonstrate that behavioral interventions produce durable, long-term improvement, whereas the efficacy of medications typically wanes following discontinuation of treatment. It is likely that a similar pattern applies in the pediatric population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Make an individualized decision about appropriateness of pharmacotherapy</strong>, based on the above evaluation. Other key considerations include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Child's age &ndash; Pharmacotherapy is rarely appropriate for young children, except for unusual circumstances such as significant caregiver physical or mental health issues, or risk of child abuse. This is because behavioral causes and interventions are particularly common in this age group, and also because of the lack of safety and efficacy data in this age group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute versus chronic sleep problem &ndash; Children with underlying medical, psychiatric, or neurodevelopmental conditions, in comparison with otherwise healthy, typically developing children, are more likely to need longer-term pharmacotherapy to address sleep issues. For children with these comorbid conditions, it is particularly important to address behavioral issues and to select medications that are less likely to have long-term side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Set clear and realistic treatment goals</strong>, in collaboration with the family and patient, before embarking on pharmacotherapy. Include definable, realistic, agreed-upon, and measurable goals. As examples, goals might include sleep onset consistently less than 30 minutes, improvement in mood and attentiveness, or decrease in subjective distress for the caregiver or child about the insomnia. The most realistic immediate goal of treatment may be to improve rather than eliminate sleep problems. Defining goals helps to set realistic expectations and avoid frustration. In addition, the goals can serve as milestones at which termination of medication should be considered. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95607144\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of medication and dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the clinician and family have decided to initiate a trial of pharmacotherapy, the following should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selection of the medication</strong> &ndash; This choice should be based on the clinician's judgment of the best match between the clinical circumstances (eg, type of sleep problem, patient characteristics, expected duration of therapy), the individual properties of currently available drugs (eg, onset of action, safety, and tolerability), and any comorbid disorders (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], anxiety, or depression). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The duration of action of the medication is particularly important and should be appropriate for the presenting complaint: for children with sleep onset problems, a shorter-acting medication is generally desirable, whereas for sleep maintenance problems, longer-acting medications may be considered, while at the same time minimizing morning residual sleepiness or persistent grogginess. The properties of the sedative and hypnotic drugs are outlined in the following sections and accompanying tables. (See <a href=\"#H1141461264\" class=\"local\">'Nonprescription medications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3031819170\" class=\"local\">'Prescription insomnia drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2069754667\" class=\"local\">'Drugs used off-label for insomnia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Safety considerations:</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Consider potential drug interactions when selecting and dosing the sleep medication. Concurrent medications may have pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions, as for <span class=\"nowrap\">sedative/hypnotics</span> and opiates, or may have pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions, as for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a>, a CYP2D6 and 2C19 inhibitor. Potential interactions can be investigated with the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact) included with UpToDate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Specifically inquire about concurrent use of nonprescription sleep medications such as Tylenol PM, melatonin, or herbal preparations, which are often initiated by parents or by adolescent patients without consulting the clinician. While these medications are generally viewed by parents as &quot;safe,&quot; the potential drug&ndash;drug interactions between most herbal preparations and sedatives and hypnotics, as well as other medications, are largely unknown and thus pose a potential safety threat. Maintaining an open and nonjudgmental approach is key to optimal communication and allows for the development of more effective and appropriate treatment strategies in cooperation with the family.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess for risk factors for drug misuse or special adverse effects. Adolescents should be screened for alcohol and drug use, as well as pregnancy, prior to initiation of therapy, as many recreational substances may have synergistic clinical effects when combined with sedatives and hypnotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing &ndash; </strong>The medication<strong> </strong>should be initiated at the lowest level likely to be effective, and titrated up as necessary. This strategy is important because of the limited data on the PK and PD properties for hypnotic drugs in the pediatric population. For some medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">zolpidem</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]), evidence suggests that younger children may require higher dosing (per kg) compared with adults, due to differences in metabolism. For some medications, this difference in metabolism results in a paradoxical reaction, in which a dose that is not adequate to induce sleep causes initial grogginess, and subsequently agitation and disinhibition. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Timing &ndash; </strong>Drug administration should be tailored to the drug's onset of action and the target time of sleep onset. Because most hypnotic medications have their onset of action within 30 minutes of administration and peak within one to two hours, they should be administered shortly before bedtime for sleep onset insomnia, eg, within 30 minutes of lights out. Giving the medication too early, eg, more than two hours before desired sleep onset, is less likely to be effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticipatory guidance</strong> of the family includes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Make a plan for potential modifications in dosing and timing of administration, depending on the child's response. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clarify whether medication is to be used on a nightly or &quot;as needed&quot; basis. If the latter, clear parameters should be established regarding if and when medication should be administered (eg, if the child is not asleep within 60 minutes of lights out). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Specifically discuss the issue of dose escalation to avoid inadvertent over-dosage. Some caregivers may assume that if &quot;one pill doesn't work, then two (or three) might.&quot; This is particularly critical with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>. In general, dosage increases are best accomplished only after direct communication and consultation with the health care provider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration of pharmacotherapy</strong> &ndash; The duration of pharmacotherapy depends on the type of sleep problem and the child's response to medical and behavioral treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In general, medications should also be used for the shortest possible duration. However, the goal of limiting drug exposure should be balanced by ensuring adequate duration of therapy to allow behavioral interventions to be successfully implemented.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid abrupt discontinuation of sleep medication, especially for drugs with short and intermediate half-lives. Failure to wean sleep medications gradually may result in &quot;rebound insomnia,&quot; and may also increase the likelihood of other sleep disorders. For example, abrupt discontinuation of sleep medications that are potent rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suppressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) may result in a compensatory increase (rebound) in REM sleep and a subsequent increase in REM sleep-related phenomena, such as nightmares.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1141461264\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonprescription medications that are commonly used for insomnia in children are antihistamines and melatonin. Both have potential pitfalls and different uses. They are listed in alphabetical order below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447980782\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These medications can be considered for short-term situational or occasional use in younger children, especially those with comorbid atopic disease. Both prescription (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxyzine</a>) and nonprescription (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a>) antihistamines are the most commonly prescribed and recommended sedatives in pediatric practice. Parents and providers often choose antihistamines because of familiarity, and widespread clinical experience indicates that these medications are largely well-tolerated in children. However, tolerance to antihistamines tends to develop, necessitating increasing doses, and precluding their chronic use. The pros and cons of this class of medication are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112084\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112084 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>First-generation drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxyzine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpheniramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorpheniramine</a>) cross the blood&ndash;brain barrier and bind to histamine type 1 (H1) receptors in the brain. Second- and third-generation antihistamines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fexofenadine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">loratadine</a>, are significantly less sedating. They are generally rapidly absorbed and have rapid onset of action. Effects on sleep architecture are minimal. </p><p>The antihistamines <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">doxylamine</a> are in several nonprescription sleep aids. These drugs have modest efficacy in reducing sleep onset latency (SOL), as demonstrated in a few clinical trials, including in adults with psychiatric disorders. In children, there is mixed evidence for the efficacy of antihistamines for insomnia: A double-blind placebo-controlled pediatric study of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> showed significant subjective improvement in sleep latency and night wakings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although a subsequent study in 6- to 15-month-old infants found that diphenhydramine was no better than a placebo in reducing night wakings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) practice guideline suggests <strong>against</strong> the use of diphenhydramine for insomnia in adults, primarily because of small effect size and low-quality data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diphenhydramine'</a>.) </p><p>Potential side effects of antihistamines include daytime drowsiness, anticholinergic effects (eg, dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention), and paradoxical excitation; fatal overdoses with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a> have been reported in infants. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727571870\"><span class=\"h2\">Melatonin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best established use of melatonin is for patients with a documented circadian phase delay. Melatonin is also a reasonable choice for children with sleep onset insomnia who may need long-term pharmacotherapy, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&nbsp;(ADHD). Melatonin should not<em> </em>be used in healthy children without sleep problems to &quot;promote restful sleep,&quot; or in adolescents with biologically-based later sleep onset times in an attempt to &quot;force&quot; sleep onset and accommodate early school start times. The pros and cons of melatonin are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112085\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112085 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical effects</strong> &ndash; Melatonin is effective for management of chronic or acute circadian rhythm disturbances (eg, delayed sleep&ndash;wake phase disorder, jet lag) in both typically developing healthy children and adolescents and in children with neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders such as blindness and ASD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Melatonin also may be helpful in management of sleep onset insomnia in children, based primarily on data from patients with ADHD and autism. The rationale is based on the premise that at least some of these children have a circadian-mediated phase delay (ie, delayed sleep onset and offset compared with developmental norms). A meta-analysis of pediatric and adult trials concluded that melatonin advanced mean sleep onset by 0.67 hours, and decreased SOL by 23 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Meta-analyses in adults suggest marginal improvement in sleep latency, although overall quality of evidence for these studies was very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Due to paucity of data and low quality of evidence, the clinical practice guidelines for adults recommend against the use of melatonin for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia. However, the applicability of these data to pediatric populations is uncertain and clinical experience suggests that melatonin may be efficacious for some children and adolescents, particularly in those with comorbid ADHD or autism. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacology</strong> &ndash; Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in response to decreased light, mediated through the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The mechanism of action of commercially-available melatonin is to supplement the endogenous pineal hormone. The plasma level of exogenous melatonin peaks within about one hour of administration. Thus, it should be taken close to bedtime when given for sleep onset insomnia. When treating circadian phase delay, it is most effective when given several hours prior to bedtime. This is because exogenous melatonin given earlier than the time of its usual endogenous secretion helps to shift the circadian rhythm forward (earlier).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing and administration</strong> &ndash; Optimal dosing of melatonin depends on the type of sleep problem: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For circadian phase delay, starting doses of melatonin are 0.2 to 0.5 mg, given three to four hours prior to bedtime, and increased by 0.2 to 0.5 mg each week as needed to a maximum 3 mg for children or 5 mg for adolescents, as suggested in a consensus guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These relatively small doses and advance administration are more effective for circadian phase delay than larger doses or those given closer to sleep onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For sleep onset insomnia, typical doses are 1 mg in infants, 2.5 to 3 mg in older children, and 5 mg in adolescents, given 30 minutes before bedtime. Melatonin has mild hypnotic properties in these larger doses. Studies in children with autism have reported using doses of up to 10 mg. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is little evidence to support the efficacy of sustained release (controlled release, prolonged release) preparations in insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Melatonin is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, the commercially available formulations can vary in strength and accuracy in regards to concentration. A study analyzing 31 commercially available melatonin supplements with liquid chromatography found that actual melatonin content varied from -83 to +478 percent of the labelled content, and lot-to-lot variability was as much as 465 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Thus, we suggest that antidepressants should be used for insomnia only in the presence of comorbid mood issues. Treating the underlying mood disorder will often result in improved sleep, and successful sleep interventions often result in improvements in mood.

There is a risk of cardiotoxicity, especially in prepubertal children, and TCAs should be used with extreme caution in clinical situations in which a risk exists for accidental or intentional overdose. Most TCAs are potent REM sleep suppressants; thus, rapid withdrawal may lead to REM sleep rebound and nightmares. TCAs also tend to suppress SWS, and withdrawal may lead to SWS rebound and an increase in partial-arousal parasomnias such as sleepwalking and sleep terrors. TCAs have been used clinically to treat severe partial-arousal parasomnias because of these direct effects on SWS.

Furthermore, the sedating effects may interfere with daytime functioning and learning, and tolerance frequently develops, necessitating dose escalation. In addition, effects may appear on other sleep parameters; for example, many of the newer atypical antipsychotics have weight gain as a significant side effect, and thus can worsen sleep-disordered breathing. These agents also tend to suppress REM sleep and increase motor restlessness during sleep.</p><p>For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>, there have been a handful of case reports or case series reporting effective treatment of insomnia in special populations that have included children. However, a National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Panel on insomnia treatment in 2005 concluded that antipsychotic &quot;use in the treatment of chronic insomnia cannot be recommended&quot; due to the high risk-benefit ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-insomnia-in-children-and-adolescents-a-rational-approach/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloral-hydrate-united-states-not-available-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chloral hydrate</a> and barbiturates<strong> </strong>should not be used to treat insomnia in children because of significant side effects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3558109327\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-insomnia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Insomnia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4228544456\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are limited clinical scenarios in which pharmacotherapy is warranted for treatment of sleep problems in children. This is because the vast majority of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents are appropriately managed with behavioral therapy alone. Moreover, very little empirical data exist on the safety or effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for sleep problems in children. (See <a href=\"#H2609073293\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our clinical experience, pharmacotherapy is rarely necessary or appropriate for healthy children with sleep problems. Pharmacotherapy is more likely to be beneficial for children with complex medical, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental comorbidities. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to initiate pharmacotherapy should be made on a case-by-case basis, after a careful assessment of the sleep problem, including behavioral, medical, and psychosocial contributors. In most cases, behavioral interventions, including parenting strategies and attention to sleep hygiene, should be trialed before considering pharmacotherapy, and should continue during and after pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1133752404\" class=\"local\">'Decision to initiate pharmacotherapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of a medication depends on the best match between the clinical situation (type of sleep problem, patient characteristics, and expected duration of therapy), the individual properties of the drugs (onset of action, safety, and tolerability), and any comorbid disorders (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], anxiety, or depression). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antihistamines can be considered for short-term situational or occasional use in younger children, especially those with comorbid atopic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112084\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112084 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H447980782\" class=\"local\">'Antihistamines'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Melatonin is most appropriately used in patients with circadian phase delay. It may be effective for children with sleep onset insomnia who may need long-term pharmacotherapy, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or ADHD. Melatonin should not be used in healthy children without sleep problems to &quot;promote restful sleep&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112085\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112085 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H727571870\" class=\"local\">'Melatonin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Benzodiazepines (BZDs) have limited utility for sleep in pediatric populations, although their other properties, for example as long-acting anxiolytics, may be useful in some patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112087 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1393003957\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines*'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists (&quot;nonbenzodiazepines&quot;) have a more selective profile than BZDs, and are generally considered safe in adults. However, the few trials in children reported sleep-related behavior side effects, as well as lack of efficacy. These concerns limit their utility in children, except possibly in older adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112088 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H365875688\" class=\"local\">'Nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alpha adrenergic agonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanfacine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">guanfacine</a>) are commonly used off-label for treatment of insomnia in children, particularly those with sleep onset delay and ADHD, but data regarding safety and efficacy are limited (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112089 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1002161037\" class=\"local\">'Alpha-adrenergic agonists'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antidepressants should be used for insomnia only in the presence of comorbid mood issues, due to their potential side effects and lack of data on efficacy for sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112090\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112090 \">table 7</a>).
