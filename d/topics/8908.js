In human studies, the tested noxious stimulus is typically a skin incision. Thus, MAC is the effective dose (ED)<sub>50</sub> for absence of movement in response to surgical pain. Ablation of reflex arcs in the spinal cord involving sites of action that include the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and motor afferent neurons is thought to be the primary mechanism for absence of movement, without input from higher centers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MAC values differ for each inhalation anesthetic agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109494 \">table 3</a>). Only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) gas has a MAC value &gt;100 (105 percent at standard pressure and temperature).

Thus, MAC-awake is the ED<sub>50</sub> for response to voice or light touch and is thought to approximate the ED<sub>50</sub> required for perceptive awareness and anesthetic recall. For each inhalation agent, MAC-awake values are approximately 40 percent of the standard MAC value required to tolerate surgical stimuli without movement. Suppression of the brainstem and cortical centers involved in consciousness, in particular the reticular activating system, is thought to be the primary mechanism responsible for absence of response to voice or light touch. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3892670999\"><span class=\"h3\">Influence of drug-drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anesthetic effects of the different inhalation agents are additive.

Synergy is particularly common when drugs acting primarily on gamma-aminobutyric acid<sub>A</sub> (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors (eg, volatile inhalation agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>, benzodiazepines) are combined with drugs acting on other receptor types (eg, opioids). </p><p>MAC is decreased by acute alcohol use due to its sedative effects, or chronic use of amphetamines or alpha2 agonists, which may deplete central nervous system (CNS) catecholamine levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109495 \">table 4</a>). Conversely, MAC is increased by chronic alcohol use (likely due to enhanced hepatic metabolism) and by recent use of either amphetamines, cocaine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> since these agents may acutely increase CNS catecholamine levels that enhance focused consciousness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109495 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2587108057\"><span class=\"h3\">Influence of patient-related factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC values are also influenced by patient age and coexisting conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109495 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-clinical-effects-and-uses/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Also, the degree of skeletal muscle relaxation may be insufficient to prevent patient movement in response to all noxious surgical stimuli during light or moderate anesthetic depth. Thus, monitoring of the degree of neuromuscular blockade is recommended to achieve adequate skeletal muscle relaxation when desired, as well to ensure complete reversal when relaxation is no longer needed.

For example, uterine relaxation may be induced with administration of an inhalation anesthetic agent to facilitate extraction of retained products of conception. Other clinical effects resulting from skeletal smooth muscle relaxation may be detrimental. For example, gastrointestinal smooth muscle relaxation contributes to postoperative nausea, emesis, and ileus, while vesicoureteral smooth muscle relaxation contributes to postoperative urinary retention.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2821072375\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory effects</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3565125061\"><span class=\"h4\">Airway reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation of volatile anesthetic agents can produce airway irritation and may precipitate coughing or laryngospasm during induction of anesthesia, particularly with the more pungent agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>).

These responses increase risk for laryngospasm or emesis. As transition to Stage III and deeper levels of anesthesia occurs, laryngeal and pharyngeal airway reflexes are abolished, which facilitates laryngoscopy and intubation. However, risk for aspiration is present until the airway has been secured. Hence, an inhalation anesthetic induction technique is typically avoided in patients with pre-existing risk factors for aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3371472983\"><span class=\"h4\">Bronchial effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, halothane) are bronchodilators, decrease airway responsiveness, and attenuate bronchospasm. The bronchodilatory properties of the inhalation agents result from beta<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation, which results in an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, causing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-clinical-effects-and-uses/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In fact, volatile anesthetic agents may be used for treatment of severe status asthmaticus. Sevoflurane has the most pronounced bronchodilatory properties of the available inhalation anesthetics. Halothane was historically the agent of choice to prevent or treat bronchoconstriction, but it is no longer available in the United States.

During Stages III and IV, dose-dependent respiratory depressant effects of the inhalation agents progressively shift the respiratory carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) response curve to the right (blunting ventilatory response to hypercapnia), blunt the hypoxic ventilatory drive, and reverse hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (promoting perfusion of poorly ventilated lung, thereby increasing <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">[V/Q]</span> mismatch, which may result in hypoxia).</p><p>Interventions to assist or control ventilation typically become necessary, depending on the stage of anesthetic depth and the patient's clinical status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1365099616\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular effects</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potent volatile inhalation agents </strong>&ndash; The potent volatile anesthetics all induce myocardial depression with dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure (BP) and cardiac output, although the mechanisms for decline in BP and the degree of myocardial depression differ among agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113972 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-clinical-effects-and-uses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These effects may be beneficial in certain situations. For example, as anesthetic depth is increased with a volatile agent during induction, sympathetic stress responses are beneficially blunted in anticipation of noxious stimuli caused by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107796 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Isoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a> have primary vasodilatory properties, thereby reducing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with relatively little initial effect on cardiac inotropy. Isoflurane and desflurane tend to produce progressive tachycardia at progressively higher concentrations, and tachycardia may be seen with sevoflurane at concentrations &gt;1.0 MAC. In particular, desflurane may induce tachycardia and hypertension due to its sympathomimetic properties, particularly with high or abruptly increased concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Halothane preserves SVR but is a negative inotrope. In progressively higher doses, halothane also has negative chronotropic properties and may induce bradycardia or asystole, particularly in infants and young children who have relatively greater parasympathetic tone compared with adults. Also, halothane sensitizes the myocardium to catecholamines more readily than all other inhalation agents, and is thus associated with a higher incidence of ventricular and other dysrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although vascular, inotropic, and chronotropic effects of the potent volatile inhalation agents differ, at high concentrations that induce Stage IV anesthetic depth (significantly above 1.0 MAC) each of these agents eventually induces cardiovascular collapse due to progressive vasodilation, bradycardia, and negative inotropy. This is one manifestation of anesthetic overdose (ie, anesthetic depth that is &quot;too deep&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H4120616033\" class=\"local\">'Continuum of effect: sedation to general anesthesia'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrous oxide</a> &ndash; N<sub>2</sub>O induces few hemodynamic changes in most patients, in part because delivery of concentrations higher than approximately 0.75 MAC is not possible at standard ambient temperature and pressure.

Patients then transiently pass through Stage II, which is characterized by delirium, excitability, and an exaggerated response to any stimuli. This stage is likely to be more overt during administration of inhalation anesthetic agents rather than IV agents. Various ocular, laryngeal, and musculoskeletal responses are manifestations of Stage II. During Stage II, patients are particularly prone to laryngospasm, emesis, and aspiration of gastric contents. Management of these risks during Stage II involves maintenance of adequate ventilation, avoidance of unnecessary stimulation, and either rapid deepening of anesthesia to reach Stage III (surgical anesthesia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107796 \">table 1</a>), or termination of anesthetic administration if appropriate (eg, awakening the patient after an unsuccessful endotracheal intubation attempt in order to perform an alternative technique such as awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation).</p><p>Similar phenomena are evident during emergence from general anesthesia as the patient transitions from a deeper Stage III anesthetic state through a transient phase with delirium and agitation (Stage II), before becoming aware and responsive to commands (Stage I).

Due to its very low solubility in blood, the rate of rise of its alveolar concentration occurs very rapidly during inhalation induction. Since N<sub>2</sub>O has low potency it is rarely used as the sole anesthetic agent (MAC value is 104 percent); however, it is commonly coadministered with a potent volatile inhalation agent because its &quot;second gas&quot; effect hastens the onset of anesthesia and increases in anesthetic depth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-clinical-effects-and-uses/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Administration of N<sub>2</sub>O increases anesthetic depth, resulting in decreased dosing of other anesthetic agents. However, N<sub>2</sub>O cannot be used as a sole agent to maintain anesthesia because of its low potency (MAC value is 104 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-clinical-effects-and-uses/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedural sedation &mdash; N<sub>2</sub>O may be used during procedural sedation or as a self-administered agent for management of pain during labor and delivery.</p><p/><p>N<sub>2</sub>O use is always avoided in patients with pre-existing bowel distention, increased middle ear pressure, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumocephalus, intraocular gas, or venous air embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-clinical-effects-and-uses/abstract/2,10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,18</a>]. Also, N<sub>2</sub>O is typically avoided in patients with cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension because it causes mild myocardial depression and sympathetic nervous system stimulation with increases in pulmonary vascular resistance.
