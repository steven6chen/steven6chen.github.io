While all significant pericardial effusions are of clinical importance, emergency drainage is needed only for patients with hemodynamic compromise. Cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic collapse is an absolute indication for emergent pericardial drainage via pericardiocentesis or surgical pericardiotomy.</p><p>The lethality of pericardial effusions has been recognized for centuries. Riolanus suggested sternal trephination to release pericardial fluid in 1653 and the Spanish physician Romero described intercostal surgical drainage in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The Viennese thoracic surgeon Franz Schuh performed the first successful blind pericardial aspiration in 1840 via a left parasternal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Marfan later described the subxiphoid technique in 1911 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Despite significant complications and safety concerns, this remained the standard approach for blind pericardiocentesis through the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. Experience with echocardiography-directed pericardiocentesis paralleled technical advances in ultrasound during the 1970s, and has evolved as the procedure of choice due to its improved safety and efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Nonetheless, blind subcostal or parasternal pericardiocentesis remains a standard procedure for emergency pericardial drainage when ultrasound guidance is unavailable.</p><p>The indications, contraindications, preparation, equipment, and techniques of emergency pericardiocentesis will be reviewed here. Cardiac tamponade and its related diseases and non-emergent pericardiocentesis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac injury from blunt trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial disease associated with malignancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'Pericardial fluid drainage'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600602\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parietal pericardium is a fibrous sac that encloses the heart and the roots of the great vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67249 \">figure 1</a>). The cone-shaped sac rests on the diaphragm and fuses superiorly with the adventitia of the great vessels. The pericardium and heart lie between the pleural sacs. The pericardium is fixed within the thorax by attachments to the anterior diaphragm, the sternum, and the fourth and fifth left costal cartilages. The phrenic nerve innervates the pericardium as its runs between the mediastinal pleura and fibrous pericardium.</p><p>In health, the pericardium envelops the heart loosely, but is rigid enough to provide stability within the thoracic cavity and to limit cardiac distention (pericardial constraint). The normal pericardial space contains &lt;50 mL of thin serous lubricating fluid that is an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Lymphatic drainage of the pericardium to mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes provides the anatomic basis for pericardial involvement in the pathology of these regions.</p><p>Within the pericardium, the anterior sternocostal surface of the heart is dominated by low pressure right sided chambers while the left cardiac border and apex represent the left ventricle. The right coronary and left anterior descending coronary arteries course over the anterior surface of the heart where they are vulnerable to inadvertent puncture during pericardiocentesis.</p><p>Several other important vessels course along the thoracic cage. Intercostal vessels course in their respective neurovascular bundles at the inferior rib margin. Needle insertion over the superior rib margin avoids these structures. The internal thoracic (mammary) artery and vein courses parallel to the sternum 1 to 2 cm from the bony border before dividing into the superior epigastric and musculophrenic vessels at the sixth intercostal space.</p><p>When performing the procedure, clinicians should be aware of the vital structures in proximity to the heart. These include the lungs, liver, and diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80627\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80627 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Critical cardiac compression can occur with the accumulation of fluid, pus, blood, clot, or gas in the pericardium. The cardiovascular consequences depend upon the amount and speed of accumulation and the patient's physiologic reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cardiac tamponade represents the decompensated phase of cardiac compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600609\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no absolute contraindication to pericardiocentesis in an emergency. However, more definitive treatments should be considered if circumstances allow. Pericardiocentesis is a temporizing measure in acute traumatic hemopericardium and should not delay a more aggressive approach, such as emergency thoracotomy, when indicated. Such delays may increase mortality in traumatic hemopericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several relative contraindications to pericardiocentesis exist. Coagulopathy is an important consideration when deciding whether to perform any invasive procedure. Pericardiocentesis is relatively contraindicated when the effusion is associated with aortic dissection or myocardial rupture due to the potential risk of aggravating the dissection or rupture via rapid pericardial decompression and restoration of systemic arterial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, such concerns are secondary if an alternative life-saving solution is not immediately available. Controlled small-volume pericardiocentesis to relieve critical tamponade has been reported as a successful bridge to emergency surgery in two case series of tamponade associated with aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600616\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitor all critically ill patients continuously with both pulse oximetry and cardiac tracings. Before pericardiocentesis, provide airway and respiratory support as clinically indicated. Necessary interventions may range from supplemental oxygen to intubation and mechanical ventilation. Beware that a sudden decrease in preload and vasomotor tone, as occurs with rapid sequence intubation and positive-pressure ventilation, can cause acute decompensation, including cardiac arrest, in patients with tamponade physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. It is prudent to obtain emergent surgical consultation in case immediate surgical drainage is needed.</p><p>Monitoring the electrocardiograph (ECG) tracing while advancing the pericardiocentesis needle, enables the clinician to detect needle contact with the epicardium, which helps prevent cardiac puncture. To do this, attach an alligator clip to the base of the pericardiocentesis needle and monitor it via a precordial (V) lead of an ECG machine set to continuous rhythm display. In this configuration, the pericardiocentesis needle acts as an exploring electrode. </p><p>Contact of the needle with the epicardium is signaled by immediate ST and PR segment elevation with ventricular and atrial contact, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Should this occur, withdraw the needle immediately. ECG monitoring of the needle is not critical, and the practice may be omitted in an emergency, in the absence of essential equipment, or when there is concern for arrhythmias due to incomplete electrical grounding of the exploring electrode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/2,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,21</a>]. Ultrasound guidance obviates the need for ECG monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600623\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 7 to 9 cm, 18 gauge spinal needle and large volume (60 to 80 mL) syringe are the minimum supplies needed for blind pericardiocentesis. In infants and small children, a 20 gauge spinal needle is recommended and in older children, a 4 cm (1.5 inch) 16 to 18 gauge over the needle catheter may suffice. If the need for pericardiocentesis is anticipated, all equipment necessary to optimize the procedure should be prepared. An equipment list is provided in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72290 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Insertion of a pericardial drain is always preferred. If time allows, be sure to assemble these additional materials prior to performing the procedure. Preassembled pericardiocentesis sets are commercially available. Alternatively, a number of common six to eight French sterile catheters, including a pigtail catheter, introducer sheath, or single or multi-lumen central venous catheter, may be substituted as a pericardial drain. Prepackaged central venous catheter sets provide most of the supplies needed for emergency pericardiocentesis. Unlike a spinal needle, the thin-walled 18 gauge needle included in pericardiocentesis and central venous access kits accommodate a standard J-tip guidewire for subsequent drain deployment.</p><p>When using two-dimensional (2D) ultrasonography to guide pericardiocentesis, turn on the machine and allow it to warm up, and then adjust it to the appropriate parameters. The procedure is typically performed with a 2 to 4 megahertz (MHz) probe. A standard curvilinear probe works well for subcostal views but a small footprint curved transducer improves intercostal imaging. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600630\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600638\"><span class=\"h2\">General preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients experiencing hemodynamic collapse from cardiac tamponade are supine. Awake patients may experience profound dyspnea and orthopnea and require upright or semi-recumbent positioning for comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Positioning at 30 to 45 degrees increases dependent pooling of fluid and brings the heart closer to the chest wall. Sedation is rarely required and is not recommended in stuporous patients due to the risk of hemodynamic decompensation. If sedation is used in awake patients without obvious hemodynamic compromise, short-acting medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) are preferred.</p><p>The optimal approach to pericardial drainage depends upon patient habitus, the distribution of pericardial fluid, and the availability of ultrasound. Ultrasound, or echocardiography, is the most common means of confirming a pericardial effusion and enables safer and more reliable percutaneous drainage compared with a blind approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, blind pericardial drainage may be necessary for patients with suspected deterioration from cardiac tamponade and when ultrasound is unavailable. A high-quality video demonstrating emergency pericardiocentesis is available in the following reference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Despite the difficulties encountered in emergency circumstances, every effort should be made to use aseptic technique when performing emergency pericardiocentesis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare the skin by applying a chlorhexidine-based solution to the chest and upper abdomen and drape the region to maintain sterility during hardware manipulation.

(See <a href=\"#H24600645\" class=\"local\">'Selecting the approach for pericardiocentesis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Simple needle aspiration provides immediate hemodynamic benefit, but secondary placement of a pericardial drain is recommended to ensure continuous access. The Seldinger guidewire technique is preferred. Access to the pericardial space is gained using a 7 cm, 18 gauge, thin-walled introducer needle or sheathed catheter over needle assembly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600645\"><span class=\"h2\">Selecting the approach for pericardiocentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial fluid is not always circumferential or equally distributed within the pericardial sac. Loculation occurs in up to one-third of nontraumatic effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Also remember that the critical volume sufficient to cause tamponade is much smaller when pericardial fluid has accumulated rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound determination of the ideal drainage site and needle trajectory has supplanted estimation based upon palpation and percussion. Systematic ultrasound assessment is performed using several windows (subcostal, parasternal, and apical). Observational studies of pericardial effusion distribution suggest that several access sites in the left chest are superior to the traditional subxiphoid approach. Uncontrolled echocardiography-directed studies confirm successful aspiration from these sites in patients selected using real-time ultrasound guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/8,24,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24,29-31</a>]. Among potential chest sites, the left parasternal, and apical approaches are most commonly used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81176 \">figure 3</a>). The parasternal and apical approaches have not been studied in infants or children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600652\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcostal (subxiphoid)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extrapleural subcostal pericardiocentesis approach is performed as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81442\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81442 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/2,9,21,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,21,32,33</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduce the needle substernally 1 cm inferior to the left xiphocostal angle.

If no fluid is aspirated, the needle should be withdrawn promptly and redirected. In the absence of ultrasound guidance, withdraw the needle to the skin and redirect it along a deeper posterior trajectory. The required depth of insertion is affected by the patient's anatomy. In most cases, a 7 to 9 cm needle is adequate, but longer needles (up to 12 cm) may be needed for obese patients. In infants and small children, 4 cm (1.5 inch) needles are sufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If no fluid is aspirated on the second attempt, withdraw the needle to the skin and redirect it 15 degrees to the patient's right of the last dry needle path. Perform systematic redirected aspirations by working from the patient's left to right until the needle is aimed toward the right shoulder. </p><p/><p>Ultrasound guidance generally enables the clinician to avoid inserting the needle into other organs. However, interposition of the left liver lobe is often recognized on subcostal imaging and the lobe may be traversed intentionally during pericardiocentesis, if an alternative site is not available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600659\"><span class=\"h3\">Parasternal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The left sternal border is the landmark for a parasternal approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54637\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54637 \">figure 5</a>). Left parasternal access is most frequently used.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the needle perpendicular to the skin and over the cephalad border of the fifth or sixth rib immediately adjacent to the sternal margin.

However, proximity to the left pleural space increases the risk for pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The apical insertion site is at least 5 cm lateral to the parasternal approach within the fifth, sixth, or seventh intercostal space.

This site contains the largest pericardial fluid accumulation that is closest to the chest wall and can be entered without puncturing any adjacent vital organs. Patient repositioning (eg, reverse Trendelenburg) may redistribute pericardial fluid and affect the target window.

Ultrasound does not pass through air so the lung is avoided if the needle trajectory mirrors the approach delineated by ultrasound.</p><p/><p>One of three techniques may be employed for ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Static</strong> imaging uses ultrasound guidance for procedure planning, but does not provide real-time ultrasound imaging during the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Remote</strong> guidance uses ultrasound to view the heart and effusion during the procedure but rarely provides direct observation of needle penetration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dynamic</strong> guidance uses real time ultrasound imagery to view and guide the needle during the approach and pericardial puncture.</p><p/><p>There is little data to support any one technique, and the clinician should determine the best approach based on experience and available resources.</p><p>Static imaging using pre-procedure ultrasound to assess the puncture site and angle is the traditional method. With static imaging, the skin puncture site and trajectory are outlined with two skin marks. The needle trajectory mirrors the transducer angle during ultrasonography of the target effusion. Note this angle carefully while imaging the effusion. Measure the distance from the skin to the pericardium overlying the target effusion; the distance is typically 2 to 4 cm. Contrast injection and fluid removal may be monitored from a remote transducer position. An observational study of this technique reported successful placement in all 21 patients with no observed complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>For the dynamic approach, orient and insert the needle parallel to the localizing ultrasound beam to obtain an in-plane approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. At the parasternal site, this may require a medial to lateral needle trajectory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Real-time ultrasound visualization of needle passage is optimal, but continuous visualization of the needle tip may be difficult. Misinterpretation of the ultrasound image can result in inadvertent needle misdirection outside of the predetermined trajectory. Use of a needle guide affixed to the ultrasound probe may help align the needle for dynamic ultrasound guided insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/31,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H800834\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardiocentesis technique without ultrasound guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When ultrasound is not available, perform emergent pericardiocentesis as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare the patient and necessary equipment as above.

Agitated saline bubble contrast can be prepared by rapidly mixing 9 mL of saline with 1 mL of air between two syringes, connected via a three-way stopcock, immediately before injection. Layering of contrast outside the heart confirms pericardial localization. Rapid contrast washout or intracardiac swirling varies with the patient's cardiac output, but both signify myocardial perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Once the catheter is in place, aspirate pericardial fluid rapidly using a large syringe (60 to 80 mL) until cardiopulmonary compromise is relieved. Place a three-way stopcock between the catheter and aspirating syringe to aid in rapid serial aspirations while maintaining sterility. Limit acute total drainage of large effusions to less than 1 L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/9,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,51</a>]. Keep the catheter connected to a sterile closed drainage system after initial aspiration. Do not use continuous negative pressure systems or vacuum containers.</p><p>Anticipate pericardial reaccumulation after initial decompression. Avoid continuous drainage because of the high rate of catheter occlusion; intermittent drainage optimizes drain patency. Flush the indwelling catheter with 5 mL of sterile or heparinized saline between aspirations, performed every four to six hours or as clinically indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Inadequate initial drainage or reaccumulation despite a functioning drain indicates the need for immediate surgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24600709\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large observational studies of non-emergency echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis report a major complication rate of &lt;2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/29,30,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,52,53</a>]. However, delayed clinical decompensation following attempted and successful pericardiocentesis may also reflect procedural complications. </p><p>The most serious and immediate mechanical complications of pericardiocentesis are myocardial puncture or laceration, vascular injury (coronary, intercostal, internal mammary, or intraabdominal), pneumothorax, air embolism, and arrhythmia (ventricular and supraventricular). Myocardial and coronary puncture may be initially silent and present with delayed hemopericardium that is poorly responsive to needle or catheter aspiration.</p><p>Purposeful or inadvertent transperitoneal needle passage can traverse intraabdominal organs. The liver is most commonly involved, but is associated with low risk of significant hemorrhage. Perforation of a hollow viscus is theoretically possible but rarely reported.</p><p>Vasovagal response to pericardial decompression occurs in up to 25 percent of patients and may be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38</a>]. Successful pericardial decompression may also induce acute left or right ventricular dysfunction unrelated to anatomic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/51,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54-56</a>].</p><p>Lastly, pericardiocentesis may fail to relieve tamponade. Loculated effusion and acute hemopericardium are factors associated with unsuccessful catheter drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-pericardiocentesis/abstract/27,29,30,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1617332\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade represent a spectrum of disease with wide variation in clinical presentation. The cardiovascular consequences of pericardial effusion depend upon the amount of fluid, the speed with which it accumulates, and the patient's physiologic reserve. Emergency drainage is needed only for patients with hemodynamic compromise. Cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic collapse is an absolute indication for emergent pericardial drainage via pericardiocentesis or surgical pericardiotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H24600602\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and physiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24600609\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring of patients needing emergency pericardiocentesis is performed with pulse oximetry and cardiac tracings. Monitoring the electrocardiogram tracing while advancing the pericardiocentesis needle can help prevent cardiac puncture, but it is not essential, especially when ultrasound guidance is used. Before pericardiocentesis, provide airway and respiratory support as clinically indicated. Beware that a sudden decrease in preload, as occurs with tracheal intubation and positive-pressure ventilation, can cause acute decompensation, including cardiac arrest, in patients with tamponade. (See <a href=\"#H24600616\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The materials needed to perform emergency pericardiocentesis are described in the text and listed in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72290 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24600623\" class=\"local\">'Materials'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to pericardial drainage depends upon patient habitus, the distribution of pericardial fluid, and the availability of ultrasound. Pericardial fluid is not always circumferential or equally distributed within the pericardial sac. Loculation occurs in up to one-third of nontraumatic effusions. Ultrasound is the most common means of confirming a pericardial effusion and enables safer and more reliable percutaneous drainage compared with a blind approach. However, blind pericardial drainage may be necessary for patients with suspected deterioration from cardiac tamponade and when ultrasound is unavailable. (See <a href=\"#H24600638\" class=\"local\">'General preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational studies of pericardial collection distribution suggest that several chest access sites are frequently superior to the traditional subxiphoid approach. Ultrasound often demonstrates the left parasternal and apical sites as optimal approaches. (See <a href=\"#H24600645\" class=\"local\">'Selecting the approach for pericardiocentesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The performance of both ultrasound-guided and blind emergency pericardiocentesis is described in the text.
