It makes thyroid hormone. This hormone controls how the body uses and stores energy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Hypothyroidism is the medical term for when a person does not make enough thyroid hormone. People sometimes confuse this condition with HYPERthyroidism, which is when a person makes too much thyroid hormone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471114821\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with hypothyroidism have no symptoms. But most people feel tired. That can make the condition hard to diagnose, because a lot of conditions can make you tired.</p><p>Other symptoms of hypothyroidism include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting cold easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developing coarse or thin hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting constipated (having too few bowel movements)</p><p/><p>If it is not treated, hypothyroidism can also weaken and slow your heart. This can make you feel out of breath or tired when you exercise and cause swelling (fluid buildup) in your ankles. Untreated hypothyroidism can also increase your blood pressure and raise your cholesterol &ndash; both of which increase the risk of heart trouble.</p><p>In women, hypothyroidism can disrupt monthly periods. It can also make it hard to get pregnant. In women who do get pregnant, hypothyroidism can cause problems. For instance, it can increase the chances of having a miscarriage and of having a baby with low intelligence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471114828\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hypothyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can test you for hypothyroidism using a simple blood test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471114835\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hypothyroidism treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for hypothyroidism involves taking thyroid hormone pills every day. After you take the pills for about 6 weeks, your doctor or nurse will test your blood to make sure the levels are where they should be. He or she might adjust your dose depending on the results. Most people with hypothyroidism need to be on thyroid pills for the rest of their life.</p><p>Thyroid hormone pills come in different brand name and generic forms. All the pills work equally well. But you should not switch from one generic or brand name to another. Switching between pills can cause your levels to go up and down.</p><p>Never change your dose of thyroid hormone on your own. Taking too much thyroid hormone can cause heart rhythm problems and even damage your bones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471114842\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can try to get pregnant. Many women with hypothyroidism have healthy pregnancies. But your doctor or nurse will most likely need to change your dose of thyroid hormone once you are pregnant. That's because you need more thyroid hormone during pregnancy. He or she will also measure your levels of thyroid hormone 4 weeks after any change in your dose, and at least once during each trimester of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471114849\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroiditis-after-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thyroiditis after pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
