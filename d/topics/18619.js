A &quot;fracture&quot; is another word for a broken bone. A vertebral compression fracture is when a back bone breaks by collapsing.</p><p>Vertebral compression fractures happen most often in older people who have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease that makes the bones weak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28191488\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a vertebral compression fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with a vertebral compression fracture have no symptoms. They find out they have it after their doctor does an X-ray of their chest or belly for another reason.</p><p>When a vertebral compression fracture causes symptoms, it causes back pain. The pain usually starts suddenly after a fall or after bending, coughing, or lifting. But sometimes the pain starts slowly. The pain can be dull or sharp, and often spreads to the belly.</p><p>Over time, people with vertebral compression fractures can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get shorter (lose height)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a bent posture with a hunched back</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28191503\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check if you have a vertebral compression fracture, your doctor will order an X-ray.</p><p>He or she will also do other tests to see if another condition caused your fracture. These can include blood tests, urine tests, or imaging tests. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>If you have a vertebral compression fracture, your doctor will probably order bone density testing. Bone density testing is a way for your doctor to measure how strong your bones are. The test used most often to measure bone density is a special kind of X-ray called a &quot;DXA test.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28191518\"><span class=\"h1\">How are vertebral compression fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for a vertebral compression fracture involves different parts.</p><p>Your doctor will treat your pain. Depending on how severe your pain is, your doctor can treat it with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong pain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over-the-counter pain medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines that are used to treat osteoporosis, but can also relieve pain</p><p/><p>Your doctor will also treat your osteoporosis. Long-term osteoporosis treatment includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors usually treat osteoporosis with medicines called bisphosphonates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle changes &ndash; Your doctor or nurse will talk with you about ways to keep your bones as healthy as possible. He or she will probably recommend that you stop smoking (if you smoke) and that you not drink too much alcohol. You should also eat a healthy diet with enough calcium and vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; It's important to be active for at least 30 minutes a day, on most days of the week. &quot;Weight-bearing&quot; exercise, such as walking, is best. Weight-bearing exercise means that your feet and legs support your weight.</p><p/><p>You might have heard or read about other treatments that are sometimes used for vertebral compression fractures. For example, some people might wear a back brace. Back braces sometimes help people who have a fracture from a serious car accident. They do not usually help people who have a fracture from osteoporosis.</p><p>Other treatments that are sometimes used for vertebral compression fractures are procedures called &quot;vertebroplasty&quot; and &quot;kyphoplasty.&quot; These involve putting a cement material or device into the collapsed back bone. Doctors do not always agree about whether these treatments help. Many doctors do not recommend that people with a vertebral compression fracture from osteoporosis have these treatments. That's because they don't know how much they help with pain, and they can have serious downsides. Other doctors recommend these treatments for people with severe, disabling pain that does not improve with strong pain medicines, or people with severe pain who cannot take strong pain medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28191556\"><span class=\"h1\">When will the pain from my fracture get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most people, the pain will get better in 4 to 6 weeks. But people can have pain that lasts up to 3 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28191571\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help with healing, you can follow all of your doctor's instructions. This will probably include doing gentle back stretches while your fracture is healing, and other back exercises when your pain gets better. To learn which stretches and exercises to do, your doctor might have you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert).</p><p>It's important to be active as soon as possible after your pain gets better. Being active will help keep your back and bones as strong as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28191586\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe pain, or pain that gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have numbness or weakness in your legs or feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot control your bladder or bowels</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28191601\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone density testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
