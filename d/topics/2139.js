The majority of blunt aortic injuries are due to motor vehicle collision. In the United States, blunt aortic injury is the second leading cause of death behind head injury for individuals aged 4 to 34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Only approximately 20 percent of patients with blunt aortic injury survive long enough following the injury to be treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The presence of risk factors for blunt aortic injury should prompt a diagnostic evaluation, the nature of which depends upon the patient's clinical status. The grade of injury taken together with the patient's associated injuries and medical comorbidities determine the timing and type of thoracic aortic repair. </p><p>Blunt thoracic aortic injury will be reviewed here. The factors that determine whether an open surgical or endovascular approach should be taken to repair these injuries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066952814\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of blunt thoracic aortic injury is estimated between 1.5 and 2 percent of patients who sustain blunt thoracic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. In a multicenter study involving 274 cases of blunt aortic injury, 81 percent were caused by automobile collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other etiologies of blunt thoracic aortic injury include motorcycle and aircraft crashes, automobile versus pedestrian accidents, falls, and crush injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately 70 percent of victims are male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], with approximately 67 percent of patients described as overweight or obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The main risk factor for blunt thoracic aortic injury is rapid deceleration, either from high-speed motor vehicle collision or falls from a significant height. Injury mechanism and other patient-related factors that increase the risk for blunt thoracic aortic injury are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933010575\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Associated injuries are common. The incidence of associated injuries in patients with blunt aortic injury was 81.4 percent in one autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one series of 71 patients treated with endovascular repair of thoracic aortic injury, the mean injury severity score (ISS) was high at 43, indicating multiple associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Associated injuries include severe head injury, lung contusion, cardiac contusion, intraabdominal hemorrhage, long bone fracture, pelvic fracture, and blunt diaphragmatic rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>].</p><p>Injuries associated with blunt thoracic aortic injury in unrestrained drivers may differ from those of unrestrained front seat passengers. In one study, injured organs from drivers appeared to be related to thoracic and abdominal compression leading to liver, sternal, and diaphragmatic injury, but for front seat passengers, associated head and the neck injuries were more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The pattern of associated injuries may suggest different pathophysiologic mechanisms for aortic injury. (See <a href=\"#H1066952822\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066952822\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most blunt injuries of the thoracic aorta occur at the aortic isthmus just distal to the left subclavian artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other locations include the transverse arch, proximal ascending aorta, and descending aorta just proximal to the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17</a>].</p><p>A number of theories are used to explain the mechanism of thoracic aortic injury at the isthmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/11,14,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,18-22</a>]. It is likely that most injuries probably involve a combination of forces. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The isthmus is thought to be a transition zone between the more mobile ascending aorta and arch and the relatively fixed descending thoracic aorta that allows for stretching with rapid deceleration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The isthmus may be intrinsically weaker than the remainder of the aorta as evidenced by a series of tensile strength tests conducted on aortic samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt aortic injury may be the result of a &quot;water hammer&quot; effect in which compression of the abdomen due to a sudden impact occludes the aorta, leading to rupture of the proximal, intrinsically weak isthmus or other susceptible portion of the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This proposed mechanism may explain the association between blunt aortic injury and diaphragmatic rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;osseous pinch,&quot; theory purports that the aorta is trapped between the anterior bony structures (manubrium, first rib, medial clavicles, and sternum) and the vertebral column leading to focal rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p>Regardless of the force mechanism leading to tissue disruption, it appears that the time course of aortic rupture occurs as two distinct phases separated by an interval of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22</a>]. Rupture of the intimal and medial layers occurs first, followed by an interval of unpredictable duration, and then rupture of the adventitia. The duration of time between <span class=\"nowrap\">intima/medial</span> injury and adventitial rupture may be from seconds to several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In an in-vitro study of porcine aortic injury, an intimal-medial tear occurred before complete disruption of the entire vessel in 93 percent of specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Partial aortic disruption occurred at a mean mechanical stress that was 74 percent of the stress needed for complete rupture. These findings suggest that a sufficient residual strength exists in the aortic wall following the initial injury to allow timely diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In an autopsy study, multiple tears occurred in 21 of the 51 subjects in whom aortic tears were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Tears of the media occurred in more than 60 percent of cases. Similarly, in the porcine model of aortic injury described above, multiple intimal and medial injuries were present in 74 percent of specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13964813\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation and management of the trauma patient with blunt or penetrating trauma based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The initial resuscitation and evaluation of the patient with blunt trauma is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early identification of diagnosis of blunt aortic injury is critical since approximately 30 percent of patients with blunt aortic injury who survive long enough to reach the hospital will die within 24 hours if untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Clinical findings associated with blunt thoracic aortic injury are discussed below. </p><p>In the setting of injury, many patients have altered mental status (eg, neurologic injury) or are intubated and sedated and cannot relate their symptoms or medical history. Every attempt should be made to identify any preexisting medical conditions by contacting the patient's primary care physician or family members. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066952845\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no symptoms or clinical signs of sufficient sensitivity to accurately diagnose thoracic aortic injury. The trauma patient may complain of chest pain, intrascapular pain, or difficulty breathing or swallowing, but these symptoms are not specific for blunt thoracic aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>On physical examination, signs of significant chest wall trauma such as a steering wheel or seatbelt imprint on the surface of the skin may suggest a mechanism of injury consistent with blunt thoracic aortic injury. Other clinical signs that suggest thoracic aortic injury include a cardiac or interscapular murmur (not previously known) or left subclavicular hematoma. Upper extremity hypertension, also known as pseudocoarctation, or bilateral femoral pulse deficit, can also be a sign of aortic injury or rupture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933010769\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain chest film</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A plain anteroposterior chest film is routinely obtained as part of the evaluation of blunt thoracic trauma. Findings on chest radiograph may indicate the need for further testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73037 \">algorithm 1</a>), typically using chest computed tomography (CT), which reliably establishes a diagnosis of blunt thoracic aortic injury.

The initial evaluation and indication for imaging patients with blunt chest trauma are discussed elsewhere. The specific issues related to blunt aortic injury and findings related to blunt aortic injury are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Chest CT: Indications, accuracy, and decision rules'</a> and <a href=\"#H13964813\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933011299\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging options include transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, each of which has high sensitivity for this injury. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable, transesophageal echocardiography can be performed at the bedside, or in the operating room prior to exploration, whereas hemodynamically stable patients should undergo chest CT with intravenous contrast. </p><p>Chest CT is a highly sensitive and specific test for thoracic aortic injury and is the diagnostic test of choice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62204 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/4-6,13,28-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,13,28-34</a>]. Thoracic aortography is no longer routinely used to identify blunt aortic injury because it is invasive and associated with delays related to the need to set up the interventional suite and call in appropriate personnel (interventionalist, nursing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]). However, aortography may be needed where newer-generation CT scanning is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Compared with multidetector chest CT, the sensitivity of aortography may be slightly inferior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>]. In a study of 494 patients of whom 71 had blunt thoracic aortic injury, the sensitivity of CT approached 100 percent compared with 92 percent for aortography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another review, 272 patients were followed a mean of 615 days from the time of blunt chest trauma after blunt thoracic aortic injury was excluded by chest CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No procedures for injuries to the aorta or great vessels were needed, and there were no deaths related to blunt aortic injury. </p><p>Findings on chest CT indicative of blunt thoracic aortic injury are listed below and illustrated in the images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88623%7ERADIOL%2F88625%7ERADIOL%2F88626\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88623 graphicRef88625 graphicRef88626 \">image 2A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The pain from an acute aortic dissection is described as searing and often begins in the chest, migrating into the abdomen over time. Aortic dissection may affect other arch vessels leading to other symptoms (cerebral embolism, upper extremity ischemia), that are not as likely in patients with only a blunt thoracic aortic injury. </p><p>Thoracic aortic imaging will differentiate aortic dissection and other thoracic pathologies from the typical appearance of blunt thoracic aortic injury. However, in patients with blunt chest injury, blunt aortic injury and other aortic pathologies can coexist. Blunt chest trauma may have precipitated rupture in patients with pre-existing thoracic aortic pathology, such as chronic aortic dissection or aortic pseudoaneurysm due to erosion of ulcerated plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Alternatively, thoracic dissection may have extended from a region of blunt aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933048310\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial resuscitation and management of blunt aortic injury includes placement of two large bore peripheral intravenous catheters for medication and fluid resuscitation, and for patients whose systolic blood pressure is more than 100 mmHg, we suggest antihypertensive therapy with impulse control (negative inotropic therapy) to reduce the risk of extending the injury (intimal, medial, or adventitial) and rupture, and potentially reduce the volume of blood loss if ruptured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2670133\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart rate and blood pressure control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no randomized trials, observational studies suggest a mortality benefit for antihypertensive therapy with impulse control (negative inotropic therapy) for the treatment of blunt aortic injury compared with historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Prior to the routine use of antihypertensive therapy for blunt aortic injury, mortality in the emergency department was approximately 12 percent in hemodynamically stable patients awaiting surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/32,44,45,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,44,45,47,48</a>]. In one prospective study, 71 patients awaiting repair were treated to manage their heart rate and blood pressure with a goal systolic blood pressure of approximately 100 mmHg and a pulse rate of &lt;100 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this study, no patient had an aortic rupture while waiting for repair.</p><p>The patient's heart rate and blood pressure should be controlled with a beta blocker, if not contraindicated. The goal heart rate is &lt;100 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>, a rapidly acting beta blocker with a short half-life, is ideal for this purpose. Beta blockade should be in effect before additional medications are used. A calcium channel blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> can be used if beta blockers are contraindicated. If beta blocker therapy alone has not achieved the goal of maintaining the systolic blood pressure at 100 mmHg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> can be added.</p><p>The duration of antihypertensive therapy in patients who will not undergo surgery has not been studied.

Approximately 10 percent of patients with blunt aortic injury have changes identified by multidetector computed tomography (CT) that are characterized as &quot;minimal&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>The meaning of &quot;minimal aortic injury&quot; remains unclear and the term has been used to represent relatively small lesions, including isolated intimal defects without extravasation of blood, and for describing anything less than a small pseudoaneurysm.

Based upon Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles, hemodynamically unstable trauma patients should be taken to the operating room for emergent exploration to determine the source of hemorrhage, which could be in the chest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdomen. If the source of hemodynamic instability is blunt aortic injury, it should be immediately repaired. If aortic injury is identified but life-threatening bleeding from another source is controlled (eg, spleen, liver, pelvic fracture), aortic repair can be delayed to allow resuscitation of the patient (damage control approach). (See <a href=\"#H1759284759\" class=\"local\">'Immediate versus delayed repair'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to the advent of high quality computed tomography of the chest, blunt thoracic aortic injuries were uniformly taken to the operating room for open surgical repair when the injury was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

While awaiting repair, heart rate and blood pressure should be aggressively controlled and serial imaging should be performed. Once associated major injuries are stabilized, the aortic injury can be repaired, generally with less anesthetic and surgical risk.

In a systematic review from EAST that included seven comparative studies (some exclusively open surgical repair, others open or endovascular repair), the pooled risks for death and paraplegia were significantly higher for early compared with delayed surgical repair [death: risk ratio (RR) 2.07 (95% CI 1.03-4.15); paraplegia: RR 5.90 (95% CI 1.51-22.9)] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the studies included a total of 481 patients (78 from an institutional review and 403 identified from the National Trauma Databank), mortality was significantly higher in each group among those who underwent early open surgical repair (20 versus 9 percent in the institutional review, and 22 versus 14 percent in the NTDB review) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Blunt thoracic aortic injury is a major cause of rapid death following motor vehicle collision. Only approximately 20 percent of patients survive long enough following injury to undergo treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1066952806\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1066952814\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical evaluation of the trauma patient should assess the risk for blunt thoracic aortic injury based upon injury mechanism. The main risk factor for blunt thoracic aortic injury is rapid deceleration, either from high-speed motor vehicle collision or falls from a significant height. The majority of blunt injuries to the thoracic aorta occur at aortic isthmus just distal to the left subclavian artery and a number of theories are used to explain the predilection for this site. (See <a href=\"#H1066952814\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1066952822\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The routine evaluation of the patient with blunt thoracic injury includes a plain chest radiograph. Findings suggestive of thoracic aortic injury on examination or the chest radiograph may indicate the need for further imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73037 \">algorithm 1</a>) using computed tomography (CT) of the chest or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), each of which reliably establishes a diagnosis of blunt thoracic aortic injury.
