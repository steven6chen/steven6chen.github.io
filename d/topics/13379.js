We agree with the 2007 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association focused update on STEMI, which considers less than 50 percent resolution in the ECG lead showing the greatest degree of ST-segment elevation at presentation as a marker of failure of fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-coronary-intervention-after-fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>PCI in this setting is called rescue or salvage PCI and is the best therapeutic intervention for primary fibrinolytic failure.

After apparently successful fibrinolysis by either clinical or angiographic criteria, early recurrence of ischemia or ST segment shifts (threatened reocclusion) has been observed in 20 to 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-coronary-intervention-after-fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], thrombotic coronary reocclusion in 5 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-coronary-intervention-after-fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>], and reinfarction in 3 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-coronary-intervention-after-fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>In two reviews of almost 76,000 patients from GUSTO-I, GUSTO-III, and the TIMI and InTIME II trials, reinfarction occurred in 4.3 percent of patients at a median of two to four days after fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-coronary-intervention-after-fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Among the patients who were randomized, facilitated PCI with tenecteplase was associated with significant increases in the primary end point of death, heart failure, or shock within 90 days (19 versus 13 percent, relative risk 1.39, 95% CI 1.11-1.74) and in the rate of in-hospital stroke (1.8 versus 0 percent; 8 of 13 classified strokes were due to intracranial hemorrhage) and, at 90 days, reinfarction (6 versus 4 percent) and target vessel revascularization (7 versus 3 percent). One explanation for the adverse effects are that relative to primary PCI, the fibrinolytic agent can induce a higher risk of recurrent thrombosis. In addition, in this study, the median time between tenecteplase and PCI was 104 minutes.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Facilitated PCI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend coronary angiography with an intent to perform PCI of the infarct-related artery rather than a strategy of PCI for ischemia only (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients with high-risk features, including but not limited to anterior MI, Killip class &ge;2, inferior MI with evidence of right ventricular involvement, systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mmHg, and heart rate &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> angiography should be performed as soon as possible after two hours have passed since fibrinolysis.<br/><br/>For patients not at high risk, the optimal timing of routine angiography and possible PCI for such patients has not been determined. We believe that it should be performed within 3 to 24 hours. <br/><br/>While we recommend diagnostic coronary angiography for all patients who receive fibrinolytic therapy, we recognize that some patients at very low risk will be managed with a conservative strategy of &quot;watchful waiting&quot; with monitoring for spontaneous recurrent ischemia and, if not is seen, stress testing should be performed to evaluate for provocable ischemia. If ischemia is present, patients should undergo angiography and revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have recurrent angina or ischemia on pre-discharge stress testing should undergo prompt coronary arteriography followed by PCI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (based upon anatomic considerations), as opposed to a trial of medical therapy.
