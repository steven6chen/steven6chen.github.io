On the other hand, infection is one of the most morbid complications of ERCP and among the most common causes of ERCP-related death. Septic complications of ERCP include ascending cholangitis, liver abscess, acute cholecystitis, infected pancreatic pseudocyst, infection following perforation of a viscus, and less commonly, <span class=\"nowrap\">endocarditis/endovasculitis</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The post-ERCP septic complications of acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, and pancreatic sepsis will be reviewed here. Post-ERCP perforation and general overviews of acute cholangitis and acute cholecystitis are discussed separately.

In patients with a normal biliary tract, anatomical barriers impede both these routes. In contrast, patients who are immunocompromised or who have obstruction of the biliary system have impaired bacterial defenses, making them more susceptible to these complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The most frequent organisms responsible for post-ERCP infections are enteric bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Although polymicrobial enteric flora are often found in infected bile, single organisms are isolated from blood cultures in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the 1980s, cross infection via contaminated endoscopes and ancillary ERCP equipment, such as cannulation catheters, was implicated in severe cases or outbreaks of septicemia from pseudomonas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Improvements in the methods of disinfection have now made such nosocomial infections rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>However, in recent years, outbreaks of multidrug-resistant pathogens (<em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) associated with ERCP procedures have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>]. The source of infection may be related to difficulty cleaning the elevator mechanism of duodenoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>]. Therefore, when reprocessing duodenoscopes, the scientific societies and manufacturers recommend strict adherence to guidelines and reprocessing protocols. The risk of transmitting infection and protocols for disinfecting duodenoscopes are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscope-disinfection#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscope disinfection&quot;, section on 'Endoscope reprocessing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIPROCEDURAL BACTEREMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP can lead to transient bacteremia that, in most cases, is not clinically significant. Variable rates of up to 15 percent have been reported for diagnostic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] and of up to 27 percent for therapeutic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>]. Differences in specimen collection, timing of blood cultures, and culture techniques may explain the variable estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Bacteria isolated from the blood following ERCP are commonly oropharyngeal flora, particularly alpha-hemolytic streptococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. Entrance into the blood stream is presumably through minor trauma by the endoscope, similar to bacteremia that has been observed with tooth brushing or after diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Asymptomatic periprocedural bacteremia rarely leads to clinical sepsis in immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As a result, bacteremic episodes occurring during ERCP do not appear to have clinically significant consequences. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not warranted in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASCENDING CHOLANGITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascending cholangitis, while uncommon, is the most frequent infectious complication of ERCP. Clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain that result from stasis and infection in the biliary tract. In the setting of ERCP, it is most often due to incomplete drainage of an infected and obstructed biliary system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the incidence of clinically significant cholangitis have ranged from 0.4 to more than 10 percent in various reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/3,5,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,27-30</a>]. In a summary of 21 prospective studies involving 16,855 patients between 1987 and 2003, infection occurred in 1.4 percent (0.2 percent were severe), with a periprocedural mortality rate of 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar rates of infection (1.0 to 2.2 percent) were reported in other large studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for cholangitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to achieve drainage of an obstructed biliary system is the most important predictor of post-ERCP biliary sepsis. The mechanism by which obstruction leads to sepsis is presumed to be elevated biliary pressure causing biliary-venous reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The risk of cholangitis varies depending upon the nature and site of the obstruction. Patients with malignant hilar obstructions and those with sclerosing cholangitis are at particularly increased risk of cholangitis due to difficulty in achieving complete drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/8,31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31-37</a>]. Cholangitis is also a frequent complication of occluded biliary stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The importance of incomplete drainage as a risk factor for cholangitis was illustrated in two retrospective series in which incomplete biliary drainage was present in 87 and 90 percent of patients who developed sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. High rates of cholangitis in patients with incomplete biliary drainage were also found in a prospective study of 242 patients undergoing sphincterotomy for bile duct stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Cholangitis developed in 75 percent of patients with retained stones and failed biliary drainage and in 40 percent of those with a precut papillotomy and unsuccessful drainage. By comparison, cholangitis developed in only 3 percent of patients with successful drainage.</p><p>The risk of cholangitis in patients with bile duct stones treated with mechanical lithotripsy (which may result in retained stone fragments <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> require multiple sessions for duct clearance) is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-bile-duct-stones-standard-techniques-and-mechanical-lithotripsy#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of bile duct stones: Standard techniques and mechanical lithotripsy&quot;, section on 'Mechanical lithotripsy'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to incomplete biliary drainage, other risk factors for cholangitis have been identified in prospective studies. These include jaundice, a small endoscopy center, combined percutaneous-endoscopic procedures, stenting of malignant strictures, and a delay in performing ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. A retrospective analysis of 168 consecutive patients admitted for acute cholangitis found that a delay in performing ERCP, development of post-ERCP adverse events, and etiology of cholangitis not related to stones increased the risk of 30-day readmissions. The overall readmission rate was 22 percent and recurrence of cholangitis was the most common etiology for readmissions (37.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In two studies of patients who underwent ERCP with cholangioscopy, rates of post-procedure bacteremia ranged between 9 and 19 percent, and the rate of cholangitis was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In one study, 72 patients who underwent single-operator choledochoscopy were examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Of 14 patients (19 percent) with sustained bacteremia following ERCP or choledochoscopy, 10 patients (14 percent) had sustained bacteremia related to choledochoscopy. Despite the use of post-procedure intravenous antibiotic administration, seven patients (9.7 percent) required further antibiotic treatment for infectious complications, three of whom (4 percent) were hospitalized in order to receive intravenous antibiotic therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholangitis typically develops within 24 to 72 hours after ERCP in patients with failed biliary drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/7,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,39</a>]. The classic triad of Charcot (fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice) occurs in only 50 to 75 percent of patients with acute cholangitis. Confusion and hypotension can occur in patients with suppurative cholangitis, producing Reynolds pentad, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including multiorgan failure due to septic shock. Hypotension may be the only presenting symptom in elderly patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Severe cases may also be associated with the development of a hepatic abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications/abstract/7,9,40,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,40,45,46</a>].
