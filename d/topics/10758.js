These processes impair oxygenation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The clinical manifestations of severe venous hypertension and tissue hypoxia are edema, hyperpigmentation, subcutaneous fibrosis, and ulcer formation.</p><p>The medical management of chronic venous disease with and without ulceration is discussed here.

(See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Skin care'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1000014219\" class=\"local\">'Contact dermatitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Venous ulceration is treated with a combination of ulcer wound management and compression therapy in the form of compression hosiery or compression bandaging systems. The treatment of chronic venous insufficiency with ulceration requires lifestyle changes to achieve treatment goals. An algorithm for medical management is based upon available data and published recommendations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50126\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50126 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Compression therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Ulcer care'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=compression-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-venous-insufficiency#H68314433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Compression therapy for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency&quot;, section on 'Static compression therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Superficial vein ablation has been evaluated both for the treatment of venous ulcers and for prevention of recurrence. Surgery is thought to produce beneficial effects via reduction of venous reflux from the deep to the superficial veins by ablating or removing incompetent perforating and superficial veins, thereby modifying the effect of venous hypertension upon the cutaneous tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The role of venous ablation therapy in the treatment of lower extremity chronic venous disease with or without ulceration is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MEASURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Leg elevation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple elevation of the feet to at least heart level for 30 minutes three or four times per day improves cutaneous microcirculation and reduces edema in patients with chronic venous disease. In one study of 15 patients with lipodermatosclerosis, leg elevation resulted in a 41 percent increase in blood flow velocity as measured by Doppler fluximetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Limb elevation also promotes healing of venous ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>Leg elevation alone may be sufficient to relieve symptoms in patients with mild venous disease, but is usually not adequate in more severe cases. It may also not be practical for some people to elevate their legs several times per day because of the nature of their work. Elevation of the feet below the level of the heart, such as in a lounge chair, is ineffective for reducing venous hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daily walking and simple ankle flexion exercises while seated are inexpensive and safe strategies in the management of chronic venous disease. Several small studies have shown improvement in hemodynamic parameters with simple calf muscle (plantar flexion) exercises but the impact on preventing or healing venous ulcers is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>The efficiency of the calf muscle pump in pushing venous blood up the legs is usually impaired in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, contributing to the development and delayed healing of venous ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Moreover, physical activity in patients with chronic venous insufficiency and ulceration tends to be very limited. In one study, 35 percent of the patients did not have a 10 minute walk even once a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPRESSION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Static compression therapy is an essential component in the treatment of chronic venous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. The options, characteristics, and choice of compression hosiery or compression bandages, and in particular for their use in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=compression-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-venous-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Compression therapy for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234417471\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy and choice of compression</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234417534\"><span class=\"h3\">Superficial reflux and varicose veins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with varicose veins report rapid symptomatic improvement with use of compression hosiery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. However, due to methodological shortcomings, there are few high quality data that demonstrate the effectiveness of compression hosiery for managing symptomatic varicose veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of compression therapy, symptoms subjectively improved but outcomes were not compared with a control arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the absence of clinical data, if the patient tolerates wearing compression hosiery, most patients can determine within a short period of time if their symptoms are sufficiently controlled enough to continue therapy, or whether to seek additional treatment. Treatment algorithms in studies comparing various endovenous therapies typically use a threshold of three months of conservative management prior to offering treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, many insurance companies also use a threshold of three months of conservative management using compression hosiery prior to allowing invasive varicose vein treatments.

Issues related to the initial choice and application of compression therapy, in particular for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=compression-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-venous-insufficiency#H68314463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Compression therapy for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency&quot;, section on 'Choice of initial therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of systemic agents have been used in the management of chronic venous disease. These are generally categorized as those that affect venous tone (ie, venoactive agents) such as the flavonoids (includes rutin, rutosides) and others; and those that affect the flow properties of blood (ie, rheologic agents) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>, prostacyclin analogs, stanazol, sulodexide, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=defibrotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">defibrotide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. </p><p>Most studies evaluating these agents provide only low-quality evidence of benefit. As an example, only 28 percent of the studies included in the Cochrane review discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] provided standard diagnostic criteria for chronic venous insufficiency, and misclassification of disease is possible. The studies used different methods to identify signs and symptoms. The outcomes were not categorized by severity of disease. Importantly, most of these agents have been studied over relatively short durations, typically three months, thus long-term efficacy and safety cannot be assured. </p><p>It is important to note that diuretics have no role in the treatment of edema due solely to chronic venous insufficiency; however, diuretics may be prescribed as a treatment for other medical conditions that exacerbate lower extremity edema (eg, heart failure, renal dysfunction) and worsen lower extremity symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-treatment-of-edema-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the treatment of edema in adults&quot;, section on 'General principles of therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H17676502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Diuretic'</a>.) </p><p>Systemic antibiotic therapy is only indicated in the context of active infection.

Other actions include reduction of capillary hyperpermeability, improved lymphatic drainage, antiinflammatory effects, and decreased blood viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. These agents may be useful for managing any class of venous disease. </p><p>Available trials studying venoactive drugs are generally small but support their effectiveness for relieving venous edema and related symptoms such as extremity heaviness and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>]. In a Cochrane review, although these agents overall showed beneficial effects for reducing edema and ankle circumference (mean difference -4.27 mm, 95% CI -5.61 to -2.93 mm), there were no differences in the proportion of ulcers healed compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>In the United States some venoactive drugs are available without a prescription as dietary supplements. Concerns over accuracy of labeling, lack of standardization, and potential presence of undisclosed ingredients in dietary supplements sold in the United States are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;, section on 'Quality'</a>.)</p><p>Flavonoids include rutin, rutoside, diosmin and hidrosmin, disodium flavodate, pycnogenol, french maritime pine bark extract, grape seed extract, and various combinations of these. These agents appear to be safe when administered during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The most studied of these are reviewed briefly below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234418498\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydroxyethylrutoside</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydroxyethylrutoside (HR, oxerutin) is well tolerated and effective at reducing leg volume, edema, and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It has been used in Europe for more than 30 years where standardized preparations are available (eg, Paroven), but is not available in the United States. HR is well tolerated for at least six months, even in the elderly, but longer follow-up is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>HR is a standard mixture of semisynthetic flavonoids that act mainly upon the endothelium of the microvasculature to reduce permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The efficacy of HR for the management of symptoms associated with chronic venous insufficiency was analyzed in a meta-analysis of 15 randomized placebo controlled trials involving over 1900 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The HR group had a significantly higher response (disappearance of symptoms) in all categories examined, including pain (38 versus 27 percent with placebo), cramps (38 versus 26 percent), tired legs (34 versus 22 percent), swelling (49 versus 35 percent), and restless legs (50 versus 26 percent).</p><p>In one study, 75 percent of patients achieved a positive response with HR, which was superior to horse chestnut seed extract (HCE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a second study, the combined treatment of compression hosiery and HR was superior to compression hosiery plus placebo in the reduction of leg volume; similar to HCE, the treatment effect was noted for six weeks after withdrawal of the active drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

A systematic review of randomized trials concluded that while use of flavonoids was associated with an increased number of healed ulcers, this result needed to be interpreted cautiously as most of these trials were subject to a risk of bias in favor of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234418673\"><span class=\"h3\">Escin (horse chestnut seed extract)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Horse chestnut seed extract (HCE) at a dose of 300 mg (standardized to 50 mg of escin [aescin], the active compound) twice daily may be used in patients unable or unwilling to use compression, or for those in whom compression is contraindicated (eg, occlusive arterial disease). HCE reduces leg volume and edema in patients with chronic venous insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/32,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,35</a>]. In the United States it can be purchased without a prescription as a dietary supplement, but its purity and standardization cannot be guaranteed.

Patients were allocated to usual care (compression and local ulcer care) or usual care plus MPFF, two 500 mg tablets daily. The rate of ulcer healing at six months was significantly higher in the MPFF group compared with usual care (61.3 versus 47.6 percent), and time to healing was less (16 versus 21 weeks).
