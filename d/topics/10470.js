These symptoms include agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, wandering, depression, apathy, disinhibition, and sleep disturbances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95072 \">table 1</a>). One or more of these symptoms are observed in 60 to 90 percent of patients with dementia; the prevalence increases with disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>Behavioral disturbances commonly peak in the late afternoon or evening, a phenomenon often referred to as &quot;sundowning.&quot; Sundowning affects up to two-thirds of patients with dementia and is closely related to disturbed circadian rhythms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Risk factors include poor light exposure and disturbed sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Sophisticated neuroimaging techniques are increasingly able to define neuroanatomic substrates for some of these behaviors; in particular, the right hemisphere and right frontal lobe appear important in the mediation of social and emotional behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms leads to greater functional impairment in patients with dementia and cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>]. Agitation, hallucinations, depression, and aggression in patients with dementia often lead to nursing home placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/11,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15-18</a>].</p><p>Delusions are more common than hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), with a reported prevalence of 30 percent in patients with severe AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A long-term follow-up study suggests that it may be more pervasive; among 456 patients with mild to moderate AD followed for a mean of 4.5 years, 34 percent had delusions at baseline, but 70 percent had them during at least one evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hallucinations were present in 7 percent at baseline and in 33 percent at some point over the course of follow-up.</p><p>Paranoid delusions in particular can be very distressing to the patient or caregivers. Common paranoid delusions include beliefs that the house has been invaded, that personal objects have been misplaced or stolen, that family members have been replaced by impostors (Capgras syndrome), or that spouses have been unfaithful.</p><p>The presence of visual hallucinations early in the course of a dementing illness suggests dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) disease, a disorder with very specific management issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Delusions or hallucinations may be fleeting or unobtrusive. Pharmacotherapy is not necessary if neither the patient nor the family are disturbed by them; therapy is warranted if these symptoms become problematic, particularly if the hallucinations are frightening. The presence of either delusions or hallucinations is associated with increased risk for cognitive and functional decline; hallucinations predict institutionalization and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF NEW OR WORSENING SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia should be done at regular follow-up visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. New or worsening symptoms should prompt assessment of safety and evaluation for an underlying cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F115346\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115346 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4150913868\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess risk of harm and ensure safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with new or worsening agitation may pose safety risks to themselves or others. When severe, agitation may require an elevated level of care, either temporarily or indefinitely. Safety strategies may include a higher level of practical support for family and other caregivers, increased one-on-one supervision, inpatient hospitalization, and, if risk or distress is severe, short-term pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1560970394\" class=\"local\">'Severe or refractory symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Assessing the associated caregiver distress is also important in determining the urgency of intervention. In some cases, aggression may manifest as abusive behavior toward the caregiver. Distressed or overburdened caregivers may benefit from increased supportive services, education, and community resources. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Support for caregivers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270370739\"><span class=\"h2\">Search for an underlying cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agitation and other behavioral abnormalities can arise from a variety of underlying causes in patients with dementia, and identifying the genesis of the abnormal behavior is critical to effective management. In many patients, behavioral changes herald a new infection or medication toxicity. In others, agitation is driven by pain, fear, confusion, or poor sleep. As with physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, no single approach or medication can be expected to treat the symptom of agitation without regard to the underlying cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270370732\"><span class=\"h3\">Delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by impairments in attention and behavior developing over a short period of time and often fluctuating over the course of the day. The most common causes of delirium are medical illnesses, substance intoxication, and medication side effects.</p><p>A concomitant medical illness (particularly urinary tract infection or pneumonia) and other causes of delirium must be considered whenever new behavioral disturbances arise in patients with dementia, particularly in the setting of an acute worsening in cognition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Most behavioral symptoms have precipitants.</p><p>These possibilities should be ruled out prior to initiation of any treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181737064\"><span class=\"h3\">Medication side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication toxicity is a common precipitant of neurobehavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Individuals with dementia have an increased risk of adverse cognitive effects from a range of medications, both prescribed and over-the-counter.</p><p>In particular, clinicians should consider anticholinergic side effects of drugs used to treat sleep disturbance, bladder incontinence, or other illnesses. Benzodiazepines are another common class of drugs that should generally be avoided in patients with dementia due to risk of adverse cognitive effects, among others. (See <a href=\"#H1560970387\" class=\"local\">'Drugs to avoid'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560972488\"><span class=\"h3\">Other precipitating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from delirium, common causes of agitation that should be considered in all patients with new or worsening behavioral changes include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion or misunderstanding due to cognitive, language, or memory deficits &ndash; If aggression appears to emerge in moments of confusion, behavioral management is usually sufficient after analysis of the antecedent behaviors, eg, bathing, new or strange people walking by. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frightening, paranoid delusions &ndash; If delusions appear to trigger aggression, pharmacologic treatment may be helpful or necessary, depending upon the severity of the symptom. (See <a href=\"#H1560970394\" class=\"local\">'Severe or refractory symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or discomfort &ndash; Adults with mild to moderate dementia can report pain reliably; for patients with advanced dementia, clinicians must rely on caregiver reports and observational scales. (See <a href=\"#H270370704\" class=\"local\">'Pain assessment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression &ndash; Agitation or aggression may be the primary manifestation of depression in a patient too impaired to express distress in any other manner. A therapeutic trial with antidepressant medication may be the only reasonable diagnostic strategy in difficult cases. (See <a href=\"#H367079604\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disorders &ndash; Sleep-wake disturbances are common in patients with dementia and can be caused by a variety of factors. When sleep disturbances are prominent, daytime agitation is unlikely to improve until sleep has been optimized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disturbances and sleep disorders in patients with dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory deficits &ndash; Poor vision and hearing loss can exacerbate confusion, hinder communication, and increase risk of falls. Poor vision can also be a source of visual hallucinations.

Both interview and observation should be used to determine whether pain reporting represents pain-related suffering, pain perseveration, or a signal of some other type of distress.

For the most part, positive trials demonstrated evidence of short-term but not long-term benefit, or did not include long-term follow-up results.</p><p>Behavioral interventions employ different strategies and techniques. These include identifying any preceding events that generate agitation, determining whether unmet needs can be anticipated and alleviated, and avoiding environmental triggers such as a sudden change in surroundings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F98510\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98510 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>].</p><p>As one example, a randomized, controlled trial studied 73 residents of skilled nursing homes who had aggression or agitation with assisted bathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Treatment groups were a usual care control group (showering); &quot;person-centered showering,&quot; an intervention focused on resident comfort and preferences; and &quot;towel-bath,&quot; an in-bed bag bath method that kept the resident covered at all times and cleansed by using gentle massage. Both treatment groups showed significant declines in all measures of agitation, aggression, and discomfort compared with controls. The postulated mechanism underlying the effectiveness of the improved personal care involved a reduction in the insistent, task-focused, impersonal, and intrusive &quot;usual care&quot; methods that can provoke agitation and aggression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Other nonpharmacologic therapies have demonstrated some benefit for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in small studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aromatherapy has been studied in several small randomized trials in patients with dementia and agitation, with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Aromatherapy is safe and well tolerated. Lemon balm or lavender oil are most frequently used and can be delivered by either inhalation or skin application. The mechanism by which these agents may be effective is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise training in combination with caregiver education may improve outcomes in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). A randomized trial in 153 community-dwelling patients with AD found that compared with routine medical care, patients who were assigned to exercise (goal minimum of 30 minutes per day) and whose caregivers received training in managing behavioral problems had improved physical functioning and less depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Median time to discontinuation of drug for any reason was similar in all four groups (5.3 to 8.1 weeks). However, more patients taking placebo discontinued medication for lack of efficacy compared with those on olanzapine or risperidone (70 versus 39 and 44 percent, respectively). For patients still taking the assigned treatment at 12 weeks, there were no differences among groups in the percentages of patients who improved on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale (range 21 to 32 percent). One limitation of the study was the inclusion of patients with a broad array of behavioral symptoms. It seems likely that a subset of patients, perhaps those with hallucinations, would have shown more clear improvement. However, the general use of antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD should be avoided, as the benefit is likely to be small and offset by adverse effects.

An <span class=\"nowrap\">activity/exercise</span> program, increasing natural light exposure during the mornings, limiting evening beverages, and elimination of evening alcohol and coffee are all useful in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Recognition and treatment of such disorders, such as restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (common among patients with Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], and multiple system atrophy) is important and may result in improved daytime symptoms.

The issue of wandering and becoming lost, with the attendant potential for physical harm or death, is one of the concerns that often leads families and caregivers to place patients with dementia in nursing homes. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety and societal issues related to dementia&quot;, section on 'Wandering and becoming lost'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560969786\"><span class=\"h1\">SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveys and observational studies report that a significant minority (15 to 25 percent) of patients with dementia exhibit sexually inappropriate behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/146-150\" class=\"abstract_t\">146-150</a>]. This may be an underestimate, as caregivers may be embarrassed to report this behavior to a clinician. Examples of sexually inappropriate behavior include inappropriate explicit sex talk and sex acts (grabbing, fondling, public masturbation, exposing). Other behavioral symptoms (agitation, aggression, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression) are usually present. This problem occurs in vascular dementia as well as Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias.</p><p>A limited number of studies have investigated this problem, almost always in men, and usually in the form of small case series or case reports. Efficacy has been reported with a variety of psychotropic medications including antidepressants, antipsychotic agents, and cholinesterase inhibitors, as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pindolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pindolol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/150-154\" class=\"abstract_t\">150-154</a>]. Hormonal agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>, diethylstilbestrol, estrogen, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a>) have also been used with anecdotal reports of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/150,153-155\" class=\"abstract_t\">150,153-155</a>]. However, given their side effect profile, these are not considered first-line agents.</p><p>Given the absence of controlled clinical data, treatment for this problem is necessarily empiric. Behavioral interventions (redirection, distraction, avoiding stimulants) should be tried first. If this is insufficient, medication trials seem reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/147,153\" class=\"abstract_t\">147,153</a>]. One systematic review concluded that the preponderance of anecdotal data provided the most support for antidepressant agents, making these the first drug of choice (see <a href=\"#H611864373\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Another valid approach may be to examine the context of other behavioral symptoms that the patient may be experiencing and to try an agent that seems most appropriate for the overall symptom complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caregivers of patients with dementia can suffer significant stress, particularly as cognitive function declines or behavioral symptoms worsen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. Respite care and support groups are available in most areas, often through the local agency on aging.</p><p>A variety of caregiver intervention studies have been performed, assessing both short-term and long-term outcomes, with mixed results. Most, but not all, have shown that counseling and support interventions benefit caregivers in the short term as measured by a reduction in stress and improvement in emotional wellbeing and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/157-159\" class=\"abstract_t\">157-159</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial that included 260 caregivers of family members with dementia found that an eight-session educational program was associated with decreased caregiver anxiety and depression scores and improved quality of life over an eight-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. A randomized study using a different intervention (access to a volunteer &quot;befriender&quot; trained to give psychosocial support to caregivers) was less successful, and the majority of caregivers in the intervention group did not take up the volunteer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].</p><p>Optimizing caregiver support might also help to keep patients with dementia cared for in the home. A meta-analysis of 13 studies of support programs for caregivers found that interventions designed to provide support for caregivers decreased the odds of institutionalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. Among the heterogeneous and usually multicomponent interventions used, no specific type stood out as most effective. However, those that allowed individualization and choice by the caregiver seemed more effective than those that were more rigorously standardized.</p><p>Nationally, information can be obtained from the Alzheimer's Association at 1-800-272-3900, or on the internet at <a href=\"http://www.alz.org/&amp;token=0SM8TegfFRL7gaY+yqo9TIzF4NFgBRokcVREgaqxgUU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5082\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.alz.org</a>.

Agitation and other behavioral abnormalities can arise from a variety of underlying causes in patients with dementia, and identifying the genesis of the abnormal behavior is critical to effective management.

Both interview and observation should be used to determine whether pain reporting represents pain-related suffering, pain perseveration, or a signal of some other type of distress. Pain management and drug prescribing should be approached pragmatically, using a stepped-care approach and starting low and titrating slowly.

Based on its favorable safety and tolerability profile, at least in short-term studies, we suggest a trial of dextromethorphan-quinidine in outpatients with refractory agitation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The lack of long-term safety and efficacy data, high cost of the combination pill, and paucity of data in nursing home patients are important considerations that may limit use until further studies have been performed.
