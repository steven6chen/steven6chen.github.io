Such injuries account for approximately one-sixth of fractures treated in United States emergency departments (EDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Familiarity with wrist anatomy and the natural history of major fracture types is essential for appropriate management of distal radius fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This topic review will discuss the evaluation and management of distal radius fractures in adults. Other wrist injuries are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of over 1.4 million United States emergency department (ED) visits found that hand and forearm fractures account for 1.5 percent of all visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of these, fractures of the radius <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ulna comprise the largest portion (44 percent).</p><p>The majority of distal radius fractures occur as isolated injuries in two distinct populations: youth involved in sport who sustain a relatively high-energy fall, and seniors with osteoporotic bone who sustain a low-energy fall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Athletics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism for sustaining wrist fractures among young people varies according to the local popularity of different physical activities. A Scottish study of distal radius fractures related to sport found that football (ie, soccer) produced 50 percent of fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Play on artificial turf increased the likelihood of fracture by a factor of five. Skiing, dancing, and rugby caused 12, 9, and 7 percent of wrist fractures, respectively. More severe injuries occurred as a result of skiing, horseback riding, and dancing.</p><p>The increasingly popular sport of snowboarding has a high rate of associated extremity fractures, including those of the distal radius. Physicians at a Japanese hospital caring for more than 10 ski areas evaluated over 5000 snowboarders for injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They found most distal radius fractures occurred in patients in their 20s (82.3 percent) without extensive snowboarding experience (42 percent novices; 48 percent intermediates). Ninety-four percent of patients had not received professional instruction, and 87 percent were not wearing protective equipment. Although less likely to be injured, more experienced snowboarders were more likely to sustain a complex intraarticular fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Geriatric population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age and gender both play a role in the risk of distal radius fracture. At 50 years of age, a white woman from the United States or Northern Europe has approximately a 15 percent lifetime risk of a distal radius fracture; a man in the same regions has a lifetime risk of just over 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>One large, prospective study of distal radius fractures among Caucasian women with osteoporosis, over the age of 65, involved in low-energy falls, found three statistically significant, independent risk factors: decreased bone density at the distal radius (relative risk [RR] = 1.8), a history of recurrent falls (RR = 1.6), and previous fragility fracture after age 50 (RR = 1.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For women over 75 years of age, dementia was an additional risk factor. Use of oral estrogen was found to be protective, and intraarticular fractures were more than twice as frequent in women with diabetes.</p><p>Among elderly men, distal radius fracture appears to be an early and sensitive marker of skeletal fragility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. More than any other fracture type, distal radius fractures correlate with a higher absolute risk for hip fracture in men (among women spinal compression fracture correlates more closely). A smaller study found shorter-than-expected life expectancy among patients with distal radius fractures when compared with peers of comparable age, gender, and comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After sustaining this fracture, men were twice as likely to die as women with the same injury and did so almost twice as quickly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although older patients sustaining low-energy distal radius fractures represent an important population for osteoporosis screening and treatment, the opportunity is often missed. One Canadian study evaluated osteoporosis follow-up and treatment in a group of 156 patients who sustained a low-energy distal radius fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They found that 32 percent of patients were receiving osteoporosis treatment before their injury, but after fracturing their radius only 21 percent more received osteoporosis screening, and only a few more began receiving a bisphosphonate or hormone replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H395494646\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the wrist is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common mechanism of distal radius fractures is Falling On an Out-Stretched Hand (sometimes abbreviated as FOOSH), with the wrist in extension. Minimal force is needed to produce a distal radius fracture in osteoporotic bone, and injury can occur after a fall from standing height or lower.</p><p>In healthy young patients, distal radius fractures often occur after violent injuries directly to the bone or by a compression load driving the scaphoid or lunate into the distal radius, producing a &quot;die-punch&quot; fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Such high-energy fractures are more likely to be comminuted and intraarticular, and to occur in association with other significant injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with a distal radius fracture usually describes falling onto their outstretched hand or sustaining a blow to the wrist, and complains of wrist pain, and possibly deformity. In addition to standard inquiries about the mechanism of injury, the clinician should ask about any previous wrist injuries or surgery, and any resultant abnormal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Also important are medical conditions affecting the injured extremity, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or peripheral vascular disease.</p><p>The clinician should inspect the injured extremity for swelling, deformity, and evidence of a possible open fracture. Swelling may or may not have developed by the time of presentation. Obvious deformities, such as the classic &quot;dinner-fork&quot; deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78559\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78559 \">figure 1</a>) associated with Colles' fractures, can occur, but the extremity may appear normal.</p><p>Examination includes an assessment of neurovascular status, including motor and sensory function of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves. Particular attention should be paid to sensation in the thumb and index fingers because acute median nerve compression is common, especially with severely displaced fractures. The clinician should assess circulation by palpating the radial pulse and testing capillary refill of the nail beds and fingertips. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Range of motion of the wrist, including supination, pronation, flexion, and extension should be evaluated if possible. Ulnar deviation with palpation of the anatomic snuffbox is important to ascertain the presence of a scaphoid fracture. Clinical evaluation of a distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) injury associated with a distal radius fracture is difficult. Ulnar-sided wrist pain and tenderness may be present due to a DRUJ or ulnar styloid injury.</p><p>In order not to miss associated injuries, the clinician should examine the involved extremity in its entirety, particularly the elbow and shoulder joints. A detailed description of the examination of the wrist and other joints is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of elbow pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When reading radiographs of distal radius fractures, clinicians should seek to answer four important questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there loss of normal anatomy (eg, fracture displacement or angulation, loss of radial height)? (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic landmarks and measurements'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there involvement of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar joint?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If joints are involved, is there discontinuity of the articular surface (ie, articular step-off) or diastasis (ie, separation) of the articular fragments?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are high-risk features present (eg, severe comminution, articular step-off &gt;2 mm, fracture-dislocation)?

Radiographic evaluation of the distal radius includes true posterior-anterior (PA) and true lateral projections. Oblique radiographs often are included as a supplemental view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Each view contains a small number of important landmarks and measurements for proper interpretation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior-anterior (PA) radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Landmarks on the PA projection include the radial and ulnar styloids, the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and the radiocarpal joint, including the proximal carpal bones. Important radiographic measurements include radial inclination, radial height, and ulnar variance.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radial inclination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73876 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82065 \">figure 2</a>) is the angle between one line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the radius and a second line drawn between the distal tip of the radial styloid and the central reference point (CRP). The CRP lies midway between the palmar ulnar corner and the dorsal ulnar corner of the distal radius (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62135\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62135 \">image 2</a>). The average angle is approximately 20 to 25 degrees, although there are slight gender differences (24.7 &plusmn; 2.5 for women; 22.5 &plusmn; 2.1 for men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The angle is often smaller with distal radius fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radial height (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73876 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82065 \">figure 2</a>) is the distance between two lines drawn perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radial shaft: one through the distal tip of the radial styloid and the second through the CRP. Normal height averages 11.6 &plusmn; 1.6 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The measured height is often smaller with distal radius fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulnar variance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73876 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82065 \">figure 2</a>) is the distance between two lines drawn perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radial shaft: one through the distal articular surface of the ulnar head and the second through the CRP. Normally, the radial surface is distal to the ulnar surface by 1 to 2 mm (negative ulnar variance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When the ulnar surface is distal to the radial surface (positive ulnar variance), the biomechanics of the wrist can be impaired, especially if the distance is 5 mm greater than the contralateral wrist.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a true lateral projection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52912\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52912 \">image 3</a>), the radius and ulna should be superimposed, and the pisiform projected over the distal pole of the scaphoid. If the pisiform is found dorsal to the scaphoid, the patient is in relative pronation; if found palmar, the patient is in relative supination. Normally, the lunate is seated within the fossa of the distal radius, and the curvature of their articular surfaces should correspond. The central axis of the lunate should be collinear with the central axis of the radius. Palmar migration is a sign of radiocarpal instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The most important measurement on a lateral projection is palmar tilt (ie, volar tilt). AP distance may also be helpful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palmar tilt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52912\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52912 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62727 \">figure 3</a>) is the angle formed by the intersection of one line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radial shaft and a second line drawn through the apices of the palmar and the dorsal rims of the radius. The normal palmar tilt on a standard lateral projection averages 11.2 &plusmn; 4.6 degrees and does not differ between genders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A smaller palmar tilt as a result of fracture is a risk factor for subsequent pain and disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AP distance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52912\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52912 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62727 \">figure 3</a>) lies between the apices of the dorsal and palmar rims of the radius. Normally, AP distance should be slightly larger than the width of the lunate, and it averages 19.1 &plusmn; 1.7 mm. It is significantly larger in males (20.4 &plusmn; 1.1) versus females (17.8 &plusmn; 1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It can increase as a result of axial impaction injuries and suggests articular step-off.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although numerous classification systems exist for distal radius fractures, none is used universally. Distal radius fractures can be described using either a fragment-specific classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] or the standard Frykman classification. The Frykman classification system divides the fractures among four main groups based upon joint involvement. Within each major grouping, fractures with even numbers involve a concomitant ulnar styloid fracture. Frykman categories are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II:</span> Completely extraarticular; complications are uncommon once anatomic alignment has been achieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61535%7EEM%2F74330%7EEM%2F78794\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61535 graphicRef74330 graphicRef78794 \">image 4A-C</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV:</span> Extend into the radiocarpal joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66573%7EEM%2F79669\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66573 graphicRef79669 \">image 5A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types <span class=\"nowrap\">V/VI:</span> Extend into the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89599\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89599 \">image 6</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types <span class=\"nowrap\">VII/VIII:</span> Involve both radiocarpal and DRUJ articular surfaces and are highly unstable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89600\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89600 \">image 7</a>)</p><p/><p>Two common eponyms associated with distal radius fractures are Colles and Smith. Colles' fractures involve dorsal displacement of the distal radius fragment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61535%7EEM%2F74330%7EEM%2F78794\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61535 graphicRef74330 graphicRef78794 \">image 4A-C</a>); Smith's fractures involve palmar displacement of the distal radius fragment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture dislocations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two major types of radiocarpal fracture dislocations exist: Barton's and Hutchinson's.</p><p>Barton's fractures are separated into palmar and dorsal. They are best seen on lateral radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89597\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89597 \">image 8</a>). Palmar Barton's fractures occur when the palmar radiocarpal ligaments avulse a radial fragment and displace the radiocarpal unit volarly. In a dorsal Barton's fracture, the dorsal radiocarpal ligaments avulse a radial fragment and displace the radiocarpal unit dorsally. In both types, the distal radius fragment maintains articulation with the carpus, accounting for the dislocation and instability. Closed reduction can be attempted, but these fractures are very unstable and reduction is usually lost. Barton's fractures generally require operative fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>A second type of fracture dislocation carries the eponym of Hutchinson's fracture, and it is also called the chauffeur's fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89667\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89667 \">image 9</a>). The typical mechanism is a direct blow to the radial styloid (such as might have occurred when the starting crank of an early automobile suddenly reversed with a backfire striking the chauffeur's wrist), or a fall back onto an outstretched hand held in ulnar deviation and supination. Such mechanisms cause the radioscaphocapitate ligament to avulse a large fragment of the radial styloid. This injury frequently results in concomitant lunate dislocation or scapholunate dissociation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H395494673\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive diagnosis of a distal radius fracture is made on the basis of diagnostic imaging studies, typically plain radiographs of the wrist. Radiographs are obtained when the diagnosis is suspected on the basis of a suggestive history, often involving a fall onto an outstretched hand, and examination findings, including pain, tenderness, and possibly deformity at the wrist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H395494681\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism most often responsible for distal radius fractures, fall onto an outstretched hand, is associated with a number of other injuries that should be considered when evaluating patients with acute wrist pain from direct trauma. These injuries include fractures of the scaphoid and other carpal bones, injury to the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) or triangular fibrocartilage complex, and ligamentous injuries, which manifest differently depending upon the involved ligaments (eg, lunate or perilunate dislocation, scapholunate dissociation). Scaphoid injuries are common and often associated with tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82859 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>Although clinical findings may vary somewhat depending upon the injury, there is substantial overlap in the presentations of many of the injuries listed here. Furthermore, two or more injuries may occur simultaneously as a result of the same trauma. Therefore, the only reliable method for distinguishing among injuries is diagnostic imaging, typically starting with plain radiographs of the wrist. The diagnostic approach to patients with acute wrist pain and the diagnosis and management of other major injuries that may be sustained by falling onto an outstretched wrist are discussed separately.

Persistent deficits despite reduction mandate emergent referral to an appropriate surgeon, or transfer if such care is unavailable (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above). Should no emergent conditions exist, immediate reduction is not required. Adequate anesthesia must be obtained prior to reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematoma block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hematoma block, with or without systemic opioids, provides adequate analgesia for reduction of most displaced distal radius fractures. Hematoma blocks are safe and easy to perform. Performance under ultrasound guidance may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>First, the skin over and around the fracture site is prepared with an antiseptic solution (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>). Sterile technique should be maintained throughout the procedure. Next, a 10 mL syringe is filled with 5 to 8 mL of one percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. A 22-gauge needle is attached to this syringe. The clinician then gently palpates the dorsum of the wrist to locate the fracture step-off with one hand, and inserts the needle, also on the dorsal aspect of the wrist, with the other. Often, knowledge of the fracture pattern and displacement from review of the radiographs can assist in determining the optimal placement of the hematoma block. The needle is advanced directly into the fracture site. The clinician draws back continuously on the syringe while advancing the needle. Aspiration is maintained until a flashback of blood confirms placement of the needle tip in the fracture hematoma. The mixture of blood and lidocaine is then injected directly into the fracture site. Some clinicians perform repeated aspirations and reinjections to disperse the anesthetic more completely before removing the needle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Traction/counter-traction</span> is critical to reduction. This can be achieved with or without finger traps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78570\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78570 \">figure 4</a>). The two approaches do not differ in the ultimate alignment attained or in the rate of failure to maintain reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the method used to reduce the fracture, finger traps are a useful adjunct before the procedure is attempted. Traction is applied by attaching the finger traps to the thumb, index, and middle fingers, while keeping the elbow flexed at 90 degrees and the forearm in neutral rotation. Five to 10 pounds (2 to 5 kg) of downward traction is placed on the distal humerus for at least five minutes before any reduction is attempted. This enables muscular relaxation and helps distract the fracture fragments, bringing the radius closer to normal length. It can be helpful to place a towel or sheet under the brachium to disperse the force from the weights hanging from the arm.</p><p>Active reduction can be performed with the patient still in the finger traps. For Colles' type fractures, the examiner's thumbs are placed on the dorsal aspect of the distal fracture fragment, while the fingers are placed on the palmar forearm just proximal to the fracture line. While applying downward axial traction to the proximal fragment, the distal fragment is pushed distally, palmarly, and ulnarly to eliminate the dorsal displacement and radial shortening.</p><p>A sugar tong, reverse-sugar tong, or double sugar tong splint is then applied and molded with the patient still in the finger traps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;, section on 'Sugar tong splints'</a>.) A three-point contact molding technique is used to help hold the reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. For Colles' type fractures, ideal immobilization for the first two weeks consists of 15 degrees of palmar flexion, 10 to 15 degrees of ulnar deviation, and slight pronation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Manual reduction can also be performed without finger traps, with the help of an assistant. The assistant provides counter-traction by holding the elbow. The clinician then supinates the patient's forearm with one hand while applying longitudinal traction to the distal fragment with the other hand and thumb. Next, the fracture is disimpacted by applying dorsal angulation (ie, accentuating the fracture pattern). Finally, the reduction is completed by pronating the forearm and wrist, followed by the application of some ulnar deviation, to correct the radial and dorsal angulation. The fracture is held in this position while a splint is applied and molded in the fashion described immediately above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of distal radius fractures varies according to the patient's health, functional needs, and the injury sustained. Active patients with high functional needs require anatomic reductions, and they often need surgical fixation.</p><p>The most fundamental decision is whether to treat conservatively or surgically. Clinicians should consider such medical factors as bone quality, comorbidities, and functional demand. Fracture characteristics, associated injuries, risk of complications, and clinician experience with fracture management are also relevant. As an example, a 16-year-old skateboarder with a comminuted, displaced, intraarticular fracture requires surgical repair to achieve anatomic alignment; a sedentary 80-year-old with an identical injury needs immobilization and occupational rehabilitation (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Geriatric management'</a> below). Finally, clinicians should inquire about patient preferences and social circumstances.</p><p>Conservative management with closed reduction and immobilization is appropriate for fractures that are reducible by closed manipulation and will remain stable thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A systematic review found insufficient evidence to determine which conservative treatments are most appropriate for common adult distal radius fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Our recommendations below are based upon the limited literature assessing treatment of these fractures and our clinical experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Nondisplaced extra-articular (Frykman types I/II)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are seen three to five days following injury to allow swelling to subside. The clinician should remove the splint, assess neurovascular status, and obtain radiographs of the arm out of the splint to confirm there is no loss of position.</p><p>If the fracture remains nondisplaced or minimally displaced, the clinician applies a short arm cast. The cast should extend from the distal palmar crease to within 5 cm of the antecubital fossa, with the wrist in neutral position. Patients should be seen in follow-up every two to three weeks thereafter until healing is complete. Radiographs are taken at the initial postcasting visit, at two weeks, and then sometime between four and six weeks after injury to confirm proper alignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The patient's wrist and forearm should remain immobilized until there is evidence of radiographic healing or the fracture site is nontender, generally four to six weeks postinjury. At this point, the patient can use a wrist brace in lieu of a cast. Complete healing usually requires six to eight weeks.</p><p>For patients over 60 years of age, the period of immobilization should be kept to a minimum to avoid post-immobilization stiffness. Early transition to a wrist splint may be helpful depending on fracture stability. In one randomized trial, patients treated with a wrist splint were more satisfied and regained function sooner than patients immobilized in a cast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Evidence guiding the appropriate period of fracture immobilization in the geriatric population is lacking. Nevertheless, we think that older patients who meet the following criteria can be removed from their cast and placed in a wrist splint as early as two to three weeks following injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraarticular fracture of the distal radius</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal comminution present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction was NOT necessary</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional demands are few</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk of fall or reinjury is low</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Displaced (Frykman types I-VIII)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once reduction is achieved, we suggest patients remain in the initial sugar tong splint for the following two to three weeks. The U-shaped part of the splint wraps around the elbow, thereby minimizing forearm rotation and maintaining the desired pronation or supination, according to the fracture type. The sugar tong splint also immobilizes the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and splinted patients experience less pain than patients immobilized in a short arm cast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Radiographs are taken in the sugar tong splint on the third, seventh, and twelfth days following reduction. This enables the clinician to detect quickly any loss of position and to assess the acceptability of any postreduction movement or residual deformity. During the first two weeks, the initial splint should be adapted and molded as soft tissue swelling decreases. This is achieved by wrapping the splint tighter with elastic bandages at each follow-up visit. Adequate tightness and molding throughout the early postreduction period reduces the risk of secondary displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>At two to three weeks, the splint is changed to a short arm cast. Wrist immobilization continues in the cast for another three to four weeks. The clinician must take care to maintain three point contact, and to avoid inadequate or excessively bulky padding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At each visit, the clinician should assess fracture site tenderness, swelling, elbow and hand motion, and median nerve function. Radiographs should be obtained every two weeks and studied for signs of dorsal displacement, palmar angulation, and radial shortening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Patients should be immobilized six to eight weeks, until there is evidence of radiographic healing and the fracture site is nontender. At this point, the clinician can remove the cast and place the patient in a wrist brace. Complete healing generally occurs within 8 to 12 weeks. The shortest possible period of immobilization is preferred for older patients; prolonged immobilization can cause joint stiffness and significant loss of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Once the cast is removed, patients should begin active range-of-motion exercises. Physical therapy may be needed to achieve acceptable motion, but most patients require only a single session of instruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Older patients and those with more complicated fractures requiring prolonged immobilization may require more extensive rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294113819\"><span class=\"h2\">Styloid fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, large ulnar styloid fractures (ie, most or all of the styloid is involved) with displaced fragments at the styloid base should be referred to an orthopedic or hand surgeon, as they are associated with an increased risk of distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/16,17,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,35,36</a>]. Fractures of the tip of the ulnar styloid, distal to the DRUJ, are generally considered stable and can be managed conservatively. Radial styloid fractures are often associated with scapholunate injuries and such fractures are generally referred to an orthopedic or hand surgeon for possible surgical management. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p>Isolated nondisplaced fractures of the ulnar styloid that do not involve the DRUJ and are not associated with DRUJ instability are uncommon, but can be managed conservatively in a short arm cast, as is done for nondisplaced radial fractures generally. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Nondisplaced extra-articular (Frykman types I/II)'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Geriatric management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Fracture management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vigorous elderly patients with distal radius fractures should be referred for surgical treatment as indicated. However, many older patients are best served by conservative fracture management and rehabilitation designed to maximize function, despite the presence of significant deformity. One study of patients older than 70 years of age who declined operative repair of their intraarticular distal radius fractures found 89 percent had a good or excellent functional outcome, despite 26 percent having only a fair or poor radiographic result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Another study of elderly patients with moderately displaced Colles' fractures randomized to reduction under Bier block and immobilization or to immobilization alone found no functional difference between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. On average, two-thirds of the dorsal angulation corrected by manipulation was lost by five weeks. The authors concluded that up to 30 degrees of dorsal angulation and 5 mm of radial shortening may be accepted in selected elderly patients.</p><p>The limited utility of fracture reduction among low-functioning geriatric patients was confirmed in another study of 59 patients with a mean age of 82 years. Of 60 fractures treated by closed reduction, 53 ultimately healed with significant deformity. Of 44 dorsally displaced fractures, reduction failed in seven cases initially, and 37 lost reduction during the following weeks of immobilization. The authors concluded that reduction of fractures of the distal radius is of minimal value in old and frail, dependent, or demented patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Osteoporosis also complicates management of older patients with fractures. Optimal clinical results of distal radius fractures have been shown to correlate more closely with bone mineral density than with radiographic parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Osteoporosis contributes to fracture instability. We suggest patients with displaced fractures in osteoporotic bone be referred to an experienced orthopedist. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p>Regardless of management strategy, clinicians should minimize the length of time geriatric patients are immobilized because of the risk of joint stiffness and consequent disability.

A history of a fracture is an important risk factor for a subsequent fracture. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with vertebral, hip, and distal radius fractures do not receive evaluation and treatment for underlying osteoporosis. As a result, these patients frequently suffer additional fractures. Elderly patients with a history of fracture constitute a high-risk group that requires additional evaluation and treatment.

The clinician must perform a careful neurologic examination looking for signs of ACTS at the initial and first follow-up visits, and initial visits following any remanipulation. Weakness or loss of thumb or index finger flexion is the most important finding. Carpal tunnel release is indicated if symptoms progress, with or without reduction, or if surgical fixation is planned. Results are best if release is performed urgently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)

Increasing or constant severe pain and pain elicited by passive extension of the fingers are important findings, but measurement of elevated compartment pressures provides a definitive diagnosis. Emergent fasciotomy is required. A more detailed discussion is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Complications of closed reduction and cast treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Vascular injuries are rare in closed fractures, but injury to the radial or ulnar artery has been reported in high-energy injuries with significant fracture displacement. Perfusion often improves with reduction, but emergent vascular surgery evaluation is necessary for any persistent impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Injuries to carpal bones and carpal ligaments occasionally accompany distal radius fractures, and they should be suspected in patients with persistent wrist pain despite acceptable alignment. A case series of 565 Colles' fractures revealed scaphoid fractures were initially missed in 0.7 percent of cases and intercarpal ligament injuries in 0.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Scaphoid fractures in association with distal radius fractures should be treated with internal fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

If metal skin traps are used, cloth tape can be placed over the fingers before they are hung to reduce skin injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Closed extremity fractures place patients at risk for compartment syndrome, although it is an uncommon complication of distal radius fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Patients with compartment syndrome complain of increasing or constant severe pain and paresthesias. One potential warning sign may be increasing analgesic use. The clinician generally can palpate a firm, tense forearm, and can elicit pain by passive extension of the fingers, thereby stretching the flexor tendons within the forearm compartment. Measurement of elevated compartment pressures enables more accurate diagnosis. Normal pressure is less than 5 mmHg; pressure exceeding 30 mmHg generally warrants emergent fasciotomy. Alterations in capillary refill, distal pulses, and skin color are <strong>NOT</strong> reliable findings. Clinicians should warn patients about the symptoms of compartment syndrome and consider it in patients who complain of severe pain in the days immediately following fracture reduction.</p><p>Reports exist of compartment syndrome following closed reduction under local hematoma block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], but it is a rare complication, and the role of the hematoma block has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis following hematoma block has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Diagnosis is usually made after rupture, and treatment is surgical. EPL rupture is more common with minimally displaced fractures. Tendonitis of the first dorsal compartment and of the extensor carpi ulnaris can also be seen after distal radius fracture. This is usually responsive to steroid injection, but it must be differentiated from triangular fibrocartilage tear or other ulnocarpal ligamentous injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term outcomes/complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of variables related to patient characteristics, fracture type, and radiographic findings predispose patients to the development of osteoarthritis and disability.

Fractures in younger patients are the result of high-energy trauma, often during sports. Fractures in older patients are frequently the result of low-energy trauma to osteoporotic bone. The typical mechanism for distal radius fracture is a Fall Onto an Out-Stretched Hand (FOOSH). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination at the time of injury should include inspection for open fractures and deformity, assessment of wrist motion (if possible), and evaluation for associated injuries, such as scaphoid fracture or scapholunate ligament injury. The wrist may appear normal despite the presence of a fracture. In the days following injury or fracture manipulation, clinicians should pay close attention to neurovascular status (particularly median nerve function) and beware of acute compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is typically made by radiograph. Clinicians should study the standard plain radiographs of the wrist, including anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and oblique views, looking for any loss of normal anatomy, the presence and degree of joint involvement (including both radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints), and the presence of any high-risk features (eg, comminution, articular step-off &gt;2 mm). Abnormal measurements of radial inclination, radial height, palmar tilt, or ulnar variance suggest significant injury. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergent orthopedic referral is required for the following conditions (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Open fractures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute compression neuropathy or compartment syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vascular compromise despite reduction (emergent vascular surgery referral may also be required in this circumstance)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable fractures and those at high risk for complications should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vigorous elderly patients with distal radius fractures should be referred for surgical treatment as indicated. However, many older patients are best served by conservative fracture management (ie, without manipulation or fixation) and rehabilitation designed to maximize function, despite the presence of significant deformity. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Geriatric management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications from distal radius fractures fall into two main categories:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early complications include acute carpal tunnel syndrome, vascular injury, and compartment syndrome.
