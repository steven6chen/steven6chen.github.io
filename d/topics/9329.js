This procedure is performed as part of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, and provides an effective method for assisting fertilization in men with suboptimal semen parameters or who experienced no or low fertilization rates after conventional IVF. </p><p>ICSI was first applied to human gametes in 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; it was first used in cases of fertilization failure after standard IVF or when few sperm cells were available. The first pregnancies were reported in Belgium in 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This technique has consistently demonstrated higher fertilization rates than prior micromanipulation techniques, and produced more embryos with higher implantation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The capacity of ICSI to permit almost any type of spermatozoa to fertilize oocytes has made it the most successful treatment for male factor infertility. In 2008, IVF with ICSI comprised 64.3 percent of ART procedures in the United States, IVF without ICSI comprised 35.5 percent; GIFT, ZIFT, or a combination of procedures accounted for the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The use of ICSI in the United States has increased dramatically since 1995, without a proportionate increase in diagnosis of male-factor infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The use of ICSI for male factor infertility increased from 84 percent in 2003 to 93 percent in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Worldwide, there is geographic variation in the use of ICSI with IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses the indications, techniques, and outcomes for ICSI. Other treatments for male infertility are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough evaluation of the male patient, including semen analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], sperm morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and urology consultation is warranted. Although controversial, some authorities also utilize additional tests such as sperm antibody testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and a wide spectrum of spermatozoa function tests ranging from, but not limited to, hamster-spermatozoa penetration assay, hemi-zona assay, mannose binding assay, hypo-osmotic swelling test, and acrosome reaction assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>] for identifying couples at risk for reduced or no fertilization with conventional IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/13,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21-25</a>]. In males with severe oligospermia or azoospermia, additional testing may be recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-male-with-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the male with infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common genetic factors associated with male infertility are cystic fibrosis gene mutations (associated with congenital absence of the vas deferens), structural chromosomal abnormalities (eg, aneuploidy, inversion, translocation) associated with impaired testicular function, and Y chromosome microdeletions (associated with impaired spermatogenesis). Cystic fibrosis is associated with a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Men who carry this gene may not have the classic clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;, section on 'Sperm transport disorders'</a>.) </p><p>Structural chromosomal abnormalities in peripheral lymphocytes are observed in 10 to 15 percent of azoospermic men, 5 percent of oligospermic men, and less than 1 percent of normospermic men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The partners of these men are at increased risk of miscarriage and progeny are at increased risk of congenital anomalies. </p><p>Detectable microdeletions of the Y chromosome are found by polymerase chain reaction in 10 to 15 percent of men with azoospermia or severe oligospermia. This is probably an underestimate since microdeletions that are nondetectable by current techniques likely exist. Sons of men with microdeletions will inherit the microdeletion and thus be at risk for infertility. The genetics of male infertility is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-male-with-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the male with infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility#H65383826\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;, section on 'Y chromosome and related defects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility#H1223092651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;, section on 'Autosomal and X chromosome defects'</a>.)</p><p>Some guidelines recommend systematically screening men with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia for chromosomal abnormalities, including Y chromosome microdeletions, which may be present in lymphocytes or detected only in sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Affected men are counseled about the risk of inherited spermatogenesis failure in male offspring and options such as sex selection and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that karyotyping be offered to men who have nonobstructive azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (defined as less than 5 to 10 million <span class=\"nowrap\">sperm/mL)</span> prior to performing ICSI with their sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Neither the definition of severe oligozoospermia nor the recommendation for screening severely oligozoospermic men is consistent worldwide. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ICSI is indicated primarily for treatment of male factor infertility. It may also be useful in the following clinical situations: failed fertilization in a prior IVF cycle, preimplantation genetic testing of embryos, fertilization of previously cryopreserved oocytes and in vitro maturation of oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;</a>). ICSI is also used for treatment of borderline semen parameters and selected types of female infertility, such as some morphologic anomalies of oocytes and anomalies of the zona pellucida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In couples with male factor infertility, fertilization rates of up to 80 percent and clinical pregnancy rates of up to 45 percent are observed with ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, ICSI use in couples without male factor infertility or one of the indications listed above is less effective than conventional IVF and is not advised. A retrospective cohort study of 317,996 ICSI cycles in couples without male factor infertility reported lower rates of implantation (23 versus 25 percent) and livebirth (36.5 versus 39.2 percent) compared with conventional IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Other potential uses for ICSI include HIV discordant couples (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of assisted reproduction in HIV- and hepatitis-infected couples&quot;</a>) and IVF involving in vitro matured oocytes, previously cryopreserved oocytes, or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (to ensure absence of extraneous DNA contamination from other sperm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The Practice Committees of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) concluded that existing evidence does not support use of ICSI as a routine procedure with IVF or to improve clinical pregnancy rates in couples with unexplained infertility, low oocyte yield, or advanced maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, further research is needed because limited evidence suggests that ICSI improves fertilization rates and reduces total failed fertilization compared with conventional insemination in couples with well-defined unexplained infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Alternatives to ICSI have not been studied extensively. A systematic review in couples with moderate male infertility found that the overall fertilization rate was significantly higher after ICSI than after standard IVF (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.5; nine trials), but suggested that similar fertilization rates could be achieved if high insemination concentration IVF were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Pregnancy rates were not reported. Thus, high insemination IVF may be a reasonable alternative to ICSI in patients with moderate (not severe) male factor infertility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SPERM RETRIEVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sperm are typically retrieved from ejaculated semen. Surgical retrieval of spermatozoa from the testicles or reproductive tract in combination with ICSI is an effective treatment for men with obstructive or nonobstructive azoospermia, ejaculatory dysfunction, or complications from cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Limited microsurgical skills are needed to retrieve epididymal sperm microsurgically (microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration [MESA]) or percutaneously (PESA), or to obtain testicular sperm from biopsy (testicular sperm extraction [TESE]) or fine-needle aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. TESE has been successful in obtaining sperm in over 50 percent of patients with nonobstructive azoospermia, including patients with Klinefelter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Sperm retrieval rates are higher in Klinefelter syndrome patients with serum testosterone near the reference range (&gt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend any one sperm retrieval technique over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In terms of sperm source, the fertilization, pregnancy, and live birth rates are equivalent with testicular or epididymal sperm retrieval in men with obstructive azoospermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; however, epididymal aspiration is preferred, when possible, because of a lower risk of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Sperm can be obtained from testicular tissue, even in cases of spermatogenic arrest or Sertoli cells only syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Repeated surgical retrieval of spermatozoa can be avoided by standard cryopreservation if sufficient numbers of spermatozoa are obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/33,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,42</a>], or by cryopreservation in an empty human zona pellucida if only very few or even single spermatozoon are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In a 2014 meta-analysis of comparative studies of ICSI in men with azoospermia due to spermatogenic dysfunction, there was no statistical difference between the use of fresh versus cryopreserved-thawed testicular sperm in fertilization or clinical pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although live births of healthy newborns have been achieved, there are important genetic implications of these procedures. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy and pediatric outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>The fertilization rate after ICSI with testicular spermatozoa in nonobstructive azoospermia is significantly lower than in obstructive azoospermia, but pregnancy and embryo implantation rates appear to be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. The clinical pregnancy rate of the partners of vasectomized men who have undergone TESE followed by ICSI appears to be reduced relative to men with obstructive azoospermia from other etiologies (9 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This reduction in pregnancy rate was observed when the vasectomy occurred &ge;10 years prior to sperm retrieval and may be related to poorer sperm quality remote from vasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. The quality of post-vasectomy sperm may be compromised such that they are less capable of achieving a pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SPERMATOZOA SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spermatozoa preparation skills and the ability to select a normal viable spermatozoa for injection are important factors in the success of ICSI. They play a key role because the direct injection of spermatozoa into the oocyte bypasses natural selection, thus it could inadvertently introduce a defective paternal genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. If the spermatozoa used for ICSI have outwardly normal morphology and motility, the probability of fertilization and subsequent embryo development is almost guaranteed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Motility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired motility is the semen parameter most associated with a reduction in ICSI fertilization rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. Since the human embryo derives its centriolar apparatus and mitotic potential from the spermatozoa, the use of spermatozoa with a damaged or abnormal centriole could result in embryos with severe cleavage arrest or irregular cleavage patterns. Immotile spermatozoa and poorly motile spermatozoa with no forward progression are more likely to have defective centrosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>Recovery of spermatozoa from density gradients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>] and treatment with 2-deoxyadenosine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> to stimulate spermatozoa motility have been used to identify live spermatozoa in semen with variable motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/4,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,59</a>]. If spermatozoa remain immotile after treatment and processing, Eosin-Nigrosin staining is beneficial in determining viability of the spermatozoa preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and the hypo-osmotic swelling test can be used as a means to select viable spermatozoa from an immobile population at the time of ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sperm DNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developing methods to identify, select, and isolate sperm with undamaged DNA is important since high levels of DNA damage in spermatozoa are associated with fertilization impairment and failure of embryo development after ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. Selecting spermatozoa based on fine morphological assessments (eg, normal nuclear material) may enhance embryo survival and pregnancy outcome in couples with male infertility for whom ICSI with unselected sperm injection has failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Zona pellucida binding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of sperm for ICSI by the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> binding method is based on the relationship between sperm receptors for zona pellucida and hyaluronic acid and the ability of competent mature sperm to attach themselves to hyaluronic acid through specific receptors found on the sperm plasma membrane. Sperm with diminished-maturity, increased levels of chromosomal aberrations, or failed spermatogenetic membrane remodeling, will not bind to hyaluronic acid. Embryologists select sperm by choosing the most morphologically normal looking sperm by eye or by nuclear features detected by specialized microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The selection of sperm bound to hyaluronic acid for ICSI may facilitate the selection of individual mature sperm with low levels of chromosomal aneuploidies and thus lower rates of miscarriage after ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, limited evidence from a 2014 meta-analysis of two randomized trials suggested that sperm selection with hyaluronic acid binding does not result in improved pregnancy rates, live birth rates, or lower miscarriage rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique for ICSI involves the use of sophisticated instruments and requires a trained embryologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Policies/procedures</span> should protect gametes from temperature and pH variations and fluctuations, which may disrupt spindles and contribute to abnormal chromosome distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inverted microscope with high quality optics (eg, Nomarski or Hoffman) should be used for the most accurate visualization of gametes and microtools, thereby decreasing oocyte damage while optimizing fertilization rates. A sophisticated heated optical system, such as polarization microscopy, can be used to monitor spindle position during injection and reduce spindle damage during the ICSI procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. The inverted microscope should be located on an antivibration table in a quiet area of the lab and be fitted with at least a stage warmer, high precision micromanipulators, and microsyringe injection systems operated hydraulically by air or oil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>]. Micromanipulators offer the capability to manipulate gametes with precise movements at microscopic levels. Fabrication of microtools requires a microforge, pipette puller and microgrinder, although most laboratories purchase high quality precision ready-made microtools from different manufacturers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Oocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oocytes are obtained from the female partner in the same manner as in conventional IVF procedures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a>). Several studies have suggested that factors such as maternal age and oocyte quality and quantity have a greater impact upon ICSI success than the severity of semen abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/54,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,76,77</a>]. Oocytes derived from poor quality stimulations (poor responders, hyperresponders) or exhibiting cytoplasmic abnormalities demonstrate higher degeneration rates, abnormal fertilization rates, and pregnancy loss rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>].</p><p>The oocytes are denuded of cumulus-coronal cells by exposure to hyaluronidase, and residual cells are gently aspirated with a finely pulled pipette. Excessive exposure to hyaluronidase or aggressive manipulation of oocytes to remove cells may parthenogenetically activate oocytes or reposition the first polar body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>]. The oocytes are graded morphologically and only oocytes at metaphase II exhibiting a distinct extruded first polar body are used for injection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An injection pipette containing an immobilized spermatozoon is gently pushed through the zona pellucida and through the oolemma into the center of the oocyte. The spermatozoa should be delivered with the smallest possible amount of medium. Negative pressure is then used to break the oolemma, followed by gentle aspiration of the cytoplasm. The effects of different methods of depositing sperm, breaking the oolemma, and aspirating cytoplasm for oocyte activation on fertilization and embryo development rates are an active area of investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-86</a>]. Laser-assisted ICSI is an innovative approach that has been used in patients with a history of poor ICSI outcome and with limited metaphase II oocytes. This technique is less traumatic to the oocytes during the ICSI procedure and has resulted in improved fertilization rates and embryo quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p>A new ICSI injection technology using piezo-driven pipettes has been successfully applied in a number of mammalian species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Damage to the oocyte is greatly reduced because the injector uses ultrasonic cutting forces, rather than piercing forces, to penetrate the oolemma, thus there is almost no deformation of the oocyte during the injection. This technique results in comparably high survival and success rates.</p><p>After injection, the oocytes are cultured according to standard laboratory protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FERTILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fertilization rate following ICSI is approximately 50 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/4,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,89</a>]. Although ICSI does not guarantee fertilization, the incidence of complete fertilization failure is low and usually occurs in cycles with low oocyte yield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Failure of fertilization is typically not due to nonplacement or ejection of the spermatozoa from the oocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/85,86,90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86,90,91</a>]. It may be caused by the failure of the oocytes to undergo activation, which is usually related to poor oocyte quality or sperm nonviability. Cytoplasmic maturation and fertilization rates can be enhanced by extending the oocyte preincubation time after retrieval and prior to ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>], by assisted oocyte activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>], and by avoiding use of fresh ejaculates with globozoospermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>] or no motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], and testicular sperm with no or partial motility. The fertilization procedure can cause oocyte damage and degeneration in 8 to 20 percent of procedures; each laboratory should analyze their rate to determine if technical or stimulation problems exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/78-80,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80,86</a>].</p><p>ICSI outcomes are also highly dependent upon the technical expertise of the embryologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pronucleus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of pronuclear formation after ICSI is necessary to distinguish and separate abnormally fertilized oocytes from normally fertilized oocytes, which possess two pronuclei, male and female, and extruded first and second polar bodies. Timing of pronuclear assessment may need to be altered since pronuclear formation may be advanced in ICSI fertilized oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Polyspermia should not be an issue since only one spermatozoon is introduced into the oocyte during injection.</p><p>Monospermic digynic (tripronuclear) and single pronucleate oocytes may occur more frequently with ICSI. For this reason, verification of the number of polar bodies at the time of fertilization assessment is essential. Tripronuclear oocytes with one polar body result from the nonextrusion of the second polar body and may be a consequence of damage or disruption to the spindle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/71,83,99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,83,99,100</a>]. Pronuclear oocytes are not the result of asynchronous pronuclear development, but rather a failure of sperm to decondense fully and form the male pronucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. </p><p>Any abnormally fertilized oocyte derived from ICSI should be discarded and not considered for embryo transfer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYO QUALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When embryo gross morphology and grades were assessed after ICSI, precompaction embryo quality did not seem to be adversely affected by the injection procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. However, precompaction embryonic implantation rates for ICSI-derived embryos are lower than embryos derived from conventional in vitro insemination, which suggests ICSI-derived embryos have a diminished implantation potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/82,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,104</a>]. This diminished potential may be due to paternal factors or the invasive nature of the ICSI technique. It does not typically manifest until late cleavage, compaction, or blastocyst stage of development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/51,70-72,83,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,70-72,83,104</a>]. Therefore, blastocyst rather than cleavage-stage transfer may enhance embryo selection.</p><p>Male factor infertility significantly reduces blastocyst production; it is not clear whether this is caused by the paternal genome or the ICSI technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/104-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">104-109</a>]. In one study, the insemination method had no impact on blastocyst production, indicating that the ICSI technique was not responsible for the decreased blastocyst production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Data from several other studies have shown that blastocyst formation was significantly decreased in embryos derived from ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/104,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,110</a>]. Although production of blastocysts appears to be negatively affected by paternal or ICSI factors, most studies demonstrated equivalent pregnancy and implantation rates between blastocysts derived from ICSI and those from conventional insemination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYOPRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies suggested a negative impact of ICSI upon cryosurvival, implantation, and ongoing pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/111-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-114</a>]; however, subsequent data from well-established programs have shown cryopreserved embryo survival (greater than 70 percent) and implantation potential (greater than 10 percent) can be highly successful regardless of the origin of sperm, method of insemination, or cryopreservation stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/115-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">115-118</a>].</p><p>Little is known about the impact of ICSI upon cryosurvival and implantation potential of blastocysts derived from ICSI insemination.

ICSI patients had a significantly higher rate of inherited structural karyotype anomalies (1.4 versus 0.3 to 0.4 percent in prenatal tests in the general population; P &lt;0.001), which appeared to be related to a higher rate of l chromosomal anomalies in the fathers. There was no evidence of a higher risk of post-zygotic events leading to a higher proportion of chromosomal mosaicism from the ICSI procedure. Given these findings, couples should be informed of the risk of an abnormal fetal karyotype due to paternally inherited chromosomal abnormalities, the relatively benign phenotype of some of these chromosomal anomalies, and the risks associated with invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures so that they may make an informed choice about prenatal testing.</p><p>Alternatively, if pretreatment genetic screening was performed to identify men with chromosomal abnormalities, then affected men could be counseled about the risks in their offspring and unaffected men could be reassured. Abnormalities of the Y chromosome would only affect male offspring; these couples could be offered options such as sex selection, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or prenatal diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Chromosomal abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>As discussed above, sons of men with microdeletions will inherit the microdeletion and thus be at risk for infertility.

The best documented concern is for an increased risk of hypospadias and imprinting disorders, but the evidence is still inadequate to conclude that such a relationship exists. More reliable data are needed. Both study and control children should be examined in the same way and at the same age by blinded examiners using the same definitions of <span class=\"nowrap\">major/minor</span> birth defects and the data should be corrected for confounders, such as maternal age, plurality, and chromosomal abnormalities.

These concerns have been validated as both de novo sex and autosomal chromosome aberrations appear to increase after ICSI.</p><p>Subfertile men (and women) are more likely than fertile men to have chromosomal abnormalities (eg, aneuploidies, structural abnormalities, gene mutations, microdeletions) that may contribute to their subfertility and may be passed to their offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection/abstract/27,145-148\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,145-148</a>].
