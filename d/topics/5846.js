Some brain conditions can cause a person's brain wave patterns to be abnormal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391245\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order an EEG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order an EEG to diagnose a brain condition or get more information about a known brain condition. You might have an EEG if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely. An EEG can give your doctor information about your seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a brain tumor, brain injury, sleep problems, or memory problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are going to have brain surgery</p><p/><p>A doctor might also order an EEG to check the brain activity of a person in a coma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391259\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for an EEG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To prepare for an EEG, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hair the night before your EEG with shampoo only. Don't put any conditioner, cream, or gel in your hair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not eat or drink anything with caffeine in it for 8 hours beforehand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow your doctor's instructions about taking your medicines. You might need to take your usual medicines and doses. Or you might need to change your medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow your doctor's instructions about sleep. You might need to stay awake the night before your EEG. If you do, you will need to stay awake without drinking coffee or energy drinks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391274\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during an EEG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An EEG can take place in a lab, office, or hospital.</p><p>At the start of the EEG, a technician will stick electrodes onto your scalp using paste (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55691 \">figure 1</a>). Some people wear a special cap with electrodes on it instead of having electrodes put on their scalp. Wires run from the electrodes to a computer that will record your brain activity.</p><p>After the electrodes are in place, you will lie on a bed or lean back in a chair. Your doctor might give you medicine to make you sleepy. You will need to stay still and close your eyes. The technician will ask you to do different things at different times during the EEG. He or she might have you look at a flashing light, or breathe in and out deeply and quickly.</p><p>An EEG usually takes about 20 minutes. Some EEGs last longer. People can have an EEG for a few hours or overnight. In some cases, a video camera will record them during their EEG. Some people have an &quot;ambulatory EEG.&quot; After the electrodes are in place, they go home. The EEG records their brain waves for a few days while they do their usual activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391289\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after an EEG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an EEG, the technician will remove the electrodes or the cap. Most people can go about their usual activities. But if your doctor gave you medicine to make you sleepy, you will feel sleepy for a while. In that case, you should have another person drive you home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391304\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of an EEG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There aren't usually any downsides to having an EEG. The procedure is painless. An EEG only gets information from your brain. It does not do anything to your brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391319\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about the results?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should know that an EEG doesn't always give a doctor helpful information. That's because an EEG records brain activity only for a short time.</p><p>People can have a normal EEG result even if they have seizures or another brain condition. Your doctor will use your EEG results along with your exam and other results to diagnose or manage your condition. If your doctor thinks that another EEG would be helpful, he or she might have you do an EEG that lasts longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391334\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy and pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
