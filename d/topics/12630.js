However, such procedures exchange the adverse effects of native disease for prosthesis-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-patients-with-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The frequency of various complications depends upon the valve type and position, and other clinical risk factors. Complications include embolic events, bleeding, valve obstruction (due to thrombosis or pannus), infective endocarditis, structural deterioration (particularly for bioprosthetic valves), paravalvular regurgitation, hemolytic anemia, and prosthesis-patient mismatch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of patients with prosthetic valves, including monitoring for complications, is reviewed here.

Repeat evaluation with echocardiography should be performed any time there is a change in clinical status or examination findings. (See <a href=\"#H2932533487\" class=\"local\">'Infective endocarditis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562032156\"><span class=\"h2\">Schedule of follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main components of follow-up are history, physical examination, and echocardiography. We suggest the following approach to evaluation after prosthetic valve implantation, largely based on the 2014 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-patients-with-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first outpatient visit at six weeks (or earlier if an issue was identified at discharge such as heart failure or pericardial effusion or if new symptoms or signs arise) to three months after valve implantation is aimed at assessing function of the prosthetic valve and looking for signs of infection, conduction disturbance, or myocardial infarction. The evaluation should include an interval history, physical examination, appropriate blood tests (complete blood count, creatinine, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and International Normalized Ratio if indicated), and a transthoracic echocardiogram. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may be obtained, if indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A baseline echocardiogram is essential since it enables assessment of the effects of surgery on cardiac remodeling, and serves as a basis for later comparison, particularly for valvular hemodynamics obtained with Doppler. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up clinical evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE; and transesophageal echocardiography [TEE] as needed) should be performed any time there is a change in clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of valve dysfunction, or, in patients with mechanical valves, an interruption in effective anticoagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine follow-up visits in asymptomatic patients with normal cardiac function should occur yearly. The evaluation should include a complete history and physical examination; other tests are performed as indicated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In asymptomatic patients with mechanical valves without evidence of left ventricular or valve dysfunction, routine annual echocardiography is <strong>not</strong> indicated. However, follow-up echocardiography may be indicated for other concurrent conditions such as left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, or other valve dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a surgically implanted bioprosthetic valve, an annual TTE is reasonable after the first 10 years, even in the absence of change in clinical symptoms or signs. Earlier surveillance is suggested for selected patients at risk for early bioprosthetic valve degeneration, including patients with hyperparathyroidism (including patients with kidney disease), systemic inflammatory disease, and patients &lt;60 years old. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For transcatheter aortic and pulmonic bioprosthetic valves, we recommend annual echocardiography, as the long-term durability of these valves has not yet been established. In addition, many patients are enrolled in mandated valve registries that require annual imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of therapy for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous pulmonic valve implantation&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition to routine monitoring of patients with prosthetic heart valves, periodic echocardiography is frequently indicated in patients with prosthetic valves for residual cardiac abnormalities, such as left ventricular dilation or systolic dysfunction, abnormalities of other valves, and persistent pulmonary hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performing a history and physical examination in patients with prosthetic heart valve, particular attention should be given to the following signs and symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subtle symptoms of heart failure or neurologic events can be clues to serious valve-related complications. In a patient with a prosthetic heart valve, new symptoms or signs should be carefully considered to determine if they may be caused by a valve complication. The physical findings may identify signs of embolic events suggested by the history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal auscultatory findings may be suggestive of valvular abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70856 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-patients-with-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. With a mechanical valve, absence or blunting of typical opening and closing sounds may be suggestive of valve thrombosis. With both mechanical and biological valves, a new murmur suggests prosthetic valve stenosis, regurgitation, or a paravalvular leak. Interpretation of auscultatory findings in patients with prosthetic heart valves is difficult even for experienced clinicians. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, a baseline echocardiogram is recommended in all patients at their first postoperative follow-up visit. This study is used to document the stability of the valve, the presence and extent of valvular or paravalvular regurgitation, and the transvalvular pressure gradients. Methods to evaluate prosthetic valve function with Doppler echocardiography are detailed in the guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-patients-with-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The postoperative baseline echocardiogram also establishes whether there are concurrent conditions (left ventricular dysfunction, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension, or other valve involvement) that might warrant more frequent imaging than needed for monitoring the prosthetic valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of prosthetic heart valves&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TTE is generally used for the baseline study; TEE may be indicated in select patients to assess valve dysfunction (eg, those with a suspected paravalvular leak from a mitral prosthesis), or patients with a suspected cardiac source of embolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67281%7ECARD%2F68507%7ECARD%2F75409\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67281 graphicRef68507 graphicRef75409 \">movie 1A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-patients-with-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Doppler-derived velocities and derived parameters are essential in the noninvasive evaluation of prosthetic valve function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-patients-with-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One study, for example, found that application of the continuity equation and calculation of valve resistance provided a reliable method to distinguish whether a high velocity and gradient across a St. Jude aortic valve was secondary to obstruction or increased flow (as with paravalvular aortic regurgitation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-patients-with-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Parameters that differentiated stenotic from regurgitant and normal valves were effective orifice area, Doppler velocity index, and valve resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other studies are rarely indicated in patients with no symptoms related to the prosthetic heart valve and no abnormal physical exam findings.

Patient education should include instruction regarding the risk of infective endocarditis, the importance of optimal dental hygiene and regular dental care, the need for endocarditis prophylaxis at the time of dental procedures, and the importance of seeking medical attention, including blood cultures promptly if symptoms of endocarditis develop. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended in the setting of procedures likely to result in bacteremia with a microorganism that has the potential ability to cause endocarditis.

These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &ldquo;patient info&rdquo; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-valves-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Prosthetic valves (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13876774\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of serial follow-up of patients with prosthetic valves include identification of changes in clinical status, management of antithrombotic therapy, monitoring for complications, identification of changes in valve function, and provision of patient education. (See <a href=\"#H1332495029\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should receive education reinforcing the importance of seeking prompt medical attention for any new sign or symptom that might be related to a valve complication such as fever, change in mechanical valve clicks, change in exercise tolerance, stroke symptoms, palpitations, or chest pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious complications of prosthetic heart valves occur at the rate of approximately 3 percent per year. The complications include thromboembolism, bleeding (particularly in patients receiving anticoagulation), prosthetic heart valve obstruction (caused by valve thrombosis, pannus formation, bioprosthetic valve fibrosis, prosthesis-patient mismatch, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcification), valvular and paravalvular regurgitation, infective endocarditis, and prosthesis related hemolysis. (See <a href=\"#H1332495540\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithrombotic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (or other vitamin K antagonist) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is recommended in patients with prosthetic heart valves to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolic events. Recommendations for therapy vary with the type of valve (the risk of thrombosis is much greater with mechanical valves), the site of valve replacement (the risk is greater with mitral than aortic valves), and the presence or absence of thrombotic risk factors, including atrial fibrillation. Specific recommendations apply to management of antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy and during invasive procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1332494944\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for prosthetic heart valves: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients receiving a prosthetic heart valve, a baseline echocardiogram is recommended at first postoperative follow-up visit six weeks to three months after prosthetic valve implantation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Serial follow-up'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic patients with mechanical valves without evidence of left ventricular or valve dysfunction, routine annual echocardiography is <strong>not</strong> indicated. Surgical bioprosthetic valves should be imaged annually starting 10 years after implantation with earlier evaluation in those at risk of more rapid valve deterioration. Transcatheter bioprosthetic valves should be imaged annually. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat evaluation with echocardiography should be performed any time there is a change in clinical status or examination findings. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Serial follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with prosthetic valves are among those at highest risk of an adverse outcome from infective endocarditis and thus optimal dental care is essential, and antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended in the setting of procedures likely to result in bacteremia with a microorganism that has the potential ability to cause endocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolysis associated with prosthetic heart valves is more common with mechanical than bioprosthetic valves. It is usually mild and subclinical but is severe in certain patients with paravalvular regurgitation. (See <a href=\"#H1314760480\" class=\"local\">'Hemolytic anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular moderate exercise to maintain cardiovascular fitness is encouraged in patients with prosthetic valves. Recommendations for competitive sports vary depending upon valve type and need for anticoagulation. All patients treated with anticoagulation should not participate in sports associated with risk of bodily contact or other types of trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105803 \">table 2</a>).
