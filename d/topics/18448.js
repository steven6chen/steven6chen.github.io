Referral to an ophthalmology specialist is indicated for the diagnosis and management of most patients with symptoms suggesting uveal tract inflammation.</p><p>The definition of uveitis and its subsets; causes of uveitis and differential diagnosis of underlying conditions; clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of uveitis; and the role of the non-ophthalmologist in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with uveitis are described here. The treatment of uveitis is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uveitis is characterized by inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle portion of the eye; the anterior portion of the uvea includes the iris and ciliary body, and the posterior portion of the uvea is known as the choroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>). The term derives from the Latin word for &quot;grape,&quot; since anatomists once thought that the peeling of the outside of the eye left a grape-like structure beneath.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of the anterior uveal tract, characterized by the presence of leukocytes in the anterior chamber of the eye, is called anterior uveitis and is synonymous with iritis. When the adjacent ciliary body is also inflamed, the process is known as iridocyclitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of leukocytes in the vitreous humor and evidence of active chorioretinal inflammation are diagnostic of intermediate uveitis and posterior uveitis, respectively. Terms used to describe forms of uveitis posterior to the lens include vitritis, intermediate uveitis, pars planitis, choroiditis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, and retinochoroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panuveitis is defined as simultaneous inflammation in the anterior chamber, vitreous humor, and retina or choroid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uveitis frequently occurs in association with other systemic medical conditions, especially infections and inflammatory diseases, but may occur as an isolated process. Individual forms of uveitis may be distinguished on the basis of location within the eye (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above); onset, symmetry and continuity of inflammation; associated complications (see <a href=\"#H84697294\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below); and distribution of cells along the corneal endothelium. The latter changes are known as keratic precipitates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71161 \">picture 1</a>). Both the size and distribution of keratic precipitates are helpful in the differential diagnosis of the underlying cause. The diversity of keratic precipitates is especially appreciated by magnified images obtained with confocal microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Uveitis may be divided into four major subsets based upon the etiology of the inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61247%7ERHEUM%2F75844%7ERHEUM%2F55902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61247 graphicRef75844 graphicRef55902 \">table 1A-C</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infectious causes'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic immune-mediated disease, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systemic inflammatory diseases (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Systemic inflammatory diseases'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other immune-related conditions (see <a href=\"#H56535411\" class=\"local\">'Drugs and hypersensitivity reactions'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syndromes confined primarily to the eye (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Uveitis syndromes restricted to the eye'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Approximately 40 percent of patients have uveitis associated with a systemic immune-mediated disease in the author's referral population; the proportion of patients with each type of uveitis in an unselected general population is uncertain and varies between populations. Approximately 30 percent of patients with uveitis do not fit into any well-defined diagnostic category and are usually labeled as having idiopathic uveitis.</p><p>A genetic predisposition may contribute to the development of uveitis. For example, birdshot retinochoroidopathy is strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A29, and acute anterior uveitis is associated with HLA-B27. Epidemiologic data have also shown differences in incidence among different ethnicities, further supporting a role for genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A few studies have also suggested that cigarette smoking may be associated with an increased risk of uveitis and with increased severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infectious causes of uveitis include bacterial and spirochetal diseases, viral diseases, fungal infections, and parasitic infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61247 \">table 1A</a>). These infections generally have distinctive presentations and are likely to affect different populations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Herpes virus</strong> &ndash; Both herpes simplex and herpes zoster can cause a keratouveitis, which is usually unilateral. Keratouveitis is an inflammation of the cornea along with uveitis that is primarily anterior. The presence of cutaneous vesicles, characteristic corneal changes, reduced corneal sensation, elevated intraocular pressure, and iris atrophy may be clues to the diagnosis. Both herpes simplex and zoster can also cause a retinitis known as acute retinal necrosis. This is a rare but treatable cause of visual loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;, section on 'Ocular infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Herpes zoster ophthalmicus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytomegalovirus</strong> &ndash; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a cause for uveitis in adults is found almost exclusively in the immunocompromised host, especially patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and extremely low CD4 counts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60120 \">picture 2</a>). Uveitis (CMV retinitis) is the most common serious ocular complication of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CMV infection is also an uncommon cause of anterior uveitis in patients, most of whom are Asian, who are not immunocompromised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent adults&quot;, section on 'Ocular manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxoplasmosis</strong> &ndash; Toxoplasmosis is a surprisingly common cause of uveitis in the normal host. In many instances, it is presumed to be a reactivation of a congenitally acquired infection. It is suspected on the basis of a typical chorioretinal lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69853 \">picture 3</a>); the diagnosis is supported by serology. Serologic evidence for previous infection by toxoplasmosis is extremely common in the healthy United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most chorioretinal scarring from toxoplasmosis is due to infection during gestation, but scarring is increasingly recognized as a result of recent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ocular toxoplasmosis can affect both normal and immunocompromised hosts but is far more common in immunocompetent patients, in contrast to central nervous system toxoplasmosis, which is seen almost exclusively in the immune-compromised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Syphilis</strong> &ndash; Syphilis accounts for less than 1 percent of patients with uveitis in most large series. It may present in a variety of forms, including posterior uveitis, such as a chorioretinitis or retinal vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59760\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59760 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is critical to recognize syphilis because of its important therapeutic implications.

It should be considered in the differential diagnosis when the uveitis worsens despite glucocorticoid therapy. Additional factors that raise suspicion for this diagnosis are active tuberculosis elsewhere in the body, cachexia, homelessness, a history of incarceration, a granulomatous appearance for the ocular inflammation, or immunosuppression. In some geographic areas such as Saudi Arabia, tuberculosis is considered a common cause of uveitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-and-the-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis and the eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cat-scratch disease</strong> &ndash; Cat scratch disease is increasingly recognized as a cause of uveitis that is typically unilateral. Although the uveitis associated with cat scratch disease can have a variable presentation, a macular star and optic nerve edema are especially characteristic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69294\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69294 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Uveitis is a common feature of this viral disease and may be asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection#H26598549\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of West Nile virus infection&quot;, section on 'Ocular manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ebola virus disease</strong> &ndash; The occurrence of uveitis during the convalescent phase of Ebola virus disease has been reported in four patients in one case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as well as another patient in a separate case report in which viable virus was obtained from the aqueous humor of the affected eye nine weeks after clearance of viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a study of 277 survivors of Ebola in Sierra Leone, 60 percent had new ocular symptoms and 18 percent were diagnosed with uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In 2015, during an epidemic outbreak of this infection, 29 infants with microcephaly underwent detailed eye examinations at a tertiary center in Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Twenty-three of the 29 mothers had symptoms consistent with Zika exposure during pregnancy. Ten of the 29 infants had ocular abnormalities such as chorioretinal atrophy, pigmentary mottling of the retina, or optic nerve disease. These findings are consistent with Zika exposure in utero resulting in scarring of the uveal tract. Both anterior and posterior uveitis have also been reported as a component of active infection with Zika in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Uveitis is only rarely due to a reaction to a medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic inflammatory diseases</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spondyloarthritis</strong> &ndash; Spondyloarthritides, such as ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis, are the most common systemic immune disorders associated with uveitis in North America and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Twenty to 40 percent of patients with either of these HLA-B27-related disorders develop the sudden onset of anterior uveitis. When it occurs, uveitis is often the manifestation to suggest the diagnosis of the systemic illness. As an example, one study found that 40 percent of patients presenting to an ophthalmology emergency department for acute anterior uveitis without a prior diagnosis had a form of SpA as the underlying cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Uveitis in association with SpA is twice as common in males as in females.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Uveitis in association with SpA is typically unilateral and tends to resolve within three months of its onset. Recurrences are common and can occur in the contralateral eye. The prognosis for this form of uveitis is generally excellent.

A strong association was seen between patients with recurrent acute anterior uveitis and the presence of inflammation at the tendon or ligament insertion (enthesitis) demonstrated by ultrasound, despite the absence of clinical symptoms of spondyloarthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sarcoidosis</strong> &ndash; Sarcoidosis accounts for a significant percentage of patients with uveitis in most series from referral centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of patients develop eye disease as their initial presentation of sarcoid. The eye disease can take on many forms, including uveitis, dry eyes, optic neuritis, lid inflammation, or orbital disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The onset of uveitis is usually between the ages of two and eight and, in the majority of patients, can be asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The uveitis associated with JIA is usually bilateral, insidious in onset, chronic in duration, and anterior. The eye disease is commonly associated with complications such as band keratopathy, posterior synechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52468\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52468 \">picture 7</a>), cataract formation, and glaucoma.

Patients may experience bilateral, recurrent, or chronic uveitis. Because interstitial nephritis and uveitis can also occur together in sarcoidosis and in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, patients with TINU syndrome should be evaluated for these disorders as well.

VKH is presumably an autoimmune disease that is manifested by bilateral posterior uveitis with characteristic fluid accumulation beneath the retina, leading to retinal elevation and detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. It often presents as a panuveitis. The diagnosis of VKH is based upon the clinical presentation; there are no serologic tests or specific histological changes. Patients with VKH may also develop vitiligo, poliosis (loss of color from a patch of hair), sterile meningitis, alopecia, and eighth cranial nerve disease. The disease is common among Hispanic populations in addition to Asians.

Answering yes to either of the first two questions (ie, back pain or joint pain), followed by testing that is positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, had high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of SpA in patients with acute, unilateral anterior uveitis of previously unknown etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. SpA was identified by this strategy in about 40 percent of these patients.

A diagnosis of SpA could also be made in about 30 percent of patients who were HLA-B27-negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history should also include questions regarding risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Patients with HIV infection are at increased risk for several infectious causes of uveitis, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

In patients in whom the history and examination does suggest a possible cause, diagnostic testing, which is focused upon confirming or excluding the suspected etiology, is warranted for confirmation of the specific diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H55582701\" class=\"local\">'History and examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H71420432\" class=\"local\">'Testing when clinical features suggest an etiology'</a> below). In either situation, the use of multiple screening tests (a &quot;shotgun approach&quot;) should be avoided.</p><p>The location, acuity, and response to therapy can help guide diagnostic considerations and testing. For example, acute unilateral anterior uveitis suggests the possibility of a spondyloarthropathy, about which patients should be specifically questioned to identify whether symptoms warranting further evaluation may be present (see <a href=\"#H55582701\" class=\"local\">'History and examination'</a> above), while bilateral chronic anterior and posterior uveitis may suggest sarcoidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150162961\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing when no potential cause is apparent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with uveitis in whom the etiology remains unknown despite a detailed history and thorough examination, only limited testing is generally indicated. The location and response to therapy may help guide diagnostic considerations and testing. The author performs two tests in this population:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiography of the chest to seek evidence of pulmonary sarcoidosis or infection associated with uveitis, such as tuberculosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic test for syphilis, which may be clinically silent</p><p/><p>The use of selected tests in uveitis of unknown etiology is favored by some experts, including the author, because the underlying conditions may otherwise be clinically silent and treatment may be required, even though the likelihood of these diagnoses may be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Other experts would not obtain any laboratory testing in routine clinical practice in patients with only a single episode of uveitis, particularly unilateral acute nongranulomatous anterior uveitis, unless signs or symptoms of disease or other risk factors are present, because of the infrequency of this resulting in an additional diagnosis. However, a careful history and examination in patients with acute noninfectious anterior uveitis frequently reveals evidence of SpA that had not previously been recognized. (See <a href=\"#H55582701\" class=\"local\">'History and examination'</a> above.)</p><p>Sarcoidosis and syphilis are among the most common of the disorders causing uveitis in which the systemic (non-ocular) manifestations of the underlying disease may be clinically inapparent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrapulmonary-manifestations-of-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency with which sarcoidosis is a cause of what would otherwise be labeled idiopathic uveitis is illustrated by a study which found that 57 percent of women with uveitis between the ages of 61 and 83 had hilar adenopathy on chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, although routine radiographs were unremarkable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Although extrapolation of these findings to other patient populations is uncertain, a CT scan of the chest may be of benefit in some patients with a normal chest radiograph and uveitis in whom the diagnosis is unclear. The diagnostic value of the CT scan must be weighed against the risks from the radiation exposure from the study. As an example, a patient older than 60 with ophthalmic examination findings that suggest granulomatous inflammation, who has a normal chest radiograph and no other known etiology for the uveitis, is a good candidate for a chest CT scan. By contrast, a patient who is 30 years old with ocular findings described by an ophthalmologist as non-granulomatous might also have sarcoidosis, but the risk of the radiation and the low probability that the eye disease is sarcoid would dissuade the author from ordering a chest CT scan in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71420432\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing when clinical features suggest an etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic testing should be directed to the suspected cause when there is clinical information that suggests one of the myriad conditions that may be associated with uveitis.

The presence of leukocytes in the vitreous humor and evidence of active chorioretinal inflammation are diagnostic of intermediate uveitis and posterior uveitis, respectively. Panuveitis is defined as simultaneous inflammation in the anterior chamber, vitreous humor, and retina or choroid. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis frequently occurs in association with other systemic medical conditions, especially infections and inflammatory diseases, but may occur as an isolated process. Approximately 30 percent of patients with uveitis do not have an identifiable infectious etiology, a distinct pattern such as pars planitis, or any apparent associated systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infectious causes of uveitis include bacterial and spirochetal diseases, viral diseases, fungal infections, and parasitic infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61247 \">table 1A</a>). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important etiology in patients with human immunodeficiency virus <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIV)/acquired</span> immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ocular toxoplasmosis can affect both normal and immunocompromised hosts but is far more common in immune competent patients, in contrast to central nervous system toxoplasmosis that is seen almost exclusively in the immune-compromised. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infectious causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various systemic inflammatory diseases are associated with uveitis, including spondyloarthritis (SpA, eg, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), sarcoidosis, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Multiple sclerosis (MS), more commonly associated with optic neuritis, may also cause uveitis. Several medications may cause uveitis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Systemic inflammatory diseases'</a> above and <a href=\"#H56535411\" class=\"local\">'Drugs and hypersensitivity reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis symptoms depend on the portion of the uveal tract affected. Anterior uveitis may produce pain and redness; posterior or intermediate uveitis is more likely to be painless, but is often associated with floaters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> some degree of visual loss. Visual loss may occur with anterior, intermediate, or posterior involvement. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slit lamp and funduscopic examination are necessary to establish the presence of uveitis. Examination should include scleral depression to assess for inflammation just posterior to the lens (the pars plana of the uveal tract). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellular infiltration that is not due to inflammation may occur in hematologic and lymphoproliferative disorders. Central nervous system lymphoma may &quot;masquerade&quot; as uveitis. (See <a href=\"#H84697132\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed medical history is the most important step to diagnose an associated systemic disease. In patients in whom there is no apparent cause, a chest radiograph and serologic test for syphilis are suggested by the author and additional experts, although other experts limit laboratory testing in routine clinical practice to patients with recurrent uveitis or signs, symptoms, or risk factors for a specific underlying diagnosis. Further diagnostic testing may include chest computed tomography (CT) scan and evaluation to exclude other infections, systemic inflammatory disease, or MS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55902 \">table 1C</a>). Because of a strong association between uveitis affecting the pars plana (pars planitis) and MS, particular attention should be given to the neurologic history in patients with pars planitis.
