Although typical of asthma, these symptoms are nonspecific, making it sometimes difficult to distinguish asthma from other respiratory diseases. The definitive diagnosis of asthma requires the history or presence of respiratory symptoms consistent with asthma, combined with the demonstration of variable expiratory airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Tools used in the diagnosis of asthma include history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, and other laboratory evaluations. This topic review describes these tools, followed by several specific strategies for making the diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults. </p><p>The diagnosis of asthma in children and older adults and an overview of asthma management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of asthma in older adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While asthma is readily recognized in its classic presentation, with intermittent cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath brought on by characteristic triggers and relieved by bronchodilating medications, it is difficult to provide a definition that distinguishes asthma from similar and overlapping conditions. In the absence of a definitive laboratory test or biomarker, asthma has defied precise definition, one acceptable to all disciplines (including clinicians, physiologists, and pathologists). Clinically, its symptoms are non-specific. Physiologically, asthma is characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the tendency of airways to narrow excessively in response to a variety of stimuli that provoke little or no bronchoconstriction in persons without airway disease, but bronchial hyperresponsiveness is not unique to asthma. Pathologically, asthma may be described broadly as &quot;a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, this description omits the characteristic waxing and waning of airflow obstruction in asthma and fails to distinguish asthma from other inflammatory airways disorders, such as chronic bronchitis or bronchiolitis. </p><p>A more precise definition combines the central roles of inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness with the characteristic clinical symptoms. Towards this end, asthma has been defined by the Expert Panel 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program as &quot;a common chronic disorder of the airways that is complex and characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and an underlying inflammation. The interaction of these features of asthma determines the clinical manifestations and severity of asthma and the response to treatment&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This definition is descriptive of key features of the disease, but it lacks utility for patients and clinicians. </p><p>The Global Initiative for Asthma defines asthma as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: &quot;Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.&quot; </p><p>Many of the features described above for asthma overlap with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sometimes the distinction between asthma and COPD is clear: chronic exercise limitation and persistent airflow obstruction in a middle-aged or older person with a history of more than 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking point to a diagnosis of COPD. In COPD, pre- and post-bronchodilator pulmonary function testing may confirm little or no reversibility of the airflow obstruction. At other times, however, the distinction is less clear, such as when patients with COPD exhibit episodic symptoms and a large reversible component to their airflow obstruction. Recognition of these overlapping features of both asthma and COPD in some patients has led to description of the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H20489068\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>&quot;Reactive airways disease&quot; is an imprecise term that has been used to describe transient symptoms of cough and wheeze when confirmation of a diagnosis of asthma is lacking. Although it may be appropriate as a description of intermittent wheezing in very young children in whom a diagnosis of asthma cannot yet be definitively ascertained, it should be avoided in adolescents and adults in whom additional testing is available to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS)&quot; refers to an airway disorder resulting from an intense exposure to an inhaled chemical irritant or noxious gas. It is characterized by asthma-like features of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is diagnosed before the age of seven years in approximately 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, clinicians treating adolescents and adults will often encounter patients whose diagnosis of asthma was made years earlier. Many children experience a remission of asthma symptoms around the time of puberty, with potential recurrence years later. Asthma may develop at any age, although new-onset asthma is less frequent in older adults compared to other age groups. Occupational asthma, aspirin-sensitive asthma (aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease), and eosinophilic asthma are distinct syndromes that typically have their onset in adulthood. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pattern of respiratory symptoms that occur following exposure to triggers (eg, allergen, exercise, viral infection) and resolve with trigger avoidance or asthma medication is typical of asthma. Some patients will report all three of the classic symptoms of asthma, while others may report only one or two: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheeze (high-pitched whistling sound, usually upon exhalation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough (often worse at night)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p><p/><p>&quot;Wheezing&quot; does not have a standard meaning for patients and may be used by those without a medical background to describe a variety of sounds, including upper airway noises emanating from the nose or throat. Cough may be dry or productive of clear mucoid or pale yellow sputum (made discolored by the presence of eosinophils). Asthma is a potential cause of unexplained chronic cough. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients describe chest tightness, a band-like constriction, or the sensation of a heavy weight on the chest. In contrast, sharp chest pain is rarely used to describe the sensation of asthma.</p><p>Because the symptoms of asthma are also seen in several other respiratory diseases, it is difficult to be certain of the diagnosis of asthma based upon history alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, certain historical features heighten the probability of asthma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Episodic symptoms</strong> &ndash; Asthmatic symptoms characteristically come and go, with a time course of hours to days, resolving spontaneously with removal from the triggering stimulus or in response to anti-asthmatic medications. Patients with asthma may remain asymptomatic for long periods of time. Report of symptoms that occur or worsen at night is often a feature of asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Characteristic triggers</strong> &ndash; Respiratory symptoms triggered by exercise, cold air, and exposure to inhaled allergens (aeroallergens) are suggestive of asthma. A list of questions that can help elicit a history of asthma triggers is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Exercise-triggered symptoms typically develop 5 to 15 minutes <strong>after</strong> a brief (eg, five minutes) period of exertion or about 15 minutes into prolonged exercise and resolve with rest over approximately 30 to 60 minutes. This time-course is distinct from simple exertional dyspnea, which typically begins shortly after the onset of exertion and abates within five minutes of stopping exercise. In asthma, exercise-induced symptoms occur more commonly and are more intense when the inhaled air is cold. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Allergens that commonly trigger asthmatic symptoms include dust mites, molds, furry animals, cockroaches, and pollens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The acute onset of lower respiratory tract symptoms reliably precipitated by exposure to a cat or dog is virtually pathognomonic of asthma. Allergenic foods very rarely cause isolated asthma symptoms without other simultaneous allergic manifestations, such as angioedema, urticaria, hypotension, or gastrointestinal distress. Symptoms brought on by irritant-type exposures (eg, cigarette smoke, strong fumes, changes in weather, airborne chemicals or dusts) are non-specific and do not favor a diagnosis of asthma over other respiratory diseases. Viral infections are common triggers for asthma, although they can provoke exacerbations in other chronic respiratory conditions as well. Moreover, acute viral bronchitis in the absence of asthma may at least transiently cause respiratory symptoms that mimic asthma. Unique to asthma is the onset of cough, wheeze, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest tightness 30 to 120 minutes following ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or any cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor (referred to as &quot;aspirin-sensitive asthma&quot; or &quot;aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;), but this sensitivity occurs in only a small minority (3 to 5 percent) of asthmatic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other rare but characteristic sensitivities that may occasionally be reported by persons with asthma include symptoms triggered by ingestion of sulfites or certain food dyes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic and asthmatic reactions to food additives&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Work-related exposures</strong> - It is estimated that as many as 10 percent of cases of new-onset asthma in the adult are due to workplace-related exposures (occupational asthma). The diagnosis may be suspected based on a characteristic history of asthmatic symptoms temporally associated with work-related exposures, especially in occupations in which there is exposure to known sensitizing agents. The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of variable airflow obstruction before and after a work shift, and in some cases the diagnosis is supported by identification of IgE-specific antibodies in the blood to the offending sensitizer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Personal or family history of atopy</strong> &ndash; A strong family history of asthma and allergies or a personal history of atopic diseases (eg, atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis) favors a diagnosis of asthma in a patient with suggestive respiratory symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-asthma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for asthma&quot;, section on 'Atopy and allergens'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History of asthmatic symptoms as a child</strong> &ndash; As previously mentioned, recollection of childhood symptoms of chronic cough, nocturnal cough in the absence of respiratory infections, or a childhood diagnosis of &quot;recurrent bronchitis&quot; or &quot;wheezy bronchitis&quot; favors asthma, but may also be reported in someone with bronchiectasis or simply frequent childhood respiratory infections. </p><p/><p>Certain historic features lessen the prior probability of asthma. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of improvement following anti-asthmatic medications &ndash; Patients who have tried an inhaled bronchodilator and obtained no relief of their symptoms are less likely to have asthma. Similarly, lack of dramatic improvement with a course of oral glucocorticoids suggests a diagnosis other than asthma. (See <a href=\"#H20489068\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of symptoms after age 50 &ndash; In middle-aged and older patients, other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases with overlapping manifestations become the more likely explanation for these symptoms although the new onset of asthma remains a possibility. The evaluation of asthma in older adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of asthma in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant symptoms such as chest pain, lightheadedness, syncope, or palpitations suggest an alternate diagnosis such as pulmonary vascular disease, cardiomyopathy, early coronary artery disease, or pericardial disease.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widespread, high-pitched, musical wheezes are a characteristic feature of asthma, although wheezes are not specific for asthma and are usually absent between asthma exacerbations. Wheezes are heard most commonly on expiration, but can also occur during inspiration. Asthmatic wheezing usually involves sounds of multiple different pitches, starting and stopping at various points in the respiratory cycle and varying in tone and duration over time. It is different from the monophasic wheezing of a local bronchial narrowing (eg, due to an aspirated foreign body or bronchogenic cancer), which has single pitch and repeatedly begins and ends at the same point in each respiratory cycle.</p><p>Expiratory noises transmitted from the upper airway (eg, larynx, pharynx) can mimic wheezing and are often described as wheezing by patients. However, these upper airway noises are typically loudest over the neck and greatly diminished over the chest in contrast to true wheezes that are typically louder over the chest. Patients may be able to identify respiratory noises as inspiratory rather than expiratory. Clinicians can usually distinguish the low-pitched wheezes (also called &quot;rhonchi&quot;) that clear with cough, a sign of increased airway secretions as may be seen in bronchitis or bronchiectasis, from the typical high-pitched expiratory wheezes of asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing illnesses other than asthma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physical findings that suggest <strong>severe</strong> airflow obstruction in asthma include tachypnea, tachycardia, prolonged expiratory phase of respiration (decreased I:E ratio), and a seated position with use of extended arms to support the upper chest (&quot;tripod position&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Use of the accessory muscles of breathing (eg, sternocleidomastoid) during inspiration and a pulsus paradoxus (greater than 12 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure during inspiration) are usually found only during severe asthmatic attacks. However, these signs are insensitive manifestations of severe airflow obstruction; their absence does not exclude the possibility of a severe asthmatic attack. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical findings'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Importantly, the presence or absence of wheezing on physical examination is a poor predictor of the severity of airflow obstruction in asthma. Wheezing may be heard in patients with mild, moderate, or severe airway narrowing, while widespread airway narrowing may be present in individuals without wheezing. Thus, the presence of wheezing alerts one to the likely presence of airway narrowing, but not its severity. </p><p>Extrapulmonary physical findings in patients with asthma that can provide evidence in support of or against a diagnosis of asthma include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale, swollen membranes on examination of the nasal cavities with an otoscope and a cobblestone appearance to the posterior pharyngeal wall suggest associated allergic rhinitis, a common condition among patients with allergic asthma.

Since aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity) is uncommon in childhood, the finding of nasal polyps in an adolescent with lower respiratory tract symptoms should lead to consideration of alternative diagnoses, specifically cystic fibrosis.

In early childhood it is a risk factor for the later development of asthma, with as many as a third of children with atopic dermatitis progressing to asthma.

Acute reversibility of airflow obstruction is tested by administering 2 to 4 puffs of a quick-acting bronchodilator (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>), preferably with a valved holding-chamber (&quot;spacer&quot;), and repeating spirometry 10 to 15 minutes later. Measurements can also be made before and after administration of nebulized bronchodilator. An increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 12 percent or more, accompanied by an absolute increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of at least 200 mL, can be attributed to bronchodilator responsiveness with 95 percent certainty.</p><p>The presence of a bronchodilator response, in isolation, is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of asthma, however. Bronchodilator responsiveness may be seen with other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis. Asthma is typically distinguished from these other conditions by the capacity for a &quot;large&quot; increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>. The definition of a large bronchodilator response is not standardized; investigators generally classify a large response as at least 15 or 20 percent. However, there is no precise cutoff value that defines an &quot;asthmatic&quot; bronchodilator response.</p><p>Occasionally, patients with asthma will have airflow obstruction on spirometry but fail to exhibit a 12 percent or greater increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> following bronchodilator (a &quot;false negative&quot; response).

Bronchoprovocation testing can be used to identify or exclude airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with atypical presentations (eg, normal baseline spirometry, no variability in airflow limitation with serial spirometry or peak flow) or isolated symptoms of asthma, especially cough. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p>A provocative stimulus (eg, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, exercise, or hyperventilation of dry air) is used to stimulate bronchoconstriction. People with asthma are more sensitive (hyperresponsive) to such stimuli than those without asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82365 \">figure 4</a>). When paradoxical vocal cord motion is being considered in the differential, an inspiratory and expiratory flow volume loop and sometimes also direct laryngoscopy are performed during bronchoprovocation testing to identify an upper airway response mimicking asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion#H19239745\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function tests'</a>.)</p><p>The technical aspects of performing this type of testing, interpreting the results, and identifying the causes of false positive and false negative results are presented separately. A positive test (indicating bronchial hyperresponsiveness) is not entirely specific for asthma. Using a cut point of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> or less to indicate the presence of hyperresponsiveness, as many as 5 percent of the normal population and a greater percentage of non-asthmatic persons with rhinitis will exhibit positive results. However, false negative results are uncommon, and a negative test (no significant decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> at the highest dose of methacholine administered) performed in a patient off controller therapy for asthma reliably excludes the diagnosis of asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic challenge'</a>.)</p><p>Other specialized provocation testing can be used when further evaluation of the role of a specific precipitating factor is needed. Typical examples include measuring lung function before and after exercise when a diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction related to asthma is suspected and evaluation of possible occupational asthma by FEV<sub>1</sub> or PEF measurements made before and after the work shift.

We typically use PEF measurements to monitor patients with a known diagnosis of asthma or to assess the role of a particular occupational exposure or trigger, rather than as a tool for the primary diagnosis of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, it is not diagnostic because a reduced peak flow is not specific for airflow obstruction and can be seen with other pulmonary processes. On the other hand, a reduced peak flow that improves by more than 20 percent approximately 10 to 20 minutes after administration of a quick-acting bronchodilator (eg, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>) provides supportive evidence favoring the diagnosis of asthma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PEF measurements may vary as much as 15 to 20 percent from one measurement to the next in patients with asthma but without symptoms and in individuals without asthma. PEF results that vary little over time (less than 20 percent of the maximal value) argue against the diagnosis of asthma, particularly if reported symptoms are associated with unchanging peak flow measurements.

The test is based on the observation that the eosinophilic airway inflammation associated with asthma leads to up-regulation of nitric oxide synthase in the respiratory mucosa, which in turn generates increased amounts of nitric oxide gas in the exhaled breath. Carefully calibrated equipment is designed to differentiate the concentration (in parts per billion) of nitric oxide in the exhaled breath of persons with asthma from the low levels of nitric oxide present in the exhaled breath of normal individuals. Use of oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inhaled glucocorticoids reduces airway inflammation and levels of exhaled nitric oxide. Further studies are required to define better the sensitivity and specificity of exhaled nitric oxide as a diagnostic test for asthma, particularly among persons with other, potentially confounding respiratory diseases.

However, a complete blood count (CBC) with differential white blood cell analysis to screen for eosinophilia or significant anemia may be helpful in certain cases. We typically obtain a CBC and differential when asthma symptoms are severe, the patient presents to the hospital with an exacerbation, nasal polyposis is present, the chest radiograph is abnormal (eg, suggestive of eosinophilic pneumonia or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Churg Strauss]), or a parasitic infection is suspected.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markedly elevated eosinophil percentages (&gt;15 percent) or counts (&gt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL)</span> may be due to allergic asthma, but should prompt consideration of alternative or additional diagnoses, including parasitic infections (eg, Strongyloides), drug reactions, and syndromes of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia.

In addition to the peripheral blood eosinophil count mentioned above, the main tests for allergy are the total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level and the tests for specific allergic sensitization, which include blood testing for specific IgE antibody to inhalant allergens and skin testing with extracts of inhalant allergens.</p><p>Measurement of total serum IgE levels is indicated in patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma when considering treatment with anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>) or when allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is suspected on the basis of eosinophilia, a positive skin test to aspergillus, or radiographic evidence of mucus plugging or central bronchiectasis. An elevated total IgE level may occur in the absence of asthma (eg, in allergic rhinitis or eczema), and allergic asthma may be present in the absence of an elevated total IgE level, which may not fully reflect the levels of mast cell-bound IgE in airway tissue. Very high total IgE levels (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL)</span> are typically found in persons with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, certain parasitic infections, and sometimes eczema.

This type of blood test is often referred to as RAST, although the radioallergosorbent assay method has been replaced with a non-radioactive detection reagent, called an immunoassay. Based on the aeroallergens in the patient's geographic location and household, a panel of immunoassays is ordered. Aeroallergens (eg, house dust mite antigen, cat and dog danders, cockroach antigen, mouse and rat antigens, pollens, and mold spores) are the types of allergens most commonly implicated in asthma. Orally ingested food allergens rarely cause isolated asthmatic symptoms; inhaled food particles (eg, fish cooking, peanut dust on airplane) occasionally trigger asthma symptoms. By asking relatively few specific questions, clinicians can often elicit a potential relationship between allergen exposure and asthmatic symptoms that will guide the choice of which antigens to assess by immunoassay (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507 \">table 1</a>). When ordering these blood tests, one can select specific antigens for testing or choose among pre-grouped panels of antigens. The technique and accuracy of immunoassays are discussed separately.

The negative predictive value of skin testing (using prick and intradermal techniques) is very high, such that skin testing can exclude allergy with relative certainty.

The indications, contraindications, technique, and interpretation of allergy skin tests are presented in detail separately.

The diagnosis of asthma is confirmed by a reliable series of recordings that document more than 20 percent variability in FEV<sub>1</sub> or PEF over time (especially when these reductions are associated with asthmatic symptoms). Individuals without asthma experience little variability (10 percent or less) in their PEF, even when respiratory symptoms are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Similar data collection can take place in the clinician's office by recording spirometry or PEF at each patient visit.

This diagnostic strategy is particularly useful for patients with atypical symptoms or an atypical response to medications. Given the test's high negative predictive value, it is especially useful when exclusion of a diagnosis of asthma is helpful in patient management. Bronchoprovocation testing is a relatively costly diagnostic strategy and relies on the expertise of sophisticated pulmonary function laboratories.

The combination of a typical presentation (eg, repeated episodes of typical symptoms triggered by typical stimuli), musical wheezes on auscultation, and a prompt response to anti-asthma medication may be used to make a presumptive diagnosis, as might occur for new-onset asthma presenting in an acute care setting. However, we agree with the NAEPP guidelines that the clinical diagnosis of asthma should be validated with objective data, whenever possible. For patients with less typical or more persistent or refractory symptoms, formal spirometric data are essential to ensure that the correct diagnosis is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20489068\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, while characteristic of asthma, are also symptoms of a number of other respiratory diseases affecting both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.

Expiratory wheezes emanating from the upper airway (eg, vocal cord dysfunction syndrome) are often readily audible without a stethoscope but sound distant on auscultation of the lower chest. However, at times these upper airway sounds may be transmitted widely throughout the chest, making differentiation from asthma difficult.

Obtaining the clinical history in an adult should include questions about the presence of symptoms earlier in life. Other historic clues that are highly suggestive of asthma include recurring, episodic symptoms, the presence of typical triggers (especially exercise, cold air, or allergen exposure), and personal or family history of allergic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination may be normal in asthma. The presence of abnormal findings (such as wheezing) is suggestive of asthma, although not specific. Asthmatic wheezing is typically composed of multiple high-pitched sounds audible most prominently during expiration. Nasal examination should be included to check for the pale, swollen mucosa of associated allergic rhinitis or nasal polyps, which raise the possibility of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pulmonary function tests most helpful in diagnosing asthma are spirometry pre and post bronchodilator, bronchoprovocation testing (usually with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring. Expiratory airflow obstruction with a reversible reduction in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), heightened sensitivity to bronchoprovocative agents such as methacholine or exercise, and variability over time of &gt;20 percent in PEF are findings consistent with asthma. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function testing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other laboratory studies are sometimes indicated to identify potential asthma triggers and exclude alternative diagnoses, including blood tests (eg, allergen immunoassays), skin testing for environmental allergies, and a chest radiograph. (See <a href=\"#H24992570\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of asthma is based upon the presence or history of symptoms consistent with asthma (most commonly episodic cough, wheezing, or dyspnea provoked by typical triggers), combined with the demonstration of variable expiratory airflow obstruction.

An obstructive pattern with an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of more than 12 percent from the baseline measurement, following administration of 2 to 4 puffs of a quick-acting bronchodilator, is suggestive of asthma, especially if post-bronchodilator spirometry is normal.
