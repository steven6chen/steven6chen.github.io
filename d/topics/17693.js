Treatment of BCC is indicated due to the locally invasive, aggressive, and destructive effects of BCC on skin and surrounding tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68274%7EDERM%2F81632\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68274 graphicRef81632 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>Tumor characteristics such as size, location, and pathology influence the likelihood for deep tumor invasion and recurrence of BCC after treatment. Lesions at high risk for recurrence may benefit from removal with Mohs micrographic surgery, a procedure that allows for the assessment of all margins of excised tissue. Alternative therapies include conventional surgical excision and radiation therapy (RT). Electrodessication and curettage (ED&amp;C), cryosurgery, and topical 5-fluorouracil or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> are not recommended for the management of these BCCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70043 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The treatment of BCCs with clinical or pathologic features associated with increased risk for recurrence will be reviewed here.

Other options for the treatment of these lesions include surgical excision and radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70043 \">table 1</a>). Conventional surgical excision has lower cure rates than Mohs surgery and provides pathologic assessment of only a small fraction of the excisional margin but is faster, less expensive, and more widely available than Mohs surgery. In older patients with high-risk BCC who are not surgical candidates, RT may be used for management. Disadvantages of RT include a lower cure rate, the need for multiple clinic visits, high cost, and potential risk for long-term adverse effects.

In contrast to routine histopathologic processing of a conventional surgical excision specimen, which permits evaluation of less than 1 percent of the excised tissue margins, Mohs surgery allows for histologic evaluation of 100 percent of the margins. Mohs surgery is performed in the outpatient setting under local anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In a prospective, randomized trial, 408 primary facial BCCs with features associated with increased risk for recurrence (size &gt;1 cm, location in high-risk facial site, or aggressive histopathologic growth pattern) and 204 recurrent facial BCCs were treated with Mohs surgery or standard surgical excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At five years, the recurrence rates were similar in the two groups (2.5 percent for Mohs surgery versus 4.1 percent for standard surgical excision). However, in an extended follow-up study of the same cohort, the 10-year recurrence rates were significantly lower in the Mohs surgery group than in the standard excision group for both primary and recurrent BCCs (4.4 versus 12.2 percent and 3.9 versus 13.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The recurrence rate after Mohs surgery appears to be higher for lesions with histologic evidence for perineural invasion. In a series of 3020 patients with BCC (including 78 patients with BCCs with perineural invasion), five-year recurrence rates for patients with or without perineural invasion were 8 and 2 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The tissue-sparing effect of Mohs surgery is also useful in cosmetically sensitive or functionally critical areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Recurrent BCCs, especially those located in high-risk sites, are candidates for Mohs surgery, particularly because recurrent tumors tend to develop more aggressive histologic subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mohs surgery is <strong>not</strong> indicated for small primary BCCs located on the trunk or extremities that lack aggressive clinical or pathologic features, because other procedures have similar efficacy and are less time consuming and less costly.

Another major advantage is the ability of Mohs surgery to spare normal tissue, thus allowing preservation of vital structures, simplifying repair (and hence, the cost of the repair) of the surgical wound, and improving the cosmetic results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery#H9483386\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;, section on 'Advantages and disadvantages'</a>.)</p><p>A typical Mohs surgery procedure lasts two to four hours, and more complicated cases can take longer. Reconstruction following Mohs surgery can add another hour to the procedure. A significant amount of the total time is spent with the histologic preparation and analysis; during this time, patients are temporarily bandaged and may await the final results in a waiting room. A small minority of patients may find it difficult to tolerate a procedure of this length.</p><p>Mohs surgery is more expensive than standard surgical excision. Whether Mohs surgery is cost effective is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One study in the United States concluded that Mohs surgery was cost effective because of the much lower rates of local disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, a subsequent analysis in the Netherlands concluded that Mohs surgery was not cost effective, based upon the low rates of recurrence seen in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, these results are difficult to interpret since the study was limited to a follow-up period of 30 months for primary BCCs and 18 months for recurrent lesions. In addition, cost determination and accounting for surgery differs considerably among countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031894\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional surgical excision with postoperative margin assessment is commonly used for BCCs with a low likelihood for recurrence and is effective for the treatment of select higher-risk lesions.</p><p>Although cure rates for lesions with a low risk of recurrence can exceed 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>], the efficacy of conventional excision is less consistent in the management of BCCs with clinical or pathologic features associated with a high risk for recurrence (see <a href=\"#H12329758\" class=\"local\">'Features associated with high risk for recurrence'</a> above). Examples of reported cure rates for conventional excision in tumors that are large, located in high sites, or recurrent include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary BCCs &gt;15, &gt;20, or &gt;30 mm in diameter; 88, 83, and 77 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors located on higher-risk areas of the face and head (ie, lips, nose, paranasal or periocular region, ears, scalp); 57 to 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/7,22,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22,23,25</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent tumors; 83 to 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]</p><p/><p>Thus, when Mohs surgery is available, it is the preferred treatment for BCCs with features associated with a high risk for recurrence. However, other factors such as the availability or cost of Mohs surgery, practicality of Mohs surgery, patient tolerance for the Mohs procedure, and patient preference may lead to the selection of conventional surgical excision over Mohs surgery.</p><p>Postoperative margin assessment should be performed on all excised tissue specimens. Conventional surgical excision is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H12329774\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence#H16554092\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of basal cell carcinoma at low risk of recurrence&quot;, section on 'Surgical excision'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20395114\"><span class=\"h2\">Staged excision with circumferential margin assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Staged excision with circumferential margin assessment, sometimes referred to as &quot;slow Mohs,&quot; involves complete assessment of tissue margins utilizing formalin-fixed tissue, rather than the rapidly processed frozen sections used in standard Mohs surgery. This procedure is performed without the equipment and technician expertise required for frozen tissue processing. Although staged excision with circumferential margin assessment was associated with a 97 percent five-year clinical cure rate in a series of 1090 BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and a 99 percent five-year clinical cure rate in a separate series of 287 periocular BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], the time required to attain pathology results from formalin-fixed tissue specimens delays wound closure for days and leads to the need for repeat office visits.

RT is usually administered in a fractionated schedule that requires four or more treatments. Fractionation limits treatment-related side effects in normal tissues, but the frequent visits are problematic for many patients.</p><p>The major advantages of RT are the relative sparing of cosmetically and functionally important structures, its noninvasive and painless nature, and its utility for many patients who are not candidates for surgical intervention or for whom it is difficult to attain histologic clearance. In addition, the relative sparing of normal healthy tissue can offer superior cosmetic results for tumors located on or around the lips, nose, and eyelids. However, these favorable cosmetic results may deteriorate with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>Unlike surgical excision or Mohs surgery, RT does not provide histologic control of the tumor margin.

Electrodesiccation and curettage (ED&amp;C), cryosurgery, and topical therapy are not recommended for the treatment of these lesions. (See <a href=\"#H12329758\" class=\"local\">'Features associated with high risk for recurrence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12329774\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mohs micrographic surgery (Mohs surgery) is a procedure that utilizes frozen tissue sections to assess 100 percent of excised tissue margins. Advantages of Mohs surgery include rapid assurance of complete tumor removal and a tissue-sparing effect. Disadvantages include the time, cost, and expertise required to perform this procedure. (See <a href=\"#H12329803\" class=\"local\">'Mohs surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional surgical excision is commonly used for the treatment of low-risk BCC and can be used for the management of some high-risk lesions, provided lower cure rates are acceptable. Less than 1 percent of the tissue margin is examined after conventional surgical excision, contributing to cure rates that are lower compared with Mohs surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1031894\" class=\"local\">'Surgical excision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with BCCs at high risk for recurrence, we recommend excision using either Mohs surgery or a conventional surgical approach (provided lower cure rates are acceptable) to completely resect the tumor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Mohs surgery may be particularly advantageous in cosmetically and functionally critical areas.

For older patients with high-risk lesions who are not candidates for surgical excision, RT is a reasonable alternative.
