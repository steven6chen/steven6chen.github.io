The urinalysis reveals red cells (which often have a dysmorphic appearance), occasionally red cell casts, and mild proteinuria (usually less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. The findings of more advanced disease are usually absent, such as heavy proteinuria, edema, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. These patients often present with asymptomatic hematuria and proteinuria discovered on routine examination or, occasionally, with episodes of gross hematuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe nephritic &ndash; The urinalysis in diffuse glomerulonephritis is similar to focal disease, but heavy proteinuria (which may be in the nephrotic range), edema, hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal insufficiency may be observed. Diffuse glomerulonephritis affects most or all of the glomeruli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrotic &ndash; The nephrotic sediment is associated with heavy proteinuria and lipiduria, but few cells or casts. The term &quot;nephrotic syndrome&quot; refers to a distinct constellation of clinical and laboratory features of renal disease. It is specifically defined by the presence of heavy proteinuria (protein excretion greater than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours), hypoalbuminemia (less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and peripheral edema. Hyperlipidemia and thrombotic disease are also frequently observed.</p><p/><p>Isolated heavy proteinuria without edema or other features of the nephrotic syndrome is suggestive of a glomerulopathy (with the same etiologies as the nephrotic syndrome), but is not necessarily associated with the multiple clinical and management problems characteristic of the nephrotic syndrome. This is an important clinical distinction because heavy proteinuria in patients without edema or hypoalbuminemia is more likely to be due to secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (due, for example, to diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome, with emphasis on those disorders with a nephrotic presentation (ie, bland rather than active urine sediment). More specific issues relating to complications of the nephrotic syndrome are presented elsewhere.

Minimal change disease is the predominant cause in children. In adults, approximately 30 percent have a systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, or systemic lupus erythematosus; the remaining cases are usually due to primary renal disorders such as minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of the different forms of nephropathy underlying the nephrotic syndrome in adults was evaluated in a Spanish glomerulonephritis registry of 2000 patients biopsied between the years 1994 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among patients between 15 and 65 years of age, the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome were membranous nephropathy (24 percent), minimal change disease (16 percent), lupus (14 percent), FSGS (12 percent), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (7 percent), amyloidosis (6 percent), and IgA nephropathy (6 percent). A similar distribution was observed among the 725 older adult individuals (age greater than 65 years) except for an increased prevalence of amyloidosis (17 percent) and a decreased prevalence of lupus (1 percent).</p><p>The relative frequency of the different disorders has varied over time in some series as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 233 renal biopsies performed between 1995 and 1997 at the University of Chicago in adults with nephrotic syndrome (in the absence of an obvious underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus or lupus) found the major causes to be membranous nephropathy and FSGS (33 and 35 percent, respectively), minimal change disease (15 percent), and amyloidosis (4 percent overall, but 10 percent in patients over age 44 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. FSGS accounted for more than 50 percent of cases of nephrotic syndrome in black individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The frequency of FSGS was much lower (15 percent) among biopsies for nephrotic syndrome performed at the same institution between 1976 and 1979. The increased prevalence of FSGS in the 1995 to 1997 series was observed in both black and white individuals. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a report from Springfield, Massachusetts, which compared renal biopsies at a single center that were performed in two time periods: 1975-1979 and 1990-1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over time, the relative frequency of membranous nephropathy fell from 38 to 15 percent, while the frequency of FSGS increased from 14 to 25 percent overall; this increase was primarily seen in black and Hispanic patients. The relative incidence of FSGS also appears to have increased in Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in FSGS is not restricted to black populations. A retrospective analysis of the patterns of glomerular disease a in predominantly white cohort from Minnesota showed a 13-fold increase in FSGS and no change in membranous nephropathy frequency between 1994 and 2003 compared with the interval between 1974 and 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Nephrotic proteinuria was present in 80 percent of the patients with FSGS. </p><p/><p>The nephrotic syndrome can also develop in patients with postinfectious glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and IgA nephropathy. However, these individuals typically have a &quot;nephritic&quot; type of urinalysis with hematuria and cellular (including red cell) casts as a prominent feature. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimal change disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimal change disease (also called nil disease or lipoid nephrosis) accounts for 90 percent of cases of the nephrotic syndrome in children under the age of 10 years, and more than 50 percent of cases in older children. It also may occur in adults as an idiopathic condition, in association with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), or as a paraneoplastic effect of malignancy, most often Hodgkin lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The terms &quot;minimal change&quot; and &quot;nil disease&quot; reflect the observation that light microscopy in this disorder is either normal or reveals only mild mesangial cell proliferation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58414 \">picture 1</a>). Immunofluorescence and light microscopy typically show no evidence of immune complex deposition. The characteristic histologic finding in minimal change disease is diffuse effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes on electron microscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is among the most common lesion found to underlie the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults, accounting for 35 percent of all cases in the United States and over 50 percent of cases among blacks. FSGS is characterized on light microscopy by the presence in some but not all glomeruli (hence the name focal) of segmental areas of mesangial collapse and sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67677%7ENEPH%2F63456\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67677 graphicRef63456 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. FSGS can present as an idiopathic syndrome (primary FSGS) or may be associated with HIV infection, reflux nephropathy, healed previous glomerular injury, or massive obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three important diagnostic concerns in FSGS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sampling error</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguishing primary and secondary FSGS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying FSGS associated with collapsing glomerulopathy</p><p/><p>Sampling error can easily lead to misclassification of a patient with FSGS as having minimal change disease. Clinical features that are more common in FSGS are hematuria, hypertension, and decreased renal function. There is, however, substantial overlap in these features. In addition to careful review of the renal biopsy, steroid resistance in a patient considered to have minimal change disease should raise suspicion about FSGS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Primary FSGS is an epithelial cell disorder that may be related etiologically to minimal change disease; congenital forms also exist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.) In addition, as noted above, FSGS can occur as a secondary response to nephron loss (as is reflux nephropathy) or previous glomerular injury. Differentiating primary and secondary FSGS has important therapeutic implications. The former sometimes responds to immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, while secondary disease is best treated with modalities aimed at lowering the intraglomerular pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between primary and secondary FSGS can sometimes be made from the history (such as one of the disorders associated with secondary disease) and the rate of onset and degree of proteinuria. Patients with primary FSGS typically present with the <strong>acute onset of the nephrotic syndrome</strong>, whereas slowly increasing proteinuria and renal insufficiency over time are characteristic of the secondary disorders. The proteinuria in secondary FSGS is often non-nephrotic; even when protein excretion exceeds 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> both hypoalbuminemia and edema are unusual.</p><p>Collapsing FSGS is a histologic variant that is usually but not always associated with HIV infection, bisphosphonate therapy, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Two major features distinguish it from primary FSGS: a tendency toward <strong>collapse</strong> and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft, rather than segmental injury; and often severe tubular injury with proliferative microcyst formation and tubular degeneration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F81601%7ENEPH%2F59839\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81601 graphicRef59839 \">picture 3A-B</a>). These patients often have rapidly progressive renal failure and optimal therapy is uncertain.

It is characterized by basement membrane thickening with little or no cellular proliferation or infiltration, and the presence of electron dense deposits across the glomerular basement membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57841%7ENEPH%2F74698%7ENEPH%2F55226%7ENEPH%2F69629%7ENEPH%2F62937%7ENEPH%2F69348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57841 graphicRef74698 graphicRef55226 graphicRef69629 graphicRef62937 graphicRef69348 \">picture 4A-F</a>).

Many cases of idiopathic membranous nephropathy may be due to autoantibodies directed against the phospholipase A2 receptor found on podocytes. Secondary causes include hepatitis B antigenemia, autoimmune diseases, thyroiditis, carcinoma, and the use of certain drugs such as gold, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The malignancy in presumed tumor-induced membranous nephropathy has usually been diagnosed or is clinically apparent at the time the proteinuria is discovered.

There are two major types of renal amyloidosis: AL or primary amyloid, which is a light chain dyscrasia in which fragments of monoclonal light chains form the amyloid fibrils; and AA or secondary amyloidosis, in which the acute phase reactant serum amyloid A forms the amyloid fibrils. AA amyloid is associated with a chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is suspected by a history of a chronic inflammatory disease or, with primary disease, detection of a monoclonal paraprotein in the serum or urine.

Electrical potential differences generated by transglomerular flow may modulate the flux of macromolecules across the glomerular capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], although other theories exist for the mechanism of glomerular proteinuria.</p><p>The podocyte appears to be the major target of injury in diseases that cause idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults and children (membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS]), as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The common ultrastructural phenotype seen in these diseases is podocyte foot process effacement, slit diaphragm disruption, and a relative or absolute depletion of podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary podocyte injury (eg, in patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome) is due to mutations of podocyte proteins that are important in the maintenance of the slit diaphragm such as nephrin and podocin, or mutations in proteins that affect the integrity of the podocyte cytoskeleton such as alpha-actinin-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In patients with nephrotic syndrome, albumin is the principal urinary protein, but other plasma proteins including clotting inhibitors, transferrin, immunoglobulins, and hormone carrying proteins such as vitamin D-binding protein may be lost as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endocrine dysfunction in the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoalbuminemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of hypoalbuminemia in nephrotic patients is not completely understood. Most of albumin loss is due to urinary excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, at the same level of albumin loss, patients with the nephrotic syndrome have a plasma albumin concentration that is approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> lower than patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, in which there is significant albumin loss in the dialysate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59892\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59892 \">figure 1</a>). One proposed explanation is that, in patients with nephrotic syndrome, a substantial fraction of the filtered albumin is taken up by and catabolized in the proximal tubular cells, resulting in a much greater degree of albumin loss than estimated from the rate of albumin excretion, although this hypothesis is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Hepatic albumin synthesis does increase in response to the albumin loss. This effect is mediated by an increase in hepatic albumin gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] stimulated in part by the low oncotic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Hypoalbuminemia may also lead to the release of an as yet unidentified circulating factor that contributes to the elevation in hepatic albumin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The low oncotic pressure has a second clinically important effect: it increases hepatic lipoprotein synthesis, which plays an important role in the development of hyperlipidemia. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hyperlipidemia and lipiduria'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It remains unclear why, in a patient excreting 4 to 6 g of protein per day, the liver is usually unable to sufficiently increase albumin synthesis to normalize the plasma albumin concentration. There are patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria who have little or no hypoalbuminemia; these patients are more likely to have one of the secondary forms of FSGS (such as reflux nephropathy) rather than one of the primary nephrotic disorders such as membranous nephropathy or minimal change disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One contributory factor may be the release of cytokines in the latter conditions; tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, for example, directly suppress hepatic albumin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of edema in the nephrotic syndrome. In some patients, marked hypoalbuminemia leads to egress of fluid into the interstitial space by producing a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure. In most patients however, there is a parallel fall in the interstitial protein concentration and little change in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74352\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74352 \">figure 2</a>). In the latter patients, edema appears to be the consequence of primary renal sodium retention in the collecting tubules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82649\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82649 \">figure 3</a>) mediated through the epithelial sodium channel and the basolateral Na-K-ATPase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The lack of major arterial underfilling has important implications for diuretic therapy since the excess fluid can usually be removed without inducing volume depletion.

Decreased plasma oncotic pressure appears to stimulate hepatic lipoprotein synthesis resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Diminished clearance may also play a role in the development of hypercholesterolemia. Impaired metabolism is primarily responsible for nephrotic hypertriglyceridemia.

Urinary lipid may be present in the sediment, entrapped in casts (fatty casts), enclosed by the plasma membrane of degenerative epithelial cells (oval fat bodies), or free in the urine. Under polarized light, the fat droplets have the appearance of a Maltese cross (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69603%7ENEPH%2F79604\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69603 graphicRef79604 \">picture 5A-B</a>).

Interstitial fluid tends to accumulate in dependent areas where tissue turgor is low. Thus periorbital edema upon awakening in the morning and pedal edema are common. Edema is often accompanied by serous effusions when it becomes generalized and massive (anasarca).</p><p>Less well appreciated manifestations of the nephrotic syndrome include protein malnutrition, hypovolemia, acute kidney injury, urinary loss of hormones, hyperlipidemia and the potential for accelerated atherosclerosis, a tendency to venous or arterial thrombosis, and increased susceptibility to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A loss in lean body mass with negative nitrogen balance often occurs in patients with marked proteinuria, although it may be masked by weight gain due to concurrently increasing edema.

The mechanism is not understood; several factors including hypovolemia, interstitial edema, ischemic tubular injury, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been suggested.

Cerebral vein thrombosis has also been rarely reported. The mechanism of the hypercoagulability is not completely understood.

It can present acutely or, much more commonly, in an indolent manner. The acute presentation includes flank pain, gross hematuria, and a decline in renal function. Most patients are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis is suspected only when pulmonary thromboembolism develops.

This can result in glucosuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, bicarbonaturia, and vitamin D deficiency (all features of a proximal renal tubular acidosis). A decrease in thyroxine-binding globulins can cause marked changes in various thyroid function tests, although patients are clinically euthyroid. Anemia, perhaps due to the urinary loss or impaired synthesis of erythropoietin, has also been described in a few patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

Patients excreting more than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> are considered to have nephrotic-range proteinuria. </p><p>There is an alternative to the cumbersome 24-hour urine collection: calculating the total protein-to-creatinine ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/mg)</span> on a random urine specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This ratio correlates closely with daily protein excretion in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area. Thus, a ratio of 4.9 (as with respective urinary protein and creatinine concentrations of 210 and 43 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> represents daily protein excretion of approximately 4.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-spot-urine-protein-to-creatinine-ratio-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). There are limitations to estimating proteinuria from a random urine specimen, particularly in patients whose daily creatinine generation varies substantially from 1000 mg. We prefer to obtain a 24-hour urine collection in most patients during the initial evaluation of proteinuria.

This is usually achieved by the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Potentially adverse effects of these agents include an acute decline in glomerular filtration rate and hyperkalemia; serum creatinine and potassium levels should be measured during the initiation and titration of these drugs.

There generally is a lesser natriuresis than seen in normal patients because of hypoalbuminemia (causing decreased delivery of protein bound drug to the kidney) and albuminuria (binding the drug within the tubular lumen). For these reasons, the diuretic dose often has to be increased. Addition of diuretics that act on different nephron segments may also be useful. An important guide for the evaluation of diuretic therapy is serial measurement of body weight.
