This discussion will provide a general overview of the blood donor medical history as a means for screening donors in the United States for the possibility that their blood products might transmit such infections. Issues related to the actual procedures involved in blood donor screening and the laboratory testing of donated blood are discussed separately.

Uniform donor medical history criteria ensure that similar donor screening occurs regardless of the collection facility. While laboratory testing is highly effective at removing units with the potential to transmit infection from the blood supply, the donor medical history makes additional contributions to reducing these and other complications of blood transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples include reducing the risk of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with an organism for which blood is not tested (eg, malaria)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to a medication with teratogenic potential (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The theoretical risk of transmission of other illnesses (eg, malignancy), despite the lack of evidence that such transmission is possible</p><p/><p>Donor screening also serves to protect the donor in cases where there is a risk to the donor's health from donating blood (eg, heart disease, pregnancy).</p><p>Finally, donor screening may reduce the costs (to the blood donation center and the blood donor) of going through the donation process in cases where the donated unit cannot be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Process of donor screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major procedure for screening donors at the donation site is the medical history interview, which contains questions to protect the recipient from acquiring a transfusion transmitted infection and to protect the donor from suffering an adverse reaction after donation.</p><p>In order to exclude donors who may be bacteremic, viremic, or parasitemic, blood is not collected from persons who are febrile at the time of donation, who state that they do not feel well, or who are taking systemic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In 1983, with the recognition of the possible transmission of HIV by transfusion, the health history interview assumed new importance and became more complex and probing than it had previously been. The trend of adding medically sophisticated questions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> socially sensitive behavioral questions to the donor interview has continued to the present day. Donors are asked questions concerning their sexual activities, their injection drug use history, and their history of selected sexually transmitted diseases. Donors are also queried concerning exposure to or medical history of hepatitis, malaria, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), babesiosis, and Chagas disease.</p><p>Medical history questions concerning specific risk factors for infectious disease need to meet the deferral criteria established by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations. Furthermore, each blood center's medical history standard operating procedure must be approved by the FDA. Variation between blood centers in the exact wording of questions or in the format of interviewing blood donors is permitted.</p><p>An interagency task force under the auspices of AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks) developed and standardized a uniform set of donor questions and validated these through cognitively based research protocols. This Uniform Donor History Questionnaire (UDHQ) has been approved by the FDA and is being used by many blood centers; a revised version was adopted in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It can be administered orally or can be self-administered, with follow-up questioning by a health historian if the donor's responses raise questions about donor eligibility.</p><p>Because many questions in the medical history refer to events in the remote past, the FDA has also approved an abbreviated donor history questionnaire (aDHQ) designed to identify recent changes in medical, behavior, and travel information that have occurred since a donor's previous donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. The aDHQ eliminates questions about events or behaviors that, if a donor had previously answered &quot;no&quot; on the UDHQ, would not need to be asked in future interviews of that donor. To be eligible to receive the aDHQ, the donor has to donate at an acceptable frequency, and the blood collection agency would need to have a policy permitting use of this instrument.</p><p>In addition, many blood centers have implemented a computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI) process that includes audio, pictorial (visual), and touch-screen components. A two-year evaluation at one blood center showed that identification of high-risk behaviors among prospective first time donors significantly increased following the use of CASI when compared with results obtained from the previously administered oral questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15491361\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluating donor history questions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The value of donor history questions depends on the willingness of potential donors to reveal high-risk behaviors for infectious diseases. Investigators from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) evaluated the potential sensitivity of medical history questions for detecting behavioral infectious disease risk by mailing an anonymous survey questionnaire to 50,162 individuals who successfully donated blood within the previous four to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The percentage of donors who admitted to behavioral infectious disease risk factors was compared with the percentage that admitted these behaviors at the time of their donation, using a 53 question, optical scan format questionnaire that addressed demographics, donation history, comprehension of written donation literature, use of confidential unit exclusion (CUE) or callback procedures, sexual history, injection drug use history, other history related to HIV risk, HIV test seeking, donor's knowledge about AIDS, and donor's knowledge about donor eligibility criteria. Questions pertaining to sexual behavior and injection drug use were preceded by a short statement explaining their purpose, the need for truthful answers, and giving the respondent permission to avoid answering any objectionable questions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of the 50,162 donors sampled, 69 percent responded and 98 percent of the respondents answered all of the risk questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Analysis of the data revealed that 1.9 percent of respondents reported at least one behavioral risk that should have resulted in donor deferral. In 0.4 percent, this risk occurred in the prior three months. The results from this 1993 survey were corroborated by a similar anonymous survey by the same investigators sent to 92,581 donors in 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>These data demonstrate a low level of behavioral risk that is not eliminated by donor questioning, laboratory testing, or callback procedures. They support previous interview studies of HIV and HCV seropositive donors that showed that a high percentage of such donors will admit to a history of risky sexual behavior or past intravenous drug use that they had denied prior to donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]; similar behavioral results from HIV seropositive donors were also obtained in a study conducted between 2010 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, a study of seven American Red Cross blood donor history questions indicated that there is a continuing need for improving the clarity and comprehension of the screening questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, continued efforts to improve the sensitivity of behavioral screening appear to be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17575266\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL INFECTIOUS RISKS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031767684\"><span class=\"h2\">Viruses</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Screening issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In April 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a set of recommendations for screening prospective donors for prevention of HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These basic recommendations remained substantially unchanged until December 2015 when the FDA issued revised recommendations. The most substantial change was the deferral period for men who have sex with men (MSM) (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Deferral of donors'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The 2015 recommendations state that prospective donors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be provided with donor educational material prior to each donation that explains the risk of HIV transmission by blood transfusion and describes certain behaviors associated with HIV risk so that the donor can self-defer. This information can be in an oral, written, or multi-media format.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should be instructed not to donate if a risk factor for HIV (behavior) is present and should be asked direct health history questions about behaviors that put them at risk for HIV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should be instructed not to donate if they are at risk for HIV infection and if one or more symptoms that may be compatible with acute HIV infection are present. These symptoms include fever, enlarged lymph nodes, sore throat, and rash.</p><p/><p>Other FDA rules also require that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The donor should be told that all units of donated blood will be tested for HIV antibody and, if positive, the donor will be notified of the test result and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> name will be placed on a donor deferral registry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donors must sign an acknowledgement agreeing not to donate if the donation could result in a potential risk to recipients as described in the donor educational material; this includes the risk of transmitting HIV infection.</p><p/><p>Additional information that historically has been part of donor educational materials since 1992 is likely to remain unchanged at most blood centers. This includes the following messages to the donor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In early HIV infection, a donor may be infectious and capable of transmitting HIV despite having a negative test for HIV antibody.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing donors with specific information as to how to obtain an HIV antibody test at a site other than the donor center.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Deferral of donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2015 FDA recommendations have altered the deferral period for MSM in the United States. The revised deferral period is 12 months since the last sexual contact rather than an indefinite deferral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This policy change aligns the MSM donor deferral period with those for other behaviors that may pose a similar risk of HIV or other transfusion-transmissible infections. Several countries have similar 12-month deferrals, whereas other countries have deferral periods ranging from three months to indefinite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The specific information to be obtained from donors during the donor interview that will lead to a <strong>permanent deferral</strong> as a blood donor includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous positive test for HIV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ever using non-prescription injection drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ever having engaged in sex in exchange for money or drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ever receiving clotting factor concentrates for hemophilia or other clotting disorders (this latter deferral is for the safety of the donor based on concerns of potential post-phlebotomy bleeding rather than for the safety of the recipient with regard to potential HIV transmission)</p><p/><p>In addition to MSM activity, the donor should also be asked other questions regarding behaviors during the previous 12-month interval; a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of these questions will lead to a <strong>temporary deferral</strong>, which is removed 12 months after the last potential exposure. The donor should be asked if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> has had sex in the past 12 months with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A person who has a positive test for HIV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prostitute (ie, a person who has exchanged sex for money or drugs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A person who currently or previously used non-prescription injection drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women: a man who has had sex with another man</p><p/><p>The donor should also be asked if, in the past 12 months, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> has had or has been treated for syphilis or gonorrhea, received a blood transfusion, experienced an accidental needlestick injury or a blood splash to a mucous membrane or non-intact skin, or received a skin or bone graft or a tissue or organ transplant. The questions about blood or tissue exposures are designed to protect recipients not only against HIV, but also against other transfusion-transmitted agents. In addition, donors should be asked about tattoos or body piercings; these will not disqualify a donor if tattoos were applied in appropriately certified venues and sterile equipment (for tattoos or piercing) was used.</p><p>Two additional HIV screening procedures, published in other FDA documents are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1995, the FDA recommended that individuals who are inmates of correctional institutions and individuals who have been incarcerated for more than 72 consecutive hours during the previous 12 months be deferred for 12 months from their last date of incarceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1996, the FDA recommended that new direct questions on high-risk behavior be added in order to exclude donors who are at increased risk for HIV-1 group O infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These questions related to birth in Cameroon or surrounding West African countries where HIV-1 group O infection has been identified, to blood transfusion or medical treatment received in those countries, and to sexual contact with anyone who was born in or lived in those countries since 1977. This latter set of questions were only required for those blood centers which had not switched their HIV screening assay to a version of the test that has higher sensitivity for HIV-1 group O strains. Since all blood centers have done so, this question is no longer asked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>A preponderance of data has demonstrated that the theoretical possibility of long-term persistent HIV infection in the absence of detectable HIV RNA, HIV antibody, or clinical symptoms does not exist or is exceedingly rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that HIV nucleic acid cannot be detected in HIV antibody-negative individuals from high risk groups who are at risk for latent HIV infection.</p><p>Other data have shown that seroconversion for HIV is highly likely to occur within six months of HIV exposure; in studies in health care workers exposed to HIV infected blood by needlestick injury, the longest interval from exposure to HIV seroconversion was 213 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Moreover, since the time of these studies, improvements in HIV screening assays (such as the addition of screening for HIV RNA) have resulted in a substantial shortening of this interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Thus, HIV risk behaviors that can be defined as ending at a specific point in time (eg, sex with a particular person who demonstrated HIV risk behaviors or an accidental exposure to blood) should only defer a prospective donor until laboratory testing can definitively prove that the individual is free of HIV infection. Although the scientific data indicate that this is only a matter of a few months given the combination of HIV nucleic acid testing and serologic screening, the deferral period for these risk behaviors has been conservatively set by the FDA at 12 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Federal guidelines for preventing transfusion-transmitted hepatitis were established decades ago in the Code of Federal Regulations and subsequently revised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/3,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25-27</a>]. The regulations require the following deferral policies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons currently or previously testing positive for HBsAg are permanently deferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons with a history of close contact with someone who has viral hepatitis are deferred for 12 months following their last potential exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons who have received a blood transfusion are deferred for 12 months.</p><p/><p>Additional questions about receiving a tattoo or body piercing within the last 12 months have also been included on the donor questionnaire, due to concerns about hepatitis transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, affirmative answers do not necessarily result in deferral. Most blood centers will accept donors with body piercing, provided that the procedure was performed with sterile, single use equipment. Donors with tattoos or permanent makeup are deferred for 12 months after the exposure unless the application was performed in a state that has a regulatory body that licenses tattoo parlors. In that case, donor deferral is at the discretion of the local blood collection agency.</p><p>The definition of close contact with a person with viral hepatitis clearly includes sexual contact. However, other aspects of close contact are more problematic to define. The definition used by the Uniform Donor History Questionnaire (UDHQ) is living in the same dwelling; this implies the sharing of household, kitchen, or toilet facilities. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), this definition appears reasonable since HBV can rarely be transmitted from an acutely infected patient to a household contact, probably through nonsexual contact with body fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Data do not support similar transmission for hepatitis C and deferral is not required for sexual or other close contact with an asymptomatic hepatitis C carrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>As of 2016, there is no longer a deferral for a history of hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In Europe, an additional process for risk mitigation of viral hepatitis is a temporary (four- to six-month) deferral after an endoscopic procedure. A 2018 meta-analysis of 29 observational studies concluded that there is an increased risk of hepatitis B or C infection in patients who have undergone endoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the authors acknowledge that the quality of the data was very low and that the data were confounded, in that almost all of the cited studies that established increased risk did not distinguish whether the hepatitis infections occurred prior to or following the procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H324632609\"><span class=\"h3\">West Nile virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since 2003, blood banks in the United States have performed nucleic acid testing for West Nile virus (WNV) as part of their routine screening procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'West Nile virus'</a>.)</p><p>Based on data from transfusion-transmitted WNV cases occurring in 2002 prior to the onset of such testing, it was hypothesized that a question asking about the occurrence of fever and headache in the week prior to donation might provide additional protection against WNV transmission. Such a question was added to the donor history in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A subsequent evaluation of two years of data from donors with laboratory-proven WNV infection failed to find a correlation between these pre-donation symptoms and WNV infection. Consequently, this history question was eliminated from the donor questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As with other acute viral syndromes, a general donor history question about whether the donor feels well may elicit the presence of non-specific systemic complaints leading to donor deferral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112468552\"><span class=\"h3\">Zika virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus (the same virus family that includes West Nile virus and dengue virus). Infected persons are most often (80 percent) asymptomatic; symptomatic cases usually have a mild febrile illness that may be associated with muscle or joint pain, headache, retro-orbital pain, conjunctivitis, and skin rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, data from Zika virus outbreaks in French Polynesia and Brazil have shown that more serious clinical outcomes can occur, these include Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome and congenital microcephaly and fetal losses in women infected during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zika-virus-infection-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zika virus infection: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthropod-borne-encephalitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthropod-borne encephalitides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several cases of Zika virus transmission from transfusion were reported during the 2015 to 2016 outbreak in the Americas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. These cases were detected after a donor reported post-donation symptoms compatible with an arboviral illness that was subsequently diagnosed as Zika virus infection. The recipients with transfusion-transmitted-Zika have not developed symptoms attributable to Zika virus infection.</p><p>Several agencies have issued guidance to reduce the risk of transmission from symptomatic and asymptomatic donors based on the donor medical and travel history:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>US FDA</strong> &ndash; Concern over potential transfusion-transmission of Zika virus in the United States arose in 2016 due to the large number of Zika virus infections throughout the Western hemisphere outside of the continental United States and Canada, the possibility of a potential United States blood donor acquiring Zika infection while traveling to a Zika-affected area, the potential severe outcomes of this infection, and the observation that during the 2013 to 2014 epidemic in French Polynesia, 2.8 percent of blood donors tested positive for Zika virus RNA and in June 2016, approximately 1 percent of donors in Puerto Rico tested positive for Zika [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued guidance in February 2016 to reduce the risk of Zika virus transmission from blood transfusions that included a four-week deferral of at-risk donors, which includes persons who have traveled to an area with active Zika transmission (as defined by the CDC on their website <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsadTqEOxwzb4nAvk/gFzFslzWisih6gjiMid9z55bPRS&amp;TOPIC_ID=7950\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html</a>) during the prior four weeks, those with symptoms of Zika virus infection, and those who have had sexual contact with a man who has traveled to or resided in an area with active Zika virus transmission during the prior three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In addition, if this information is obtained after the blood unit has been collected, the blood center should quarantine and destroy the in-date blood components still in inventory. However, in August 2016, the FDA issued recommendations requiring individual donor nucleic acid testing (ID NAT) of blood components for Zika and dropped the requirement for Zika-related donor questions. As a result, such questions are no longer part of the donor medical history. Furthermore, in 2017 and 2018, the worldwide incidence of Zika infection decreased substantially.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>WHO</strong> &ndash; In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided a guidance document for national health authorities and transfusion facilities to use worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. For non-affected areas, recommendations include increasing collections from unaffected individuals in order to increase the supply of blood from these areas, and deferring donors with recent travel to affected areas for 28 days. For affected areas, recommendations include a 28-day deferral of donors with confirmed Zika infection, symptoms of Zika infection, or sexual contact with a man who has had confirmed or suspected Zika infection within the preceding three months. It is also suggested to consider stopping collections temporarily or quarantining collected units for 7 to 14 days to allow the facility to confirm that the donor has not developed symptoms.

If a donor reports being diagnosed with confirmed Zika virus infection, blood centers must inform hospitals of products collected and distributed within the previous 120 days and any in-date products must be removed from inventory.

Although donation centers routinely ask about these medications, which might interfere with platelet function and defer prospective platelet apheresis donors accordingly, there is no routine quality control testing of platelet function for platelet apheresis products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. This is due in part to the poor predictive value of in vitro tests for predicting in vivo platelet function.</p><p>This donation restriction is specific to platelet apheresis donors and does not apply to whole blood donors unless platelets made from that unit of whole blood will be the sole source of platelets for a given patient. This would only apply only to platelet transfusions designated for neonatal and young pediatric recipients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17575682\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticoagulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the discretion of the medical director, most donors are temporarily deferred (eg, for up to seven days) if they are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, heparin, or another anticoagulant. This is because of the effects of these medications on the therapeutic efficacy of plasma components as well as the potential for impaired hemostasis in the donor following the collection procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTECTION OF THE DONOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donors are asked questions about their overall state of health as well as specific questions about cardiac and pulmonary problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, donors with coronary artery disease, cardiac valvular disease, arrhythmia, significant cerebrovascular disease, or heart failure are deferred, as are donors with any active pulmonary disease impairing gas exchange.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donors who have undergone recent surgery in the absence of blood transfusion are deferred until healing is complete and full activity has been resumed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donors who are pregnant are deferred during pregnancy and for six weeks after delivery.</p><p/><p>Individuals with seizure disorders are able to donate, provided that they have had no seizures within the past 12 months with or without medications. This policy appears reasonable since there are no data linking the convulsive activity associated with seizure disorders to the convulsive activity that may occur secondary to ischemia from a post-donation vasovagal reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>The minimal age for donation is legally established by individual states in the United States and is either 16 or 17 years; donors who are legally minors need written consent of a parent or guardian. Most blood centers do not have an upper age limit for donation; this policy is based on studies documenting that individuals over the age of 65 who met all other donation criteria had no greater frequency of severe or life-threatening reactions and had lower rates of post-transfusion reactions than younger donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-medical-history/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Safety issues concerning apheresis procedures and those who make frequent donations are discussed separately.
