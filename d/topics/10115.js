This term has been broadened to include all conditions in which antegrade ventricular activation or retrograde atrial activation occurs partially or totally via an anomalous (or accessory) pathway distinct from the normal cardiac conduction system.</p><p>The classic form of cardiac preexcitation remains the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern, which is characterized by a short PR interval (less than 0.12 sec) and a broad QRS complex due to a delta wave. The anatomic substrate for WPW pattern is a band of myocytes, also known as the bundle of Kent, which bridges the fibrous atrioventricular junction (ie, a direct atrial-ventricular accessory pathway that bypasses the atrioventricular node). The electrocardiographic features are a result of premature and direct ventricular myocardial activation due to conduction over the accessory pathway that directly innervates the ventricular myocardium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy, pathophysiology, and localization of accessory pathways in the preexcitation syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome#H13260510\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiographic findings'</a>.)</p><p>Several other pathways have been postulated to result in cardiac preexcitation. However, most lack the histopathologic correlation that has been demonstrated for the WPW syndrome. The Lown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) pattern and enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction (EAVNC) share some common features and have often been considered to have a similar etiology. The mechanisms proposed to account for these conditions include more rapid conduction within the AV node (&quot;slick AV node&quot;) or as a result of a bypass of the normal AV nodal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69078 \">figure 1</a>). The LGL syndrome and EAVNC will be discussed in detail here. Mahaim fiber tachycardia, another non-WPW form of preexcitation, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mahaim-fiber-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mahaim fiber tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LOWN-GANONG-LEVINE PATTERN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Lown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) pattern is characterized by the presence of a short PR interval and normal QRS complex on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). This finding may represent a perinodal accessory pathway or enhanced AV nodal conduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74221\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74221 \">waveform 1</a>). This bypass tract or accessory pathway is known as a bundle of James. This pathway links the atrial myocardium with the bundle of His. Thus, there is a short PR interval but a normal QRS complex as ventricular activation is still via the normal His-Purkinje system.</p><p>Patients with palpitations who had a short PR interval but normal QRS complex on the resting electrocardiogram (ie, LGL syndrome) were first described in 1938 and then further evaluated by Lown, Ganong, and Levine in 1952 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The latter report consisted of a retrospective examination of 13,500 consecutive ECGs at a single tertiary care center. 200 subjects were identified with a short PR interval, most of whom had a normal QRS complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was significantly higher in these patients when compared with a control group with a normal PR interval (11 versus 0.5 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiologic properties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrophysiologic mechanism for the short PR interval in the LGL pattern is abnormal atrioventricular (AV) nodal function with normal His-Purkinje fiber conduction. There is a bypass of the AV node with a tissue pathway, known as a bundle of James, that enters the bundle of His. This accounts for a short PR interval with normal QRS complexes. The following abnormalities have been found in patients with LGL pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abbreviated AH intervals at rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortened atrioventricular nodal refractory times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal responses to rapid atrial pacing (ie, AH intervals remain constant as the rate of atrial pacing increases until there is failure of conduction, ie, block). This is due to the fact that unlike the AV node, the accessory pathway manifests all-or-none conduction (ie, the pathway either conducts or does not conduct, and there is no change in the velocity of conduction when heart rate increases). </p><p/><p>The first two represent abnormal AV nodal function while the third can also represent an accessory pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69078 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the description of the LGL pattern, it has been recognized that some of these patients have enhanced AV nodal conduction (EAVNC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although both LGL and EAVNC refer to a presumed abnormality in or bypass of normal AV nodal function, diagnosis of the LGL pattern is based upon clinical and electrocardiographic findings while diagnosis of EAVNC requires the following specific electrophysiologic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AH interval in sinus rhythm of less than or equal to 60 msec (normal 80 to 120 msec in most subjects)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1:1 conduction between atrium and His bundle maintained during right atrial pacing at cycle lengths below 300 msec</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AH prolongation &le;100 msec at the shortest 1:1 conduction when compared with the sinus rhythm value</p><p/><p>The definition of EAVNC was subsequently broadened by including patients who had increase in AH interval of not more than 100 msec during pacing at a cycle length of 300 msec compared with the value measured during sinus rhythm. In one study, the individual criteria for EAVNC were fulfilled in 20 to 50 percent of patients undergoing electrophysiologic study for the evaluation of cardiac arrhythmia or syncope; however, only 11 percent fulfilled all three criteria for EAVNC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H799228\"><span class=\"h3\">Caution with sympathomimetic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs that can increase the heart rate or cause atrial tachyarrhythmias (eg, sympathomimetic agents like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextroamphetamine</a>) should be used with caution in patients with LGL or EAVNC. While there are no data about the risk of any sympathomimetic agent and developing arrhythmias with LGL, there would seem to be similar pathophysiologic considerations as are seen in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Sympathomimetic agents would enhance conduction through the AV node (making an AVRT more likely), as well as change refractoriness of the atrial myocardium (making atrial arrhythmias more likely and hence conducted more rapidly to the ventricle as a result of the bypass tract).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiology of EAVNC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, patients with EAVNC have an abnormally short AH interval and an abnormal magnitude and pattern of response to decremental or rapid atrial pacing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With a progressive increase in the rate of atrial pacing, the normal AV node demonstrates a progressive physiologic conduction delay (decremental conduction) as manifested by increases in the PR and AH intervals (AV nodal Wenckebach) until complete AV block occurs. The progressive prolongation of AV nodal conduction time or AH interval with rapid atrial pacing has a protective role, limiting the ventricular response to rapid atrial rates in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.</p><p>In patients with EAVNC and LGL, different patterns of AH response to decremental atrial pacing (ie, increasing pacing rates) have been elicited (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63880 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/3-5,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to pacing may be similar to that of normal subjects, but the initial AH interval and magnitude of prolongation is less (type 1 response).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The may be an initial increase in the AH interval followed by a plateau phase and then a further increase in the AH interval at faster pacing rates (type 2 response).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 percent of subjects have little or no increase in the AH interval with incremental atrial pacing (type 3 response); this is the most abnormal response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be an initial flat AH response until very short pacing cycle lengths when marked AH prolongation occurs (type 4 response).</p><p/><p>The patterns of nodal refractoriness also differ. Most subjects with LGL pattern and EAVNC exhibit shorter AV nodal effective and functional refractory periods than control subjects but similar atrial refractoriness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/3,4,7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,12</a>].</p><p>The criteria for EAVNC are empirically derived, raising a question as to whether this represents a discrete electrophysiologic entity. In one study of electrophysiologic evaluation in 160 consecutive patients, 11 percent fulfilled all criteria for EAVNC; however, there was a unimodal and continuous frequency distribution for the three criteria for EAVNC and all of the criteria fell within the lower end of their calculated normal distribution curves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. No factor reliably distinguished the subgroup of patients with abnormally rapid AV nodal conduction. This suggests that the criteria used to define EAVNC represent one end of the normal spectrum of AV nodal function rather than identifying a distinct group of individuals with an abnormality of the AV node.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LGL PATTERN AND EAVNC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is significant overlap between these two conditions, they are diagnostically distinct. Since the patients in the original description of LGL were not studied electrophysiologically, the basis for the short PR interval and incidence of EAVNC in this group is unknown. Few studies have examined EAVNC in patients with LGL pattern, and most published data on the LGL pattern do not allow an incidence to be accurately estimated. In one study, the incidence of EAVNC (defined as the presence of all three of the above criteria) in a group of subjects with LGL was found to be 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but other reports found an incidence of less than 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>A short PR interval is not always found in patients with EAVNC since AV nodal conduction is only one component of the PR interval; in addition, conduction velocity does not necessarily correlate with AV refractoriness which is the limiting factor in the ability of the AV node to conduct 1:1. However, LGL and EAVNC share some common features and have often been considered to have a similar etiology. The mechanisms proposed to account for these conditions include more rapid conduction within or bypass of the normal AV nodal tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC-PHYSIOLOGIC CORRELATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little progress has been made in correlating observed physiologic responses with anatomic abnormalities in these syndromes. LGL and EAVNC probably represent one end of the normal spectrum of AV nodal conduction properties. This hypothesis is supported by the unimodal and near normal distribution of the PR interval and AV nodal conduction properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Nevertheless, it is impossible to exclude a distinct AV nodal bypass tract or an abnormality in conduction characteristics as the cause in some cases.</p><p>The proposed explanations fall into two main groups, anatomic and physiologic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic theories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One anatomic explanation centers around the proposed existence of a bypass tract or accessory pathway arising from within the atria and inserting into the low portion of the AV node or proximal portion of the His bundle. Such a pathway would bypass the transitional portion of the AV node which is largely responsible for conduction delay and AV nodal decremental properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69078 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/4,14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>James fibers &ndash; The existence of tracts of atrial tissue running from the atria and inserting into the low AV node (James fibers) has been well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These tracts are, however, present in all hearts and probably represent a normal part of the complex anatomy of the AV node. Their functional significance has not been established, but these fibers have been felt to be the anatomic basis responsible for LGL and abnormal AV conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brechenmacher fibers &ndash; Brechenmacher fibers (atrio-Hisian tracts) could theoretically be present in the patients with EAVNC who show no decremental conduction during decremental atrial pacing (type 3 response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; however there has not been clinicopathologic support for such tracts as the cause of the LGL pattern or EAVNC. The reported frequency of these tracts is 0.03 percent which is considerably lower than the expected incidence if they were to account for a significant proportion of individuals with abnormal AV nodal conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intranodal bypass tracts &ndash; The existence of intranodal bypass tracts would permit rapid conduction through the atrioventricular node, avoiding the usual decremental pathways.</p><p/><p>The fact that most patients with EAVNC show some degree of decrementation with incremental atrial pacing makes complete bypass of the AV node unlikely but does not exclude partial bypass.</p><p>The normal AV node demonstrates decremental conduction in which adjacent cells are unable to fully excite subsequent cells in the conduction pathway. This property is enhanced by a short coupling interval (ie, increased rate) between successive electrical stimuli. Decremental conduction within the AV node is clinically manifest as a progressive prolongation in AV conduction time with increased atrial rates, ultimately resulting in Wenckebach block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type I (Wenckebach block)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Decremental conduction is diminished in patients with EAVNC. This could be explained by abnormal tissue in the region of the AV node, such as functional myocardial fibers rather than AV nodal tissue. Alternatively, the usual arrangement of the cellular fibers and the relatively poor intercellular excitation coupling, which are responsible for decremental conduction, may be abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Decremental conduction is absent in patients with LGL as there is tissue which bypasses the AV node and the bypass tract does not demonstrate decremental conduction. </p><p>Another possible cause for the enhanced AV nodal conduction is an underdeveloped or anatomically small node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/4,8,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,19-21</a>]. The conduction properties of the AV node change with aging; infants and children are generally able to sustain more rapid conduction than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The basis of this may not be anatomic but related to autonomic tone. Accurate premortem measurement of AV nodal size is not possible, so correlations between AV nodal conduction properties and AV nodal size have not been performed in humans. However, the lack of influence of size on the conduction properties of the AV node in other species suggests that this factor alone is not sufficient to account for the variation seen among individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic theories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic theories suggest that there is either an abnormality of the intrinsic conduction characteristics of the AV node or disturbed autonomic tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/3,4,8,20,21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8,20,21,25</a>]. Supporting a physiologic basis is the observation that most patients with EAVNC do show some degree of AH prolongation with decremental atrial pacing, a feature not usually seen with atrioventricular bypass tracts. In addition, many of these patients respond to a pharmacologic challenge in a manner similar to those with normal AV nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/21,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26-29</a>].</p><p>Another theory is EAVNC represents conduction primarily over the fast pathway in patients with dual AV nodal physiology, thereby masking slow pathway conduction. However, the incidence of AV nodal reentry in patients with LGL or EAVNC is not appreciably higher than in subjects with normal AV nodal conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/3,10,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,30,31</a>]. Furthermore, in patients with EAVNC and dual pathways, both the fast and the slow pathways demonstrate enhanced conduction when compared with control subjects with dual AV nodal pathways but no evidence of EAVNC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This finding suggests that a generalized abnormality of AV nodal conduction exists in patients with EAVNC.</p><p>There is limited information concerning the role of the autonomic nervous system in patients with EAVNC. Although autonomic blockade may partially reverse the conduction abnormalities in these patients, rapid conduction is usually still present, suggesting that increased sympathetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduced vagal tone is not the sole factor responsible for this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction/abstract/20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ARRHYTHMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH LGL SYNDROME AND EAVNC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is uncertain if an abnormality in AV nodal conduction is associated with arrhythmia.

Although both LGL and EAVNC refer to a presumed abnormality in or bypass of normal AV nodal function, diagnosis of the LGL pattern is based upon clinical and electrocardiographic findings, while diagnosis of EAVNC requires specific electrophysiologic criteria measured during invasive electrophysiology studies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia occurs much more frequently in patients with LGL syndrome when compared with persons with a normal PR interval. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite evidence to partially support numerous theories, the precise mechanisms for the LGL pattern and EAVNC, as well as the anatomic and physiologic correlation, remain undetermined. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic-physiologic correlation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common mechanism for arrhythmia in patients with the LGL syndrome and EAVNC, accounting for more than 50 percent of cases, is a reentrant tachycardia due to either atrioventricular nodal reentry (AVNRT) or orthodromic atrioventricular reentry (AVRT) using an accessory atrioventricular connection. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia have also been described. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias associated with LGL syndrome and EAVNC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment of arrhythmias in the LGL syndrome and EAVNC is unclear, but radiofrequency catheter ablation appears to be a suitable and effective option for such patients.
