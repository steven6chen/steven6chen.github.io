There is a strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and an infectious etiology has been suggested but not proven. In addition, alterations in gut microbiota may be a contributing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Various animal models, including an HLA-B27 transgenic rat that may develop psoriasis, axial and peripheral arthritis, and colitis, are helping to shed light on this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis, particularly ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults, is discussed separately.

Patients with positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and no family history of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have a 1 to 3 percent lifetime risk of AS, whereas AS is 10 to 20 times more common in relatives of patients with AS, and the frequency is even higher in siblings of patients with AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].

Examples of presenting features include a swollen ankle, a sausage digit, or what appears to be recurrent tendonitis. Morning stiffness is common, especially in the affected joint or lower back, and is responsive to heat (such as a long morning shower) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p><p>Children with spondyloarthropathies initially may be misdiagnosed with recurrent sprains or strains since the onset of symptoms is often early in the second decade and frequently coincides with a period of increased physical activity. In addition, children may lack axial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extra-articular manifestations on presentation, with some of the features associated with the spondyloarthropathies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), only becoming clinically evident after the original presentation with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Over time, these children may develop definite sacroiliitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Enthesitis is present in approximately 66 to 82 percent of children with ERA or juvenile spondyloarthritis at disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The enthesitis also most commonly occurs in the lower extremities, specifically at the inferior pole of the patella, the plantar fascia insertion at the calcaneus, and insertion of the Achilles tendon at the calcaneus.</p><p>Approximately 10 to 24 percent of children have axial involvement (spondylitis, sacroiliitis) at disease onset, which most frequently presents as spinal or sacroiliac joint pain and stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/6,7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,14</a>]. Inflammatory back pain typically is insidious in onset, mostly worse at night, improves with exercise, and does not improve with rest. Some patients with sacroiliitis are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Others may present with hip or alternating buttock pain rather than back pain. Tarsitis (inflammation of the joints of the midfoot) presents as pain with movement of the foot, such as with walking or running. It is seen in approximately one-third of children with spondyloarthritis at disease onset and is more common in children with spondyloarthritis than other categories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Dactylitis is seen in some patients with reactive arthritis and psoriatic JIA.

Anterior uveitis, particularly acute anterior inflammation characterized by eye pain, photophobia, or conjunctival injection, may occur. Diverse skin manifestations (eg, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, psoriasis) and recurrent gastrointestinal complaints (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea) also may occur as part of an undifferentiated spondyloarthritis. A spondyloarthritis may also be the initial manifestation of a systemic disorder, such as IBD, psoriatic arthritis, or reactive arthritis, further signs of which include the skin and gastrointestinal findings noted above. Studies in adults with undifferentiated spondyloarthritis or AS suggest that IBD may be the underlying cause in selected patients, and it has been shown that many children with spondyloarthritis also have subclinical gastrointestinal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Oral ulcers can also be seen in patients with reactive arthritis. The presence of a psoriatic rash and nail pits may indicate psoriatic arthritis. A psoriatic rash may be also present in the setting of reactive arthritis. Genitourinary symptoms are suggestive of reactive arthritis.

Keys to proper recognition include a careful history and a complete physical examination, with a particular focus on the musculoskeletal examination, to detect one or more of the following exam findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoarthritis &ndash; Usually asymmetric and primarily involves the large joints of the lower extremities. Findings include swelling, tenderness, increased warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enthesitis &ndash; Most commonly at the patella and calcaneus. The primary finding is tenderness with palpation of the tendon and ligament insertion points. Other examples are Achilles pain and swelling if there is a retrocalcaneal bursitis or pain with walking due to a plantar fasciitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tarsitis &ndash; Pain or tenderness with movement of the midfoot that may be associated with arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial arthritis (spondylitis, sacroiliitis) &ndash; Inflammatory back pain may be accompanied by reduced anterior spinal flexion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The modified Schober test may be used to evaluate for lumbosacral spine involvement, particularly in patients who do not yet have radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F107609\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107609 \">picture 1</a>). To perform the Schober test, the patient stands erect, and the position of the fifth lumbar spinous process is marked by a pen. Another mark is made 10 cm above it in the midline, and a third mark is made 5 cm below. The patient then bends forward maximally without bending the knees. In normal individuals, the distance between the top and bottom points should increase by 6 cm or more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sacroiliac (SI) joints can be examined by direct palpation, compression of the pelvis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Patrick&rsquo;s maneuver, although these tests and the modified Schober have variable sensitivity and specificity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is present in 60 percent of children with spondyloarthritis and 90 percent of children with juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/9,11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,20</a>]. Although HLA-B27 occurs with an increased frequency in these children, the presence or absence of the allele cannot be relied upon to establish or refute the diagnosis. The rates of HLA-B27 vary by ethnicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many children with a spondyloarthritis have normal laboratory findings even in the setting of active disease, although erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and other laboratory markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and platelets, may be elevated in some cases. Anemia of chronic disease is sometimes present. Antinuclear antibodies may be found in the subgroup of psoriatic arthritis that is not related to spondyloarthritis but are not more prevalent in children with other spondyloarthropathies. Rheumatoid factor is usually absent.

As the disease progresses, radiographic changes may be seen in the in the sacroiliac (SI) joints, vertebrae, pelvis, and entheseal insertion sites. Early in the disease course, SI changes are more frequently seen at the iliac side of the joint and the inferior, synovial aspect of the joint. Radiographic changes in the peripheral joints are similar in appearance to those associated with other categories of JIA.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is significantly more sensitive in detecting early sacroiliitis than plain radiographs, and the earliest findings may include subchondral edema and periarticular bone marrow edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. MRI without gadolinium may be sufficient to identify sacroiliitis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although the presence of bilateral inflammatory sacroiliitis on MRI strongly supports a diagnosis of a spondyloarthritis, approximately half of cases of inflammatory sacroiliitis are unilateral. Infectious and oncologic processes may also present in the SI joints, usually with unilateral involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Whole-body MRI has been preliminarily assessed as a means of diagnosing enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and monitoring disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, additional data in children are required before this imaging study is incorporated into routine clinical care.</p><p>Ultrasound (US) with power Doppler may have a role in the diagnosis and monitoring of enthesitis in these patients.

Patients can develop joint damage. It is not yet known how earlier diagnosis and the early use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors may effect these outcomes.</p><p>A number of variables are associated with poorer outcomes. The presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is associated with refractory disease, older age at disease onset, sacroiliitis, tenosynovitis, an increased number of active joints within the first three years after disease onset, involvement of small joints of the lower extremities in boys, and overall unfavorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Other predictors of an unfavorable outcome include family history of related diseases, patient sex (female sex and poor long-term physical health status, male sex and reduced anterior flexion of the spine), a persistently elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), early hip or ankle arthritis, and high numbers of affected joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spondyloarthritis-in-children/abstract/32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,37</a>].

Diseases that can fall under this category in children include undifferentiated spondyloarthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated arthritis.
