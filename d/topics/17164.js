Complications of therapeutic apheresis are discussed separately.

Apheresis includes plasmapheresis (taking away plasma) and cytapheresis (taking away blood cells). We do not use the term &quot;pheresis,&quot; which is a shortened pronunciation (slang) for apheresis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasmapheresis</strong> &ndash; A general term used to denote the automated, selective removal of plasma. Plasma can be separated from the blood using centrifugation or filtration. Plasmapheresis is mostly used to collect plasma from a healthy blood donor for transfusion (ie, plasma donation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Plasma products'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Therapeutic plasma exchange</strong> &ndash; TPE, also called plasma exchange or therapeutic plasmapheresis, involves removal of patient plasma and replacement with another fluid (eg, allogeneic donor plasma, colloid, crystalloid). Plasma removed during plasma exchange must never be used for transfusion to another individual, according to regulations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Therapeutic cytapheresis (hemapheresis)</strong> &ndash; A term used to denote selective removal of abnormal blood cells (eg, sickled cells [erythrocytapheresis, red blood cell exchange]) or excessive numbers of cells (eg, platelets [thrombocytapheresis], white blood cells [leukocytapheresis]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dialysis</strong> &ndash; A diffusion-based treatment best suited for the removal of fluid or small molecules (eg, uremic toxins, some drugs) from the blood using a filter. Fluid is removed by filtration (convection); solutes are removed by diffusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma filtration</strong> &ndash; A technique that separates plasma from cellular components with a highly permeable filter (plasma filter) using a dialysis or hemofiltration machine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plasmapheresis with hemodialysis equipment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4201152\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763415\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale and benefits of TPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic premise of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is that removal of certain pathologic substances from the plasma will reduce further damage and may permit reversal of the pathologic process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60280\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60280 \">table 1</a>). The pathologic substance may be an autoantibody, immune complex, cryoglobulin, myeloma light chains, endotoxin, cholesterol-containing lipoprotein, or other substance. </p><p>The TPE process involves the removal of a portion or most of the patient's plasma, by passing venous blood through an extracorporeal device that separates blood into its components (ie, red blood cells, white blood cells, and plasma), shunts some or most of the plasma into a discard container, and returns most of the remaining blood to the patient, along with a short-acting anticoagulant (usually citrate).</p><p>Potential replacement fluids include the patient's own plasma from which a substance has been removed, donor plasma, colloid, or crystalloid. In some cases, use of autologous or allogeneic (donor) plasma is preferred because it provides needed proteins or other factors; however, donor plasma should only be used as replacement fluid for specific indications (eg, acquired autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP]). In other cases, use of appropriate non-plasma replacement fluid eliminates unnecessary exposure to donor plasma.</p><p>At least one of the following conditions must be present for TPE to be a rational therapeutic choice:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The substance to be removed should be sufficiently large (molecular weight greater than 15,000) so that it cannot be easily removed by less expensive purification techniques such as hemofiltration or high-flux hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The substance to be removed must have a sufficiently long half-life so that extracorporeal removal is much more rapid than endogenous clearance pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The substance to be removed must be acutely toxic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resistant to conventional therapy so that the rapid elimination from the extracellular fluid by TPE is indicated. </p><p/><p>TPE is highly efficacious for the removal of pathogenic autoantibodies. IgG has an average molecular weight over 150,000 and a half-life of approximately 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, even if immunosuppressive therapy could immediately halt new antibody production, the plasma concentration would only fall by 50 percent by 21 days. Such a delay is unacceptable with an aggressive autoantibody, such as that seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anti-GBM antibody (Goodpasture's) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TPE has other potential benefits, which include unloading of the reticuloendothelial system (thereby enhancing endogenous removal of circulating toxins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], stimulation of lymphocyte clones to enhance cytotoxic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and the possibility of re-infusing large volumes of plasma without the risk of intravascular volume overload.</p><p>The infusion of large volumes of donor plasma without volume overload is particularly important in acquired (autoimmune) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a disorder in which TPE using plasma as the replacement fluid is lifesaving. TPE works in this condition both by removing very high molecular weight von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers and autoantibodies to the ADAMTS13 protease, which cleaves VWF multimers, as well as by providing additional ADAMTS13 to the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For some indications, TPE is definitive therapy (eg, TTP, acute Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) whereas for others (eg, myeloma kidney), it may need to be combined with other definitive therapy such as chemotherapy to stop antibody production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3764246\"><span class=\"h2\">Common uses of TPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, most TPE procedures are performed for neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86468 \">table 2</a>). A collaborative survey by the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) and the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) found that more than one-half of all procedures were performed for neurologic conditions such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome or myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The Canadian Apheresis Group has reported a growing use of TPE for hematologic disorders, which constituted 55 percent of all therapeutic apheresis procedures in 2003; TPE for neurologic conditions had decreased from 50 percent in 1988 to 40 percent in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This change reflects the growing use of evidence-based practice and advances in pharmacologic treatments that in some instances replace TPE as standard treatments for some conditions.</p><p>The more common indications for TPE are discussed in separate topic reviews (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86468 \">table 2</a>).

The use of this complex and expensive treatment in the absence of supporting data prompted the development of guidelines based on better clinical data rather than only anecdotal reports or data from small series or uncontrolled trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86468 \">table 2</a>).

Appropriate lowering of the leukocyte or platelet count can be monitored by the complete blood count (CBC). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hyperleukocytosis, the post-procedure target white blood cell count (WBC) is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For thrombocytosis, the target platelet count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1,000,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>For RBC exchange, different parameters are measured depending on the purpose of the procedure. As an example, in sickle cell disease, exchange transfusion is often done using automated cytapheresis. This is monitored using the hemoglobin level and the percent hemoglobin S. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H13340862\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Simple versus exchange transfusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4201158\"><span class=\"h2\">ASFA therapeutic categories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive review of indications for therapeutic apheresis based on extensive literature reviews is published every two to three years by the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Conditions are divided into four main categories based on evidence of clinical efficacy reported in peer-reviewed literature. These guidelines are not intended to mandate TPE for conditions in which it is clearly not efficacious, nor are they intended to deny or exclude patients from receiving TPE when some benefit, although small, may be realized. Given the complexity and expense of the procedure, however, the guidelines provide a framework for clinical decisions regarding the use of TPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Category I</strong> &ndash; Category I includes disorders for which apheresis is accepted as <strong>first-line therapy</strong>, either as primary stand-alone treatment or in conjunction with other modes of treatment.

A publication is also available that describes the efficacy of TPE in some conditions and intoxications not addressed in the ASFA guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The value of the ASFA guidelines lies not only on the comprehensive nature of the literature reviews, but also the concise format for each listed disease state. Categories and recommendation ratings are given for each condition, as well as a succinct literature synopsis, evidence grading, and recommendations for the treatment schedule, replacement fluids, exchange volumes, and procedure frequency. Listing of conditions by category can be found in various references [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is most commonly performed with centrifugation devices used in blood banking procedures. These devices also offer the advantage of allowing selective cell removal (cytapheresis).</p><p>The use of a highly permeable filter with standard hemodialysis equipment is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plasmapheresis-with-hemodialysis-equipment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plasmapheresis with hemodialysis equipment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful TPE requires reliable venous access, which may be either two large, durable peripheral veins, or a central venous catheter with a dual lumen that is rigid enough to withstand significant flow and pressures. </p><p>Examples of products that would meet these requirements include, but are not limited to: the Quinton-Mahurkar catheter, MedComp apheresis catheters, and Hickman <span class=\"nowrap\">apheresis/dialysis</span> catheters. Radiographic confirmation of catheter placement is critical, especially for TPE procedures, to prevent perforation of vital structures and because cardiac arrhythmias may result if citrate anticoagulant (which binds ionized calcium) is infused close to the sinoatrial node.</p><p>Using peripheral veins may avoid complications associated with a central venous catheter, but is associated with slower blood flow and longer procedures; this may render peripheral veins ineffective or uncomfortable for some TPE procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19349295\"><span class=\"h2\">Exchange volumes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most conditions, it has become standard practice to perform 1 to 1.5 plasma volume exchanges per procedure. Exchange of the first 1 to 1.5 plasma volumes removes the highest volume of the target substance, with diminishing amounts removed with each subsequent exchange during a procedure. A single plasma volume exchange in an average-sized adult uses approximately 3 liters of replacement fluid.</p><p>In general, large molecular weight compounds equilibrate slowly between the vascular space and the interstitium. Thus, calculations of the rate of removal by TPE can be simplified to first order kinetics. A single plasma volume exchange will lower plasma macromolecule levels by 60 percent, and an exchange equal to 1.4 times the plasma volume will lower plasma levels by 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The following formula can be used to estimate the plasma volume in an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Estimated plasma volume (in liters) &#160;= &#160;0.07 &#160;x &#160;weight (kg) &#160;x &#160;(1 &#160;- &#160;hematocrit)</p></div></div><p>Exchanging more than one plasma volume in a single treatment increases procedure time, challenges patient tolerance, and increases the cost. As an example, cell separators can perform one complete volume exchange in 1.5 to 2 hours; two to three plasma exchanges will double or triple the time required to perform the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Replacement fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fluid volume removed by TPE must be replaced to prevent marked volume depletion. Albumin, saline, or a combination of albumin and saline are the replacement fluids of choice for most conditions. The optimal choice often varies with the clinical setting. Five percent albumin is used for most conditions; saline for hyperviscosity; and some combination of albumin and saline if cost is a consideration. We prefer 5 percent albumin or a crystalloid-colloid (ie, albumin-saline) combination as the replacement fluid, rather than saline alone. It is generally recommended that plasma only be used as the replacement fluids for conditions in which constituents of plasma are necessary for therapy (eg, TTP).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Five percent albumin</strong> &ndash; Albumin has the advantages of lack of viral transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and minimal risk of anaphylactic reactions. However, a post-apheresis depletion coagulopathy and a net loss of immunoglobulins can occur. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Albumin-saline combination</strong> &ndash; When colloid and crystalloid solutions are used in combination, the amount of colloid should not be less than 50 percent of the total infused. An appropriate replacement solution would consist of 1:1 ratio of albumin to whole blood and a 2:1 ratio of saline to whole blood, or 60 to 80 percent colloid and 20 to 40 percent saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Saline alone </strong>&ndash; Saline alone provides insufficient oncotic pressure and tends to lead to significant edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension. Thus, we prefer albumin or albumin-saline in combination. However, there may be medically compelling reasons for the use of saline in some cases (eg, albumin not available or complications such as allergies occurring with albumin or plasma).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma</strong> &ndash; Plasma can be provided in the form of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), Plasma Frozen Within 24 hours After Phlebotomy (PF24), Thawed Plasma, or other products.

As a result, only one or two procedures are usually required to rapidly reduce IgM levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>IgG</strong> &ndash; Only 45 percent of IgG is intravascular, and within 48 hours of a procedure the plasma IgG production returns to 40 percent of the pre-apheresis level. IgG production is also characterized by a &quot;rebound&quot; phenomenon, and cessation of TPE after several procedures can result in pretreatment or even higher levels of IgG, especially if the patient is not on immunosuppressive therapy. Consequently, a more rigorous regimen involving several TPE procedures and the institution of immunosuppressive therapy is required to significantly reduce IgG levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>If one assumes a negligible production rate of new immunoglobulin (due in part to concurrent immunosuppressive therapy) and that the rate of extravascular to intravascular equilibration is approximately 1 to 2 percent per hour, then five separate procedures over 7 to 10 days are required to remove 90 percent of the total initial body immunoglobulin burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Additional treatments may be required if new antibody production occurs.</p><p>The AABB general recommendation for conditions requiring TPE is that one exchange be performed every second or third day, each exchange consisting of 1 to 1.5 plasma volumes for, in most cases, a total of three to five procedures. Exceptions include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some conditions, such as acute Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, it may be necessary after the initial exchanges to perform TPE one to two times a week until improvement occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), TPE should be performed daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for Goodpasture's syndrome (anti-GBM mediated disease) is generally also performed on a daily or every other day basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anti-GBM antibody (Goodpasture's) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory assessment is based upon the desired endpoint of therapy and the number of procedures that will be performed. </p><p>For TPE performed without a plasma product, a baseline complete blood count (CBC), immunoglobulin levels, and coagulation and electrolyte studies should be performed. If a large number of closely spaced procedures are planned, subsequent laboratory evaluation should occur more frequently than would be necessary for a less aggressive course. </p><p>For a patient undergoing therapeutic cytapheresis, the appropriate cell count determines the adequacy of response. (See <a href=\"#H4782737\" class=\"local\">'Common uses of therapeutic cytapheresis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3915389\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis) is an extracorporeal blood purification technique for the removal of large molecular weight substances or cells from the plasma. (See <a href=\"#H4201146\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) to be a rational therapeutic choice, the substance to be removed should be sufficiently large so that it cannot be easily removed by hemofiltration or high-flux hemodialysis, must have a sufficiently long half-life, or must be acutely toxic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resistant to conventional therapy. Examples include pathogenic autoantibodies, immune complexes, cryoglobulins, myeloma light chains, endotoxin, cholesterol-containing lipoproteins. (See <a href=\"#H3763415\" class=\"local\">'Rationale and benefits of TPE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic cytapheresis (ie, removal of white blood cells, platelets, or red blood cells) can be performed in order to reduce excessive numbers of cells or pathologically abnormal cells; this may be used for hyperleukocytosis, marked thrombocytosis, or exchange transfusion (see <a href=\"#H4782737\" class=\"local\">'Common uses of therapeutic cytapheresis'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) guidelines for TPE are based on extensive literature reviews of TPE for multiple disease states. Conditions are divided into four categories based on evidence of clinical efficacy of TPE reported in peer-reviewed literature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86468 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4201158\" class=\"local\">'ASFA therapeutic categories'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful therapeutic apheresis requires reliable venous access, which may be either two large, durable peripheral veins, or a central venous catheter with a dual lumen that is rigid enough to withstand significant flow and pressures. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Venous access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fluid volume removed by TPE must be replaced to prevent marked volume depletion. Albumin, saline, or a combination of albumin and saline are the replacement fluids of choice for most conditions. Plasma is appropriate in some conditions that require addition of a missing plasma protein (eg, ADAMTS13 in acquired autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP]). For most conditions, it is acceptable to perform 1 to 1.5 plasma volume exchanges per procedure. A single plasma volume exchange in an average-sized adult uses approximately 3 liters of replacement fluid. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Replacement fluids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The apheresis schedule should be determined according to the pathological substance that is being removed, and by the desired endpoint. Only one or two procedures may be required to rapidly reduce IgM levels; a more rigorous regimen involving several TPE procedures and the institution of immunosuppressive therapy is required to significantly reduce IgG levels. (See <a href=\"#H251975\" class=\"local\">'Apheresis schedule'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of therapeutic apheresis are discussed separately, including hypocalcemia; depletion of coagulation factors, immunoglobulins, or medications; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-related symptoms; and adverse reactions to donor plasma such as anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and exposure to infectious pathogens.
