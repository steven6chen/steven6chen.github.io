From early in the HIV epidemic, it was clear that some patients rapidly progressed to AIDS while others experienced relative immunologic stability.</p><p>Laboratory measurements, such as numbers of CD4 cells and levels of plasma HIV RNA, are helpful in determining the stage of infection and may serve as prognostic markers. Other factors may also influence outcome.

The CD4 cell count and the viral load are independent predictors of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. This is illustrated by the following natural history studies prior to the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The five-year risk of progressing to AIDS in 522 injection drug users ranged from zero percent in those with a baseline viral load &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and a CD4 cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;500/microL</span> to 81 percent in those with a baseline viral load &ge;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and a CD4 cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study is a database of men who have sex with men (MSM) that was initiated prior to the availability of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After nine years of follow-up, 100 percent of patients with CD4 cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL</span> and a viral load &gt;55,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> had an AIDS-defining condition compared with 12.7 percent of patients with CD4 cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;350/microL</span> and a viral load &le;1500 by RT-PCR.</p><p/><p>In summary, a group of individuals with similar levels of viremia tend to lose CD4 cells at a faster rate than another group with lower levels of viremia. However, one study of more than 2700 antiretroviral-na&iuml;ve, chronically infected persons demonstrated that presenting HIV RNA levels only minimally predicted the degree of CD4+ T-cell count decline for the individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These data suggest that there are other unmeasured factors that contribute to CD4 T-cell loss. One potential variable is immune activation, which can be indirectly measured through flow cytometry (eg, CD38 and human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR markers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Proposed mechanisms of immune activation-mediated CD4 cell destruction include programmed cell death, bystander cell killing, and accelerated cellular senescence. Chronic immune activation may be expressed clinically by premature atherosclerosis and reduced longevity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients#H25650733\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of vascular disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-in-older-adults#H602296363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection in older adults&quot;, section on 'Immune activation'</a>). Contributing factors to immune activation are persistent viremia and residual virus in blood and sanctuary sites. ART, especially when initiated early in the disease course, reduces the HIV burden but does not eliminate it.</p><p>The risk of opportunistic infections increases as CD4 cell counts decline. Thresholds of various CD4 T-cell cutoffs are used to determine when prophylaxis for various opportunistic infections, such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, or <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) infection, should be initiated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>). In the era of potent ART, the three-year probability of developing AIDS has changed dramatically, even in high-risk groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62317\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62317 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">CD4 counts versus CD4 percentages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been debate about the relative merits of the CD4 count versus CD4 percent as a predictor of progression to an AIDS defining-complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. It appears that the CD4 count may be preferred with counts &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the CD4 T-cell percentages may be a more accurate marker of disease progression in patients with CD4 cell counts &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of 788 patients who took their first ART regimen, subjects were stratified by their baseline absolute CD4 cell count and CD4 lymphocyte percentage as derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The median CD4 lymphocyte percentage of 17 percent was used to compare disease progression within the absolute CD4 lymphocyte count strata. The study was significant for the following results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-six patients had discordant CD4 cell counts and percentages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among subjects with an absolute CD4 cell count &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> those with a CD4 lymphocyte percentage &lt;17 percent had faster progression to an AIDS-defining illness or death than subjects with a CD4 cell percentage of &gt;17 percent.</p><p/><p>Since the number of patients with discordant results was small, a subsequent study was undertaken in a large cohort of 1891 patients and demonstrated that the CD4 cell percentage at the initiation of ART predicted disease progression, independent of absolute CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For example, their model predicted that for a person with an absolute CD4 count of 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and a CD4 cell percentage of 9, the hazard of an AIDS-defining event or death was 65 percent greater than that for a person with the same absolute CD4 cell count and a CD4 cell percentage of 24.</p><p>The study involved mainly white men who acquired HIV infection through sex with men and gives increasing support for the use of both markers to guide clinical decision-making. In a study of 60 HIV-seronegative patients with cirrhosis, the absolute CD4 cell count was found to be low in 65 percent, most of whom had a normal CD4 cell percentage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This study suggests that, in HIV-infected patients with liver disease, the CD4 cell percentage may also be more informative than the CD4 cell count alone in assessing a patient's immune status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RATE OF PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of progression of HIV infection shows enormous individual patient variation in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some patients progress to AIDS within two years of infection. Others maintain low viral loads and normal CD4 counts for &gt;10 years without treatment (ie, &quot;long-term nonprogressors&quot;), and others have no detectable viremia without any treatment (ie, &quot;elite suppressors&quot;).</p><p>The average life expectancy for an HIV-infected patient in the absence of treatment is approximately 10 years. In the San Francisco City Clinical Cohort of 341 men infected from 1977 to 1980, 11-year follow-up revealed that 54 percent progressed to AIDS and 19 percent remained asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The percentage of patients developing AIDS (according to the 1987 definition) following seroconversion was zero at one year, 3 percent at three years, 12 percent at five years, 36 percent at eight years, 53 percent at 10 years, and 68 percent at 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Analysis of this same cohort showed that the mean survival time following a CD4 count of 200 was 38 to 40 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most rapid progression from viral transmission to death from AIDS was 28 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Multiple factors may influence the rate of progression of HIV infection as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Demographic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have demonstrated that increasing age at the time of HIV infection is associated with more rapid progression to AIDS in the absence of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In one series, for example, the median time from seroconversion to AIDS without therapy was 15 years for patients aged 16 to 24 years at seroconversion, compared with six years for those 35 years or older at seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Rates of progression appear similar by sex, race, and risk category if adjusted for the quality of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/21-23,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23,25-30</a>]. Multiple studies have documented modest differences in viral load between men and women, but the average time from infection to AIDS or death does not differ. An observational cohort study of 759 women on ART suggested that those patients with a history of pregnancy had a lower risk of HIV disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Calendar year of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An analysis was performed of 22 cohorts of patients with HIV infection from Europe, Australia, and Canada to study temporal trends in CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The risk of progressing to a CD4 cell count of &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> by 24 months after seroconversion was higher in patients who seroconverted before 1991 to 0.80 compared with those who seroconverted between 1999 and 2002. Hypotheses to explain this include emerging changes in the phenotype of circulating virus, leading to increased pathogenicity (eg, varying subtype distribution or emergence of a CXCR4 phenotype) (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'HIV subtype'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Coreceptor usage'</a> below). However, others have suggested that HIV-1 may actually be evolving to a less virulent form in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms during primary HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with symptomatic primary HIV infection tend to progress more rapidly than those with asymptomatic seroconversion (see above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral attenuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristics of the virus itself may also influence the rate of progression. A cohort of patients from Australia (one blood donor and eight recipients), infected with an HIV-1 strain with a deletion in the region where new and the long terminal repeat overlap, have been followed for 14 to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This HIV strain appears to be attenuated since three of the recipients have an undetectable viral load and normal CD4 cell counts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral fitness and replication capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral fitness as measured by replication capacity (the ratio of replication of a mutated viral strain to a wild-type reference strain) may influence disease progression. As an example, in 191 patients recently infected with HIV, patients with a replication capacity below 43 percent had significantly higher CD4 cell counts; only 6 percent of the variance in replication capacity was explained by drug-resistance mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In a study of 128 hemophiliacs with chronic HIV infection, the utility of measuring pol replication capacity for predicting immunologic decline and disease progression was assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Pol replication capacity was correlated with baseline HIV RNA and CD4 cell counts and independently predicted CD4 cell decline and progression to AIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spread of HIV-1 has been facilitated by rapid genetic diversification as the virus has adapted to the human host. Evidence suggests that cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from chimpanzees to humans has occurred more than once, giving rise to three distinct groups of HIV-1 called M, N, and O, although only group M has spread globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Some data suggest that the various subtypes (clades A to J) within group M may vary in immunogenicity, replication kinetics, patterns of transmission, and pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A small, but growing body of evidence suggests that HIV-1 subtype D may be more virulent than other subtypes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study in 428 pregnant women in Tanzania found that patients with subtype D experienced more rapid disease progression and risk of death compared with patients with other HIV group M subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 218 commercial sex workers in Kenya who were followed from the onset of HIV seroconversion for a median of 5.4 years, subtype D was associated with a greater than twofold increased risk of death compared with subtype A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 350 HIV seroconverters in Uganda, the median time to AIDS was significantly shorter for persons with subtype D (6.5 years) than subtype A (8 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Coreceptor usage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major chemokine coreceptors used by HIV to enter into human lymphocytes. Based on this coreceptor usage, HIV isolates are classified as CCR5-tropic (R5), CXCR4-tropic (X4), or dual tropic <span class=\"nowrap\">(R5/X4)</span> strains.</p><p>R5 viruses are generally non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) isolates that predominate in primary infection. R5 viruses are usually associated with a less virulent phenotype; these strains replicate in monocytes and macrophages and are also sometimes referred to as &quot;M-tropic&quot; viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. R5 viruses can also infect CCR5-expressing dendritic cells, which are responsible for trafficking of HIV particles to lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>X4 viruses generally are syncytium-inducing and often emerge later in infection. These viral strains frequently appear more virulent and are able to replicate more efficiently in T lymphocytes (&quot;T-tropic&quot; viruses). The emergence of X4 virus has been associated with the development of an AIDS-defining illness or a CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> compared with those with R5 persistence and slowly progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Studies suggest that treatment-experienced patients with ongoing detectable viremia have a greater risk of having <span class=\"nowrap\">dual/mixed</span> X4 tropism despite treatment-mediated gains in CD4+ T-cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Viral phenotype'</a> below.)</p><p>The reason R5 viruses predominate early on is unclear since CCR5 is expressed on fewer T cells than is CXCR4. R5 viruses produce 5 to 10 times more infectious virus per CCR5+ target cell than X4 variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and also appear to be more efficiently transmitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These advantages may contribute to the predominance of R5 in early infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenicity of X4 viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenicity of X4 HIV strains may be due to the ability of these isolates to infect thymocytes, the precursors of mature CD4 T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. HIV progression and viral replication has also been linked to the density of coreceptors on the surface of potential cellular targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Since X4 variants have greater cytopathicity, this phenotypic change is usually accompanied by declines in CD4 counts and clinical progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 402 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients, 76 of whom harbored X4- or <span class=\"nowrap\">D/M-tropic</span> virus, the times to viral suppression and CD4 cell increases were similar despite baseline differences in tropism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, a multivariate analysis demonstrated that clinical events were more common in patients with X4- or <span class=\"nowrap\">D/M-tropic</span> virus (relative risk [RR] 2.56, 95% CI 1.37-4.76).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of 126 children and adolescents with hemophilia, detection of CXCR4-using virus at baseline predicted a greater decline in CD4+ T-cell counts over time and was associated with a 3.8-fold increased risk of progression to clinical AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of CCR5-delta32 genetic background</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the gene encoding the coreceptor CCR5 are associated with decreased susceptibility to HIV infection and a more favorable natural history if infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. The CCR5-delta32 mutation is a 32-base pair deletion that results in a nonfunctional coreceptor. Individuals who are CCR5-delta32 homozygotes (ie, both alleles of the CCR5 gene are mutated) are highly resistant to HIV infection following exposure. CCR5-delta32 heterozygotes (ie, one allele is mutated but the other allele encodes a functional CCR5) remain susceptible to HIV infection but appear to have a slower rate of disease progression. In a large meta-analysis of 19 observational studies, CCR5-delta32 heterozygosity was associated with a decreased risk for progression to AIDS and death and was associated with lower HIV RNA levels after seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The CCR5-delta32 allele is common in whites but is almost never seen in Asians or Africans. The high penetrance of this mutation in certain populations suggests that, at some time point, this allele conferred a survival advantage. Candidates for this selection pressure include <em>Yersinia pestis</em> (agent of plague) or variola virus (agent of smallpox) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The critical role of the CCR5 receptor in HIV infection and disease progression is further highlighted by the case of an HIV-infected patient with acute myeloid leukemia who received two stem cell transplants from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor who was homozygous for the CCR5-delta32 mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. The second procedure led to complete remission of the patient's acute leukemia. Additionally, he discontinued ART following transplantation, and over 45 months later he was considered effectively cured of HIV with no active replicating HIV detected in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, or rectal mucosa, as assessed by RNA and proviral DNA assays.</p><p>Building on these observations, another novel strategy to control HIV infection has focused on the introduction of CCR5 receptor mutations into otherwise susceptible cells through genetic engineering. In a preliminary study, 12 HIV-infected patients with viral suppression on ART underwent a single infusion of autologous CD4 cells in which the CCR5 gene had been functionally knocked out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The infusion was considered safe, with only one transient (albeit severe) febrile reaction, and the modified CD4 cells persisted for variable times in the patients, with a median half-life of 48 weeks. Among the four patients who subsequently discontinued ART for 12 weeks, the median decline of modified CD4 cells was lower than that of unmodified cells during the treatment interruption.

The detection of SI HIV viral variants (also known as X4 variants, due to their usage of the CXCR4 coreceptor) is associated with more rapid disease progression than with NSI HIV strains. In a study of 225 HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM), 71 percent of those with SI variants progressed to AIDS over 30 months compared with only 16 percent of men without SI variants at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>It is not well understood why SI variants emerge in some individuals and not in others.

Common polymorphisms in TLR genes have been associated with an increased susceptibility to certain infectious diseases. In one study of 428 HIV-infected patients who were ART-na&iuml;ve, those with a rapid progressor phenotype had two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR9 that were in linkage disequilibrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

One genomewide association study of a nonprogressor cohort of 275 HIV-infected patients identified the presence of SNP, HCP5, as a genetic marker strongly associated with long-term nonprogressor status when compared with a control group of 1352 HIV-seronegative individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Some have proposed that genetic markers can assist in predicting whether or not an individual will be a long-term nonprogressor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. By a multivariate logistic regression model, patients heterozygous for CCR5-delta32, homozygous for SDF-1, and positive for HLA-B27 without HLA-DR6 but with at least three other HLA alleles (-A3, -B14,-B17, or -DR7) were correctly classified as long-term nonprogressors (70 percent) or progressors (81 percent). In a whole-genome association study, polymorphisms were identified, including HLA-B5701, which explained nearly 15 percent of the variation in viral loads seen among individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Compared with high-income countries, patients starting ART in low-income settings had lower CD4 cell counts (median 108 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> versus 232 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL);</span> however, this factor only partly explained these results. Concomitant tuberculosis and invasive bacterial and fungal infections may contribute to these results, due to limited access to prophylaxis and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The impact of antiretroviral therapy on morbidity and mortality of HIV infection in resource-limited settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic recovery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initiation of ART is associated with improvements in CD4 cell counts and function. The initial rise in T cells in response to treatment is related to an increase in memory CD4+ cells, caused by redistribution from lymphoid tissues, rather than by new T-cell production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].</p><p>An observational study evaluated CD4 cell count increases in 1835 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients who attained viral suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. The greatest increase in CD4 count (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> was seen in the first year after starting ART, but substantial annual increases were still observed five years into therapy. All patients starting ART with more than 350 CD4+ T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> at baseline achieved normalization of their CD4 counts over the period of observation.</p><p>The extent of the immunologic recovery may be affected by several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline characteristics that may contribute to immunologic recovery were assessed in the ACTG 384 treatment trial, which randomly assigned 980 patients to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a></span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a></span> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelfinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelfinavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Greater CD4+ T-cell recovery was associated with age of 40 years or younger, female sex, higher baseline <span class=\"nowrap\">na&iuml;ve/memory</span> CD4 cell ratio, higher baseline virus load, and viral suppression. Persistent T-cell activation was associated with lower CD4 cell recovery, even in subjects who achieved viral suppression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal study of 655 patients who were observed on ART, only patients with baseline CD4 cell counts &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> returned to nearly normal levels after six years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. There was no difference in CD4 cell gain in terms of hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus or specific ART regimen employed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinician expertise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ART brought new complexities to HIV care that have led to the emergence of clinician expertise as another important variable in HIV outcome. Several reports have documented a correlation between HIV patient panel size and patient survival and optimal use of antiretroviral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/120-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">120-123</a>]. This is one of the few diseases in medicine where clinician expertise has a documented impact on outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Persisting viral reservoirs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who respond to aggressive ART may have prolonged suppression of plasma viremia as indicated by failure to detect plasma HIV RNA. However, the designation of &quot;no detectable virus&quot; depends upon the assay used, which usually has a threshold of detection of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>.</p><p>In most patients with &quot;no detectable virus,&quot; there is viral persistence and there may be ongoing viral replication at lower levels in persistent viral reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. The main reservoir is the latently infected CD4 cell. In one study of patients with undetectable viremia for up to seven years, the decay of resting memory CD4 cells was found to be so slow that eradication would take an average of 73 years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p>Other HIV reservoirs include lymph tissue, genital tract, and central nervous system, all representing sequestered havens of replication competent HIV. Due to the different compartments with the potential for variations in drug exposure, HIV strains can evolve independently in the face of ART.</p><p>There appears to be little or no evolution of resistance mutations when the plasma viral load is &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">c/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. However, latently infected CD4 cells may harbor archived strains with previously established resistance mutations that are replication-competent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/148-150\" class=\"abstract_t\">148-150</a>].</p><p>This reservoir of non-evolving latent virus should be considered when decisions are made about possible termination of AR. Prior experience shows that viral rebound with high viral loads is noted in patients at two to four weeks, even among those with sustained viral suppression to &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> for prolonged periods prior to treatment interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/151,152\" class=\"abstract_t\">151,152</a>]. In the absence of therapy there may be reversion to wild-type virus, but resistant strains persist in the latent reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].</p><p>Researchers are actively investigating ways in which to purge virus from this latent reservoir, although no effective therapy exists at present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-affecting-hiv-progression/abstract/154,155\" class=\"abstract_t\">154,155</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two important laboratory determinants of the rate of HIV progression are the CD4 cell count and the plasma viral load, both of which are used clinically.

Some patients progress to AIDS within two years of infection. Others maintain low viral loads and normal CD4 counts for &gt;10 years without treatment (ie, &quot;long-term nonprogressors&quot;), and others have no detectable viremia without any treatment (ie, &quot;elite suppressors&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rate of progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most important factors in the rate of disease progression appear to be the genetic regulation of immunologic control of HIV and medication adherence. Other factors that adversely affect the rate of progression are older age, viral variants, substance use, nutritional status of the host, active tuberculosis, and possibly other forms of chronic immune activation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rate of progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of potent ART has dramatically altered the natural history of disease; however, viral reservoirs persist despite availability of potent medications, so the need for treatment may be lifelong once initiated.
