The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines define catheter-associated bacteriuria as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic bacteriuria (urinary tract infection [UTI]) </strong>&mdash; Culture growth of &ge;10<sup>3</sup> colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">(cfu)/mL</span> of uropathogenic bacteria in the presence of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI without other identifiable source in<strong> </strong>a patient with indwelling urethral, indwelling suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization. Compatible symptoms include fever, suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness, and otherwise unexplained systemic symptoms such as altered mental status, hypotension, or evidence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asymptomatic bacteriuria </strong>&mdash; Culture growth of &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> of uropathogenic bacteria in the absence of symptoms compatible with UTI in a patient with indwelling urethral, indwelling suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization. </p><p/><p>Patients who are no longer catheterized but had urethral, suprapubic, or condom catheters within the past 48 hours are also considered to have catheter-associated UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria if they meet these definitions.</p><p>Because periurethral contamination is less likely in catheterized specimens, a relatively low threshold for bacteria growth in a symptomatic patient is likely to represent true bladder bacteriuria. Although the IDSA guidelines acknowledge that growth as low as 10<sup>2</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> has been associated with bladder bacteriuria in the setting of symptoms, the threshold of 10<sup>3</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> was chosen since many labs do not quantify growth below that threshold. </p><p>In contrast, use of a higher threshold in asymptomatic patients is reasonable given the low rate of complications is this setting and the desire for increased specificity to reduce the overuse of antimicrobials, even if bacterial growth does represent bladder bacteriuria. (See <a href=\"#H123173127\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic bacteriuria'</a> below.)</p><p>These definitions are different from those used by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health Safety Network (NHSN), which were created for surveillance purposes, not specifically for clinical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The NHSN uses the same basic definition for asymptomatic bacteriuria but defines catheter-associated UTI as the presence of fever, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain in the setting of urine culture with bacterial counts &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> of no more than two organism species. The NHSN definition does not allow for other attribution of fever, so it may overestimate the rate of clinically relevant catheter-related bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The NHSN definitions also make attempts to distinguish between hospital-acquired and pre-existing UTIs in order to allow attribution to the institution where the urine was collected or to another facility. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123172539\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteriuria in patients with indwelling bladder catheters occurs at a rate of approximately 3 to 10 percent per day of catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

In the United States, based on surveillance data reported to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network, the incidence of catheter-associated UTIs in 2012 was 1.4 to 1.7 per 1,000 catheter days in inpatient adult and pediatric <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/surgical</span> floors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123172545\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of catheterization is an important risk factor for catheter-associated bacteriuria and UTI and is a major target of prevention efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Extraluminal infection occurs via entry of bacteria into the bladder along the biofilm that forms around the catheter in the urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Intraluminal infection occurs due to urinary stasis because of drainage failure, or due to contamination of the urine collection bag with subsequent ascending infection. Extraluminal is more common than intraluminal infection (66 versus 34 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Rarely, there can be purple discoloration of the urine, collecting bag, and tubing (the purple urine bag syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The purple color of the urine is due to metabolic products of biochemical reactions formed by bacterial enzymes in the urine. Gastrointestinal tract flora break down the amino acid tryptophan into indole, which is subsequently absorbed into the portal circulation and converted into indoxyl sulfate. Indoxyl sulfate is then excreted into the urine, where it can be broken down into indoxyl if the appropriate alkaline environment and bacterial enzymes (indoxyl sulfatase and indoxyl phosphatase) are present. The breakdown products, indigo and indirubin, appear blue and red, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Bacteria capable of producing these enzymes include <em>Providencia</em> spp, <em>Klebsiella</em>, and <em>Proteus</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123172590\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123172701\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causative pathogens in catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) and asymptomatic bacteriuria are similar to those that are associated with complicated cystitis in general. Specifically<em>, Escherichia coli</em> and other Enterobacteriaceae are common, but <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, enterococci, staphylococci, and fungi are also significant causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults#H12415021\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.) </p><p>As an example, of approximately 154,000 catheter-associated UTIs reported by acute care hospitals and long-term acute care facilities to the US National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) between 2011 and 2014, the most common causative pathogens identified were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> &mdash; present in 24 percent of cases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> spp (or yeast, not otherwise specified) &mdash; 24 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Enterococcus </em>spp &mdash; 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> &mdash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Klebsiella</em> spp &mdash; 10 percent</p><p/><p>Ambulatory patients with indwelling catheters tend to acquire urinary bacteria similar to those found in hospitalized patients rather than the types usually seen in the outpatient setting. Prolonged catheterization can be associated with polymicrobial bacteriuria or changing urinary flora. </p><p>Some of these organisms associated with catheter-related bacteriuria or funguria may lack some of the virulence factors that allow the usual uropathogens to adhere to uroepithelium, but they take advantage of easy access to the bladder via the catheter. A good example of such an organism is <em>Candida</em> spp, which almost never cause UTI in the absence of an indwelling catheter. In contrast, candiduria is a common finding in patients with indwelling bladder catheters, particularly in those who are taking antimicrobials or are diabetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, most patients are asymptomatic, funguria merely represents colonization, and progression to candidemia is uncommon (1.3 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This problem is discussed in detail separately.

Fever is the most common symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,25</a>]. Localizing symptoms may include flank or suprapubic discomfort, costovertebral angle tenderness, and catheter obstruction. Nonspecific findings include new-onset delirium or other systemic manifestations that suggest the possibility of infection. </p><p>However, many catheterized patients without evidence of UTI or even bacteriuria may have similar symptoms. As an example, in an observational study that included 89 hospitalized patients who developed bacteriuria following placement of a urethral catheter, 18 percent had a temperature &gt;38.5 C (101.3 F), 6 percent had dysuria, and 6 percent had urinary urgency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These symptoms were present in the same proportion of 945 catheterized patients without bacteriuria.</p><p>Patients with spinal cord injury may have especially atypical and nonspecific symptoms, including increased spasticity, <span class=\"nowrap\">malaise/lethargy,</span> and autonomic dysreflexia. Individuals who develop UTI soon after removal of a catheter may be more likely to have the typical urinary symptoms of dysuria, frequency, and urgency. </p><p>Many patients believe that a cloudy appearance or foul smell of the urine is suggestive of the presence of a UTI. However, neither of these findings has been demonstrated to be clearly associated with either bacteriuria or a UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. </p><p>Rarely, purple discoloration of the urine, collection bag, and tubing (purple urine bag syndrome [PUBS]) can occur due to metabolic byproducts of certain bacteria that may be present in the system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Risk factors include bacteriuria, constipation, and female gender. PUBS is benign and has not been demonstrated to have any implication other than the possibility of a UTI.

The frequency of low count bacteriuria in the setting of catheter-associated UTI is not clearly defined but expected to be very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>].

A UTI diagnosed in a patient who had a catheter removed within the past 48 hours is also considered a catheter-associated UTI. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Consistent findings may be specific to the urinary tract (eg, costovertebral angle tenderness) or may be more general, such as fever, leukocytosis, fall in blood pressure, metabolic acidosis, or respiratory alkalosis. If the diagnosis is based on such nonspecific findings, the evaluation should rule out the possibility of other infections (eg, bacteremia, pneumonia, skin or soft tissue infection) prior to attributing them to a catheter-associated UTI.</p><p>Because the symptoms and signs of catheter-associated UTI can be nonspecific, a fair amount of clinical judgment and individualization is required. As an example, although urine bacterial counts as low as 10<sup>2</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> have been associated with UTI without catheterization, the vast majority of patients with catheter-associated UTI have counts &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL;</span> thus it is reasonable to have a higher threshold for attributing nonspecific symptoms to a UTI in the setting of lower bacterial counts, particularly if the isolated organisms are not Enterobacteriaceae.</p><p>Certain findings, such as pyuria and the appearance or smell of the urine, should not be used to diagnose a UTI when found in isolation. Pyuria is frequently found in catheterized patients with bacteriuria, whether they have symptoms or not, and odorous or cloudy urine has not been demonstrated to be indicative of either bacteriuria or UTI. On the other hand, the absence of pyuria in a symptomatic catheterized patient suggests a diagnosis other than UTI. (See <a href=\"#H123172806\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123172917\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimen collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally urine samples for culture should be obtained by removing the indwelling catheter and obtaining a midstream specimen. If ongoing catheterization is needed, the catheter should be replaced prior to collecting a urine sample for culture, to avoid culturing bacteria present in the biofilm of the catheter but not in the bladder. </p><p>Many systems have a &quot;needleless&quot; site that can be cleansed prior to specimen collection. If a sample is being collected without catheter removal, urine should be obtained from the port in the drainage system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70120\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70120 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. For circumstances in which the above approaches are not possible, the culture should be obtained by separating the catheter from the drainage system. Although this approach is associated with some risk of introducing microbes into the closed system, culture results from urine collected from the drainage bag cannot be used to guide treatment.</p><p>In the setting of condom catheters, it can be difficult to distinguish true infection from skin and mucosal contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/16,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,30</a>].

Most patients with catheter-associated UTI come to clinical attention because of fever, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, or systemic signs or symptoms of infection in the setting of pyuria and bacteriuria; such cases are consistent with acute complicated UTI and are managed as such.

Bacteriuria in patients with indwelling bladder catheters occurs at a rate of approximately 3 to 10 percent per day of catheterization. Of those with bacteriuria, approximately 10 to 25 percent develop UTI. The most important risk factor is the duration of catheterization. Other risk factors include errors in catheter care. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever is the most common symptom of catheter-associated UTI. Pyuria is usually present. Localizing symptoms may include flank or suprapubic discomfort, costovertebral angle tenderness, and catheter obstruction. Nonspecific findings include new-onset delirium or other systemic manifestations that suggest the possibility of infection. However, these symptoms are not specific to UTI and may be seen in catheterized patients without bacteriuria. Pyuria is also common in catheterized patients with bacteriuria without UTI. (See <a href=\"#H123172806\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a catheter-associated UTI is made by the finding of bacteriuria in a catheterized patient who has signs and symptoms that are consistent with UTI or systemic infection and are otherwise unexplained. Consistent findings may be specific to the urinary tract or may be more general, such as fever, leukocytosis, malaise, or signs of sepsis. If the diagnosis is based on such nonspecific findings, the evaluation should rule out the possibility of other systemic infections (eg, bacteremia, pneumonia, skin or soft tissue infection) prior to attributing them to a catheter-associated UTI. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideally, urine samples for culture should be obtained by removing the indwelling catheter and obtaining a midstream specimen or, if ongoing catheterization is warranted, a specimen through a new catheter. When this is not possible, the culture should be obtained through the catheter port, not the drainage bag. (See <a href=\"#H123172917\" class=\"local\">'Specimen collection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial selection should be based upon the culture results when available. However, in some cases, prompt treatment is warranted prior to the availability of culture data. In such cases, empiric antimicrobial choice should be tailored to results of past cultures, use of prior antimicrobial therapy, community prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, and antimicrobial allergies of the patient. Urine Gram stain, if available, can also guide empiric antimicrobial choice. Depending on the clinical response, the infecting organism, and the agent used for treatment, 7 to 14 days of therapy is generally appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, patients with infection who no longer require catheterization should have the catheter removed and receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Patients who require extended catheterization should be managed with intermittent catheterization, if possible. If long term catheterization is needed and intermittent catheterization is not feasible, the catheter should be replaced at the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Catheter management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluating for asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters is warranted only in the setting of pregnancy or prior to urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated. For other asymptomatic patients with indwelling catheters, routine urine cultures and urinalyses are not warranted and treatment of incidentally discovered asymptomatic bacteriuria is not indicated. (See <a href=\"#H123173127\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic bacteriuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of unnecessary catheterization, use of sterile technique for insertion, and removal as soon as possible are essential to the prevention of catheter-associated UTI. Antimicrobial agents have no role in prevention of infection for the majority of patients with urinary catheters.
