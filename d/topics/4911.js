Such patients are referred to as having <strong>refractory hypertension </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence and characteristics of refractory hypertension were evaluated in a cohort of more than 550 patients with confirmed (true) resistant hypertension referred to a specialized hypertension clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Refractory hypertension was defined as the inability to achieve blood pressure control (by office or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) despite maximum tolerated doses of at least five antihypertensive medications, including chlorthalidone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>. The patients with refractory hypertension (approximately 3 percent of those with resistant hypertension) achieved a mean office blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">178/103</span> mmHg despite an average of six antihypertensive medications. Compared with patients who had controlled resistant hypertension, those with refractory hypertension had significantly higher heart rates (78 versus 69 beats per minute despite more beta blocker use) and higher systemic vascular resistance (despite greater use of vasodilators).</p><p>Based upon the persistently higher heart rates and lack of response to intensive diuretic therapy among patients with refractory hypertension, the authors suggested that treatment failure in such patients may be due to neurologic mechanisms (eg, sympathetic overactivity).

However, such patients may have pseudoresistant hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>True resistant hypertension</strong> &ndash; Patients with true resistant hypertension are those who have uncontrolled clinic blood pressure despite being compliant with an antihypertensive regimen that includes three or more drugs (including a diuretic, and each at optimal doses) and who also have uncontrolled blood pressure confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The prevalence of true resistant hypertension was assessed in 140 patients with uncontrolled clinic blood pressure who were participating in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of these patients, 69 were prescribed at least three different antihypertensive medications. However, 15 (22 percent) of these patients with apparent resistant hypertension had normal 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, 20 patients (29 percent) were nonadherent to therapy, and 3 patients (4 percent) were not prescribed a diuretic. Thus, only 31 (45 percent) of the patients with apparent resistant hypertension had true resistant hypertension. In addition, none of the patients taking a diuretic in this study were taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>, the preferred diuretic, and none were taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, which is effective in patients with resistant hypertension.

The five most common causes of pseudoresistance are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inaccurate measurement of blood pressure (eg, use of an inappropriately small blood pressure cuff).

Adherence to prescribed antihypertensive therapy in a large cohort of patients with resistant hypertension was determined by performing mass spectrometry of blood samples collected from participants enrolled in a trial of renal denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Overall, participants took an average of two antihypertensive medications despite being prescribed an average of four medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The importance of nonadherence to antihypertensive medications in resistant hypertension has also been identified in other studies. In one study, for example, 40 out of 76 patients with unexplained resistance to four or more antihypertensive drugs were determined to be either nonadherent or only partially adherent to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another study, 29 of 83 patients (35 percent) who had hypertension resistant to an average of four antihypertensive medications or who were referred for renal denervation were found to be nonadherent or only partially adherent when their urine was screened for antihypertensive drugs using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Among 468,877 patients included in an outpatient network, 44,684 (9.5 percent) had apparent resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of these, however, only 22,189 (one-half of those with apparent resistant hypertension) were prescribed optimal antihypertensive therapy (defined as a diuretic and two or more additional drugs, each at 50 percent or more of the maximal recommended antihypertensive dose). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-resistant-hypertension#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of resistant hypertension&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor adherence to lifestyle and dietary approaches to lower blood pressure, such as a reduced sodium intake.

A major problem is that not all patients with uncontrolled hypertension have resistant hypertension as defined above. Many are uncontrolled because of poor adherence or inadequate treatment regimens. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Resistant hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p>In an unselected, population-based sample of 15,968 adults in the United States, the prevalence of resistant hypertension was 8.9 percent among all individuals with hypertension (defined as a blood pressure &ge;140 mmHg systolic or &ge;90 mmHg diastolic) and 12.8 percent among those treated with antihypertensive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In selected populations of hypertensive patients who seek medical care, the prevalence may be higher, ranging from 12.3 percent in Spain to 16 percent in the southeastern United States when defining hypertension as <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;140/&ge;90</span> mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/13,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-21</a>].

The proportion of hypertensive patients receiving three or more blood pressure medications increased from 14 to 24 percent between 1994 and 2004.

Diuretics play a central role. Diuretics should be pushed until the blood pressure goal is reached or the patient has attained &quot;dry weight,&quot; which, in the presence of persistent hypertension, is defined as the weight at which further fluid loss leads to either symptoms (fatigue, orthostatic hypotension) or decreased tissue perfusion as evidenced by an otherwise unexplained elevation in the blood urea nitrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum creatinine concentration.

In three series of patients with resistant hypertension who were referred for sleep studies, significant obstructive sleep apnea was detected in 71 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>] and, in one, was significantly more common than in patients with controlled hypertension (71 versus 38 percent, adjusted odds ratio 4.8, 95% CI 2.0-11.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The severity of sleep apnea correlates with the severity of hypertension, and both the incidence and severity of sleep apnea were greater in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>].</p><p>Based upon such observations, we suggest screening for obstructive sleep apnea in patients with resistant hypertension who have one or more of the following risk factors: obesity, loud snoring, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> daytime sleepiness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure provides a usually modest antihypertensive benefit among patients with hypertension. The effect in resistant hypertension has not been well-studied.

To avoid falsely-high readings, it is particularly important to have the patient sit quietly for three to five minutes before taking the measurement, to use the correct cuff size (the adult large cuff for the majority of patients with resistant hypertension), and to support the arm at heart level during measurement. The blood pressure should be measured in both arms, with the arm with the higher pressure being used to make future measurements.</p><p>These and other components of blood pressure measurement are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, some patients have pseudoresistant hypertension due to errors in blood pressure measurement or white coat hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Apparent, true, and pseudoresistant hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinical findings that should raise suspicion of white coat hypertension include poorly-controlled office hypertension without evidence of end-organ damage (such as left ventricular hypertrophy on an echocardiogram) or symptoms suggestive of hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. On the other hand, true resistant hypertension is likely when the office systolic pressure is &ge;180 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the patient has echocardiographic or electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This is best accomplished with 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, although home and workplace assessments can be utilized if one is confident that the blood pressure is being measured accurately. We believe that ambulatory measurements should ideally be attained in all patients with resistant hypertension.</p><p>If out-of-office readings are at or below the desired target while office readings remain elevated, home or office readings may be used to guide medication adjustments. In addition to out-of-office measurements, the acute increase in office blood pressure can be minimized by having a nurse or technician take the blood pressure rather than the doctor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73781\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73781 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Ambulatory monitoring is also a better predictor than office blood pressure measurements of cardiovascular morbidity (ie, end-organ damage) and mortality in patients with resistant hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-resistant-hypertension#H20860138\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of resistant hypertension&quot;, section on 'Out-of-office blood pressure monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Cuff inflation hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A possible problem with self-measurement using a sphygmomanometer is that the muscular activity used to inflate the cuff can acutely raise the blood pressure by as much as <span class=\"nowrap\">12/9</span> mmHg, an effect called cuff inflation hypertension that dissipates within 5 to 20 seconds (average 7 seconds in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thus, inflating the cuff to at least 30 mmHg above systolic and then allowing the sphygmomanometer to fall no more than 2 to 3 mmHg per heartbeat is desirable both for accurate measurement and to permit this exertional effect to disappear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This problem can be avoided with automated home blood pressure devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER COMPONENTS OF EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of patients with suspected resistant hypertension should confirm true treatment resistance, identify contributing factors including secondary causes of hypertension, and document target-organ damage including retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and kidney disease.</p><p>Pseudoresistance is excluded by an assessment of treatment adherence and the accurate determination of blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Apparent, true, and pseudoresistant hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history should document age of onset, duration, severity, and progression of the hypertension. Current medication use (including herbal and over-the-counter medications) and the response to prior medications should be determined. Patient adherence is established mostly by self-report. The clinician should ask about adverse effects of medications, out-of-pocket costs, and dosing inconvenience, all of which can limit adherence.</p><p>The patient should also be questioned about possible manifestations of secondary causes of hypertension, such as pheochromocytoma and Cushing's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include careful measurement of the blood pressure and funduscopic examination looking for retinopathy. In addition, signs that suggest secondary causes of hypertension may be present. As examples, carotid, abdominal, or femoral bruits suggest atherosclerotic disease and possible renal artery stenosis. Diminished femoral pulses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a discrepancy between arm and thigh blood pressures suggest aortic coarctation or significant aortoiliac disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta#H1088178828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure and pulses'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing in patients with resistant hypertension includes measurement of serum electrolytes, glucose, and creatinine as well as a urinalysis with estimation of proteinuria (eg, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio).</p><p>Screening for primary aldosteronism is also warranted since, in the largest published experience of 1616 patients with resistant hypertension, 11 percent fulfilled criteria for primary aldosteronism, only 46 percent of whom were hypokalemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Primary aldosteronism'</a> above.)</p><p>Screening for primary aldosteronism begins with a paired morning measurement of the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) to determine whether the patient has an elevated or high-normal PAC, suppressed PRA, and elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio. Certain antihypertensive drugs can alter the ratio, some of which should be discontinued prior to testing. If the ratio suggests primary aldosteronism, further evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;, section on 'Plasma aldosterone to renin ratio'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;, section on 'Protocol'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to blood testing, a 24-hour urine collection should be obtained on the patient's usual diet for determination of sodium excretion, creatinine clearance, and aldosterone excretion. Urinary sodium excretion permits estimation of dietary sodium intake unless the patient has been recently (within the past two weeks) started on a diuretic or there has been a recent dose increase.</p><p>Patients with resistant hypertension should be evaluated for pheochromocytoma if they have suggestive manifestations such as episodic hypertension, palpitations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diaphoresis, or tremor.

This is particularly important in patients with known atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds, including peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease, an abdominal bruit, a rise in serum creatinine after initiation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or onset of hypertension at a young age, which could represent fibromuscular dysplasia.</p><p>Among patients with resistant hypertension who have none of these risk factors, we delay screening for renovascular disease until the remainder of the evaluation for resistant hypertension is negative. The preferred methods of screening are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of low specificity, imaging studies should not be performed to screen for adrenal adenomas in the absence of biochemical evidence of hormonally-active tumors.

One of the medications should be a diuretic, if tolerated, and all should be prescribed at optimal doses. Approximately 3 percent of patients with resistant hypertension cannot be controlled (called refractory hypertension) despite maximal medical therapy.

Less common identifiable causes of resistant hypertension include pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, and aortic coarctation. Screening for one of these disorders should only be performed if the patient has suggestive manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Secondary causes of hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation should include measurement of serum electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen and creatinine, and a urinalysis.
