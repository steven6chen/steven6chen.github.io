The majority of traumatic bladder injuries have a blunt etiology and are highly associated with a concomitant pelvic fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-and-iatrogenic-bladder-injury#H1912741047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic and iatrogenic bladder injury&quot;, section on 'Associated injuries'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-and-iatrogenic-bladder-injury#H611713594\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic and iatrogenic bladder injury&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethra &ndash; Injuries to the urethra are classified anatomically as affecting the anterior urethra or affecting the posterior urethra. The etiology of injury differs for each portion of the urethra; however, young males are predominantly affected for both. Posterior urethral injuries (men, women) are highly associated with concomitant blunt pelvic fracture, most typically due to motor vehicle accidents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, posterior urethral injuries are overall uncommon, with an incidence of approximately 1 percent. Concomitant bladder injuries are present in 15 percent of such urethral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior urethral injuries and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Direct trauma is more likely to injure the anterior urethra. Concomitant anterior urethral injury also occurs with approximately 20 percent of penile fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External genitalia &ndash; Injuries to the male external genitalia can involve the penis, corpora cavernosa, urethra, scrotum, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> testicle(s). The etiologies of injury to the external genitalia are heterogeneous, including blunt trauma (degloving injury, straddle injury, testicular rupture, zipper injury, penile fracture), penetrating injury (gunshot, stab, animal bites, penile amputation), and burn injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isolated blunt injury to the female external genitalia is unusual and may indicate sexual assault.

The initial resuscitation and evaluation of the patient with blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma is discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The initial evaluation of abdominal trauma commonly uses focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST exam) and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The FAST exam is useful in hemodynamically unstable patients to identify the immediate need for abdominal exploration. However, it is difficult to differentiate blood from other fluids, such as urine, with ultrasound. When free fluid is identified, the presence of blood is assumed until proven otherwise.</p><p>Bladder drainage is an essential aspect of the acute management of a suspected lower genitourinary (GU) tract injury. However, blind passage of a catheter during the initial evaluation prior to genitourinary imaging is discouraged unless clinical urgency dictates otherwise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3271335711\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary and secondary survey should identify individuals with findings suggestive of lower genitourinary (GU) tract injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-trauma-of-the-upper-and-lower-genitourinary-tract-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating trauma of the upper and lower genitourinary tract: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic imaging is recommended for almost all forms of GU trauma to confirm and grade the injury. Both computed tomographic (CT) cystography and <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> CT are often necessary following pelvic trauma. In such a situation, CT cystogram should be performed after the corticomedullary phase (to assess possible kidney injury) or the arterial phase (to assess other injuries). Waiting will prevent extravasated bladder contrast from obscuring vascular injuries that may benefit from urgent angioembolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For patients requiring exploratory laparotomy in whom injury is either not identified or exploration of the pelvis was not possible, imaging can be performed postoperatively. </p><p>The most relevant clinical and diagnostic imaging findings are summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder injury &ndash; Gross hematuria, suprapubic tenderness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficulty voiding are the main signs associated with bladder injury. Other clinical presentations include peritonitis related to intraperitoneal leakage of urine. Retrograde cystography demonstrating extravasation of contrast from the bladder confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-and-iatrogenic-bladder-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic and iatrogenic bladder injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethral injury &ndash; Clinical features associated with a urethral injury include blood at the meatus, difficulty voiding, <span class=\"nowrap\">scrotal/perineal</span> ecchymosis, scrotal hematoma, pelvic fracture, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a high-riding prostate in men. Retrograde urethrography demonstrating extravasation of contrast from the urethra confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-urethral-injuries-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior urethral injuries and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External genitalia </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Men &ndash; Clinical inspection of the external genitalia is generally all that is required to determine the extent of trauma; imaging is used primarily to identify any associated urethral injury. A retrograde urethrogram is recommended following penetrating injury to the penis to rule out an associated urethral injury. Following blunt trauma, the clinical presentation determines the need for further imaging. When there are clinical findings suggestive of <span class=\"nowrap\">testicle/epididymal</span> injury, ultrasound can be useful in the absence of obvious penetration of the tunica albuginea or dartos fascia on initial examination. Following a diagnosis of a penile fracture, urethrography or urethroscopy is recommended because of the high association with anterior urethral injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women &ndash; Bruising, linear tears, or abrasions affecting the mons, clitoris, or labia prompt closer evaluation for GU injury. Hematuria, vaginal bleeding, or pain are other important physical exam findings. Trauma to the lower genital tract in women, including injuries sustained from sexual assault, is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Rectal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal injuries in the setting of a pelvic-fracture-associated urethral injury should also be assessed given the risk of concomitant injury. Urology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gynecology consultation can be helpful to assist with the evaluation. A digital rectal exam can be performed at the initial presentation to assess for rectal injury; however, a pelvic exam to assess for vaginal injury should be delayed if the pelvic fracture is unstable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe pelvic fracture in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686023045\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) injury scoring scales are commonly used for defining solid organ injury, these may be less useful for defining an approach to management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The AAST grading system for bladder injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110270\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110270 \">table 1</a>) is difficult to implement clinically. Bladder injury is best simply described as intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal without regard to size. Urethral injuries are classified anatomically as affecting the anterior versus posterior urethra and further classified as partial or complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Bladder neck injuries and posterior urethral injuries that involve the rectum or vagina are regarded as complex. A simple description of injury to the external genitalia, which may include injury to the anterior urethra, is usually sufficient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2830318188\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following trauma, lower GU tract injury needs to be distinguished from upper GU tract injury (ie, bladder, urethra), particularly since both are associated with hematuria. Often the mechanism of injury or penetrating injury tract will aid with increasing or decreasing suspicion of one over the other. Imaging studies will identify the origin of the injury, though at times both the upper and lower GU tract may have suffered injury, more likely in association with pelvic fracture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607164834\"><span class=\"h1\">COORDINATION OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management strategy of urinary drainage following pelvic-fracture-associated urethral injuries is controversial. When considering open reduction and internal fixation of pelvic fractures, orthopedic surgeons can be reluctant to perform internal fixation in the setting of a suprapubic tube. </p><p>Urotrauma guidelines from the American Urological Association assert that either urethral catheter drainage or suprapubic catheter drainage is an acceptable method to drain the bladder following pelvic-fracture-associated urethral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This statement was based upon two papers; however, neither study was designed to resolve this issue. The first article did not assess the incidence of suprapubic catheter morbidity in the setting of concomitant pelvic fracture fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The other study did not assess whether suprapubic catheter presence affected pelvic fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Instead, the authors of the later article noted that recovery from pelvic fracture was delayed when only a suprapubic catheter (instead of a urethral catheter) was placed. No attempt was made to assess if the desired orthopedic procedures could have been performed in the setting of a suprapubic tube. </p><p>To maximally benefit the patient, working closely with the orthopedic surgeons is important to create a comprehensive management plan. If there is a concern that the suprapubic tube placement may secondarily infect internally fixed fractures of the anterior pelvis, we favor endoscopic realignment of the urethra for this particular circumstance to facilitate internal fixation. An alternative to endoscopic realignment includes tunneling the suprapubic catheter tract more superiorly toward the umbilicus.

However, there are clinical situations (ie, complex injuries) that dictate surgical management of extraperitoneal bladder injury.

In the setting of pelvic fracture, pelvic hematoma can push the bladder more cephalad than expected. Ultrasound guidance can be used to ensure correct placement of the suprapubic tube. Early endoscopic realignment of the urethra is an option for select circumstances. As an example, when internal fixation of a pubic fracture is planned, potential infection of internally placed hardware is a concern in the setting of a suprapubic tube, and endoscopic alignment may be considered. Alternatively, an external fixator can be placed alongside the suprapubic tube if endoscopic realignment is not possible. The definitive success of early endoscopic realignment of the urethra is generally poor, and suprapubic catheter placement should be performed (if not already in place) at the time of urethral catheter removal due to high rates of urethral stricture progression (approximately 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H607164834\" class=\"local\">'Coordination of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At our center, the urethral catheter is not removed until after a minimum of two months following repair and after urethral extravasation has resolved. The patient can then be followed with the suprapubic catheter in place with a plan for delayed open reconstruction. Referral to a reconstructive center for reconstruction should be considered following acute management of a posterior urethral injury.

If a catheter is unable to be placed, cystoscopy can be used as an aid. Suprapubic catheter drainage with delayed urethral reconstruction is an option following complete anterior urethral disruption. </p><p>Penetrating urethral injuries and blunt urethral injury with persistent bleeding (ie, straddle injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114626 \">picture 1</a>)) are examples of anterior urethral injuries that may require open exploration with repair.

Repeat imaging is recommended prior to catheter removal to ensure that bladder or urethral healing has occurred, regardless of whether the injury was managed conservatively or required surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2695405779\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H607164834\" class=\"local\">'Coordination of care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3950636962\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of lower GU tract injuries is according to anatomic injury classification and depends on the location of the injury and the nature of associated injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F115817\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115817 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3950636962\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1861388182\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and injury associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extraperitoneal bladder injuries are predominately managed in a nonoperative fashion, while intraperitoneal bladder injuries warrant surgical repair. Complex injuries, which include bladder neck injury, or those associated with pelvic fracture or rectal or vaginal injury necessitate surgical management. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute management of most urethral injuries involves bladder drainage with or without delayed repair. For patients with posterior urethral injury, early endoscopic realignment of the urethra is an option for select circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Soft tissue injury without penetration of the tunica albuginea of the corporal bodies or the dartos fascia of the scrotum can be usually be managed nonoperatively; otherwise, exploration and repair are required. If penetration cannot be easily determined on clinical examination, penile or scrotal ultrasound can be useful. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality associated with lower GU tract injury is primarily related to bleeding from associated pelvic fractures.
