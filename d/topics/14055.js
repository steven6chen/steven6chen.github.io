These factors are critical determinants of metabolically healthy versus metabolically compromised severe obesity. Although BMI is easy to obtain and therefore used universally to categorize severity of obesity, including in outcome studies, indices other than BMI (eg, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference, and percent body fat) may more accurately predict metabolic health and comorbid conditions, and may also better stratify perioperative risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-medical-evaluation-of-the-obese-patient/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2063068\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the usual preanesthesia evaluation, we focus the evaluation for obese patients on conditions that are more prevalent in the obese population, require optimization, may affect the decision to operate, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> could affect anesthesia care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76866 \">figure 1</a>).

This novel concept includes shared decision-making among the patient and various medical caregivers, from the decision for surgery through discharge and recovery.

All patients, including those with obesity, should be specifically screened for OSA and sleep-related breathing disorders preoperatively, as these disorders often go undiagnosed. Screening should include the use of a screening tool (eg, STOP-Bang (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87572 \">table 1</a>) or Berlin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91571 \">table 2</a>) questionnaires) and assessment for clinical features of OSA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 3</a>). For patients who screen positive, serum bicarbonate should be measured. An elevated serum bicarbonate increases the specificity of OSA screening tools, and may indicate carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention, which can be associated with sleep-related breathing disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-medical-evaluation-of-the-obese-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Patients with obesity and a strong clinical suspicion of OHS who are to undergo moderate or high-risk surgery should be screened for CO<sub>2</sub> retention and hypoxemia with serum electrolytes and arterial blood gases. An echocardiogram to assess global cardiac function, pulmonary hypertension, and specifically right heart function is suggested by some experts, including the author, for patients with clinical signs of OHS and CO<sub>2</sub> retention.
