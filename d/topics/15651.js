In the United States, approximately 40 percent of women have sexual concerns and 12 percent report distressing sexual problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Female sexual dysfunction takes different forms, including lack of sexual desire, impaired arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, pain with sexual activity, or a combination of these issues. Treatment must be tailored to the sexual dysfunction diagnosis or diagnoses and to underlying physical and psychological factors.</p><p>The management of female sexual dysfunction will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation of female sexual dysfunction and evaluation and treatment of sexual pain disorders are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of female orgasmic disorder are also described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the woman with sexual pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of sexual pain in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female orgasmic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of female orgasmic disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Female sexual dysfunction is multifactorial, often with several different etiologies contributing to the problem. Nonetheless, careful evaluation and use of available therapies can improve sexual function for many women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete the evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluate the patient for all sexual issues and associated physical or psychological factors before starting treatment. Most women with sexual complaints have issues that impact more than one phase of the normal sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, orgasm) or may complain of a general decrease in sexual satisfaction. As an example, if a woman complains of decreased libido, a full evaluation may also reveal issues with arousal or pain. We restrict use of pharmacologic therapy to women who meet diagnostic criteria for a sexual disorder and for whom non-pharmacologic interventions have proven ineffective. A sexual disorder is defined as a sexual problem that is persistent or recurrent and causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. It must not be better accounted for by a general medical or psychiatric condition (ie, anxiety and depression) or due exclusively to the direct physiologic effects of a substance or medication (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, sexual complaints usually arise in the context of other physical, psychological, and relationship issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess patient goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assess patient goals prior to starting treatment and use her goals to evaluate progress. This also gives the clinician the opportunity to set realistic patient expectations. While some women may desire modest improvements in their sexual life, others may expect that treatment will allow them to achieve an ideal based upon past experience or cultural images of sexuality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assess for and treat associated conditions before or during sexual dysfunction therapy. Many physical and psychological conditions are associated with sexual dysfunction. Sometimes a sexual problem can be ameliorated by diagnosing and treating an underlying problem or by adjusting therapy to minimize sexual side effects. As an example, women with depression who are experiencing sexual side effects on a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) can sometimes be treated with a different class of antidepressant. In addition, identification and treatment of substance abuse, as well as the underlying factors that precipitated it, often result in improved sexuality and overall quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Use a team approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual disorders can be complex and their treatment can be time intensive and require special expertise. With the patient's consent, communication and management decisions should be shared between the patient's clinician and other health care providers who treat the patient (eg, cardiologist, psychiatrist). Also, referrals to psychotherapists, sex therapists, or pelvic physical therapists are often needed to address specific aspects of treatment.</p><p>In addition, for women with partners, the partner must be involved in the treatment. This may include treatment of the partner's sexual dysfunction, if present, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> involvement of the partner in working with continuing relationship issues (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Sex and couples therapy'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES TO EVALUATING TREATMENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inconsistent measures to assess efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following discussion uses the best measures available for evaluation of treatment. One measure that can be quantified and compared among studies is an event log, which is the frequency of sexually satisfying events. However, an event log does not typically assess qualitative changes in sexual function, such as sexual interest or level of distress.</p><p>Most studies of sexual dysfunction treatment use validated questionnaire scores as an outcome measure. There are multiple questionnaires, which use different questions and scales. This makes it difficult to compare data between studies and treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnoses and therapies are multi-faceted</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Female sexual dysfunction typically affects more than one aspect of sexuality (eg, desire, arousal) and most therapies also impact several aspects. Thus, it is not generally possible to identify an isolated sexual issue and select a therapy that specifically targets that concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MAKING A TREATMENT PLAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As all currently available pharmacologic therapies for female sexual dysfunction are of limited efficacy and associated with side effects and potential risks, non-pharmacologic options should comprise the initial treatment for most women. The principal predictors of sexual satisfaction are physical and mental health, and the quality of the relationship with the partner, so the focus of therapy should be on interventions that optimize health, well-being and the partner relationship. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological and relationship issues often underlie, exacerbate, or are amplified by, sexual dysfunction in one or both partners. As an example, a major cause of decreased sexual desire and response is a relationship with limited communication or underlying conflict.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Sex and couples therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with sexual dysfunction will often benefit from referral to a sex <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> couples therapist. Couple's counseling is effective when there is relationship conflict or limited communication. Sex therapists often are highly trained counselors, with special expertise in human sexuality. They may be physicians, psychologists or social workers with additional training and experience. Certified sex therapists may be located through the website of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists: <a href=\"http://www.aasect.org/&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfL3JkUD5YzW89IwiGz6mFeI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.aasect.org</a>. Their services are often covered by insurers.</p><p>Sex therapists educate women and men about the normal sexual response cycle and effectively deal with cultural or religious concerns regarding sexuality. Therapists assign specific exercises, which aid many women and couples with sexual dysfunction. In one study, 65 percent of 365 couples undergoing sex therapy for a range of sexual dysfunctions described their treatment as successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Examples of sex therapy exercise include instruction in the appropriate use of vaginal dilators, which is highly effective in treating most cases of vaginismus and dyspareunia. Another approach is sensate focus exercises to help couples increase mutual sexual pleasure, minimizing the importance of orgasm as the principal goal of sexual encounters.</p><p>Sex therapists work to improve communication between couples and often help negotiate a mutually acceptable frequency of sexual activity when disparate levels of sexual interest are present and causing discord. They may direct patients to a wide range of helpful resources, including book lists, visual aids and devices.</p><p>Given the efficacy and high degree of safety of sex therapy, consultation with a sex therapist generally should be considered a prerequisite to a trial of pharmacologic therapy for most women with sexual dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic physical therapists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical therapists with subspecialty training in pelvic anatomy and function are very helpful for patients with dyspareunia, pelvic floor hypertonus (previously known as vaginismus), and pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic floor physical therapy for management of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365157540\"><span class=\"h3\">Treat incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both urinary and fecal incontinence are associated with sexual dysfunction, likely because of fear of involuntary loss of urine or stool during sexual activity. It is important to identify incontinence in women presenting with sexual concerns, as effective treatments are available, including pelvic physical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although relationship counselors and sex therapists are very helpful for psychologically healthy individuals, women with psychiatric disorders will benefit from appropriate referral. Psychiatric disorders, especially depression and anxiety, are associated with an increased likelihood of sexual dysfunction. Treatment of the underlying psychiatric problem, with appropriate pharmacology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychotherapy can lead to an improved sexual life. Prior physical, emotional or sexual abuse or substance abuse disorders also affect sexual function and may be addressed effectively in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Psychiatric and neurologic disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric illness, particularly with SSRIs, is associated with sexual dysfunction, the expertise of a psychopharmacologist may be required when sexual problems precede, or are exacerbated by psychiatric medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue, stress and lack of privacy contribute significantly to low libido and sexual problems for women. Often reducing stress with support groups, yoga or other relaxation techniques or exercise, or assistance with childcare responsibilities and housework results in improved sexual interest and satisfaction. Encouraging couples to establish a regular &quot;date night&quot; and to spend one or two nights away from family responsibilities can lead to significant improvements in sexual interest and response.</p><p>Research on sexual function consistently demonstrates increased libido and pleasure in new relationships. Although women should not be advised to improve their sex lives by seeking out new partners, they should be encouraged to bring novelty to their current relationships. Reading books about sexuality, visiting a store with items designed to increase sexual pleasure and expanding the typical sexual repertoire effectively increase libido and response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Improving body image</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman's view of her own body affects her sexual interest and satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Overweight women with sexual dysfunction should be assisted with weight loss. In addition, many women note improvements in their sex lives when they initiate a regular exercise program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Lubricants and moisturizers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lubricants during intercourse and regular use of non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers can be useful for both pre- and postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. A full discussion of vaginal lubricants can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;, section on 'Moisturizers and lubricants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Other treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clitoral suction vacuum device, EROS-Clitoral Therapy Device, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for female sexual dysfunction. Its design is similar to vacuum devices used for male erectile dysfunction. It may improve local arousal and response by improving clitoral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The device is no longer available, probably because it was very expensive and likely no more effective than less costly devices available without a prescription, such as vibrators. Clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of devices for the treatment of orgasmic disorder, with associated improvements in sexual arousal and desire. When appropriate, women should be advised to consider the use of an over-the-counter device, available at most large chain pharmacies in the section of the store where lubricants and moisturizers are sold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONE THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levels of endogenous androgens do not predict sexual function for women; however, androgen therapy that increases serum concentrations to the upper limit of normal has been shown to improve female sexual function in selected populations of postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Role of androgens'</a>.)</p><p>Discussion of androgen therapy with a patient must include a full explanation of the potential benefits and risks. Women should understand that data on safety and efficacy are limited, including data on long-term use, or use without concomitant estrogen therapy. In addition, they must be informed that none of the commonly used androgen therapies are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating female sexual dysfunction because of limited clinical trial data, limited efficacy compared with placebo, or concerns about long-term safety (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects and contraindications'</a> below). The clinician is advised to document this discussion in the medical record.</p><p>In our practice, we rarely use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a>, but will prescribe it when greatly desired by a <span class=\"nowrap\">peri/postmenopausal</span> woman with low libido associated with distress who has no contraindications to testosterone therapy and is otherwise physically and psychologically healthy and in a good sexual relationship. Typically, she has already tried other safer interventions prior to the testosterone prescription, including low-dose vaginal estrogen, relationship interventions (eg, sex therapy, date nights, use of sexual aids such as vibrators, books), and adjustment of antidepressant medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Effectiveness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal women &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Testosterone</a> therapy is the most commonly studied androgen treatment for female sexual dysfunction. The addition of testosterone to postmenopausal estrogen (with or without progestin) therapy in women who undergo menopause naturally or as a result of oophorectomy (surgical menopause) has been shown to improve sexual function in systematic reviews of randomized trials and in most, but not all, subsequent randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/6-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-16</a>]. Testosterone is primarily used to treat issues with sexual desire, although all aspects of sexual function generally improve, including arousal and orgasmic response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Formulations (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyltestosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyltestosterone</a>) and delivery methods (oral, transdermal patch, topical gel) vary across studies. The largest randomized trials utilized a transdermal testosterone patch delivering 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> testosterone in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/8,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,14</a>]. The diagnostic category HSDD was used in the study, but is no longer used and has been replaced by female sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal</span> disorder (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Women enrolled in these trials were physically and psychologically healthy with a satisfying sexual life prior to menopause and no other etiology for their HSDD, including depression or antidepressant use. Regarding dosing, in general, trials indicate that a dose of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> for six months is safe and effective in women who are receiving concomitant estrogen therapy. Benefits were reported for many aspects of sexuality, including desire, responsiveness, orgasm, and satisfaction. Pooled data from trials in surgically and naturally menopausal women found that, compared to women who received placebo, women who were treated with testosterone reported a small increase in sexually satisfying events per four weeks (an increase of 1.9 versus 0.9 events over a baseline of approximately three events) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In contrast, results of two randomized trials reported by the manufacturer of a topical testosterone gel (LibiGel) showed no significant increase in sexual desire or the number of sexually satisfying events compared with placebo, despite achieving testosterone blood levels similar to those seen in clinical trials of the testosterone patch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These data do not address use in women who are not taking postmenopausal hormone therapy. This is clinically important, since postmenopausal estrogen (with or without progestin) therapy is no longer universally recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the majority of studies have assessed the risks and benefits of androgen therapy in postmenopausal women using concurrent estrogen therapy, one large controlled trial reports similar results in menopausal women who are not taking <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> therapy. In this trial, 814 naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with HSDD were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> (daily dose of 150 or 300 mcg) or a placebo patch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The testosterone 300 mcg group reported significantly more sexual satisfying events than the placebo group (an increase of 2.1 versus 0.7 episodes per four weeks); this was not true for the 150 mcg dose (increase of 1.2 episodes). However, both testosterone doses were associated with significant improvements in desire and reduction in distress about sexual dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There were no differences in treatment efficacy between women with natural versus surgical menopause. Regarding safety, breast cancer was diagnosed in four women who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a>, as compared with none who received placebo. Although two of the cases likely were present prior to testosterone administration, the authors concluded that long-term effects of testosterone, including effects on the breast, remain uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), has been shown to improve sexual interest and satisfaction in some studies of women with adrenal insufficiency, but was ineffective in women who were perimenopausal or naturally postmenopausal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. DHEA has not been studied for treatment of sexual dysfunction in women with surgical menopause. Although systemic DHEA does not appear to be an effective treatment for sexual dysfunction in otherwise healthy women, vaginally administered DHEA (1 percent) compared with placebo improved sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm, while reducing dryness during intercourse in a randomized trial of 216 postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vaginal atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premenopausal women &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Testosterone</a> levels in women decline with age, and do not change abruptly at the time of natural menopause. Thus, women in their late 30s and 40s have low androgen levels compared with younger women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, data regarding androgen treatment of premenopausal women are few and inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. As an example, in the best designed trial, 261 women aged 35 to 46 who complained of decreased sexual satisfaction were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> (180, 90, or 45 microL) versus placebo transdermal metered spray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Improvements in satisfying sexual events compared with placebo were found only in women treated with 90 microL, but not with other testosterone doses. There were no significant improvements in any other measure of sexuality, including desire, pleasure or orgasm. Despite repeated warnings to use contraception, one woman was found to be pregnant at week 20 of the study. When considering androgen therapy in women of reproductive age, inadvertent exposure of a developing fetus must be considered a significant potential risk.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Available androgen preparations and limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No androgen therapies for female sexual dysfunction are approved by the FDA, which declined approval of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> patch for women pending additional long-term safety data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Treatment efficacy is best assessed by patient self-report of improvement of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES FOR CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Books</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Becoming Orgasmic: A Sexual and Personal Growth Program for Women, by Julia Heiman &amp; Joseph Lopiccolo</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For Women Only: A Revolutionary Guide to Overcoming Sexual Dysfunction and Reclaiming Your Sex Life, by Berman JR, Berman, LA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Getting the Sex You Want: A Woman's Guide to Becoming Proud, Passionate and Pleased in Bed, by Sandra Leiblum &amp; Judith Sachs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy, by Helen Singer Kaplan</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Making Love the Way We Used to or Better: Secrets to Satisfying Midlife Sexuality, by Alan Altman and Laurie Asher</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>My Secret Garden, by Nancy Friday</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The New Love and Sex After 60, by Robert Butler &amp; Myrna Lewis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Websites</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists: <a href=\"http://www.aasect.org/&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfL3JkUD5YzW89IwiGz6mFeI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.aasect.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/&amp;token=ppy6PCRiE9HJgc+l6sW1ndFalnIGmae8hE3RjtWYkws=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.acog.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>American Urological Association: <a href=\"http://www.auanet.org/&amp;token=caCdoiB3VdAxBqM8jbjCxAOMdJoPw35FsX6szD6RdBY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.auanet.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kinsey Institute: <a href=\"http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/&amp;token=envYgEG9WAhpH7O07uz9tJW9xyAk2eEiYCqBGm0VqQDzBYjwQ3qOfTZwqk1UMfZJ&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.kinseyinstitute.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>North American Menopause Society: <a href=\"http://www.menopause.org/&amp;token=N1Omnt8txIFovT+KPDzA4WMkssh7a3nAUdGHEbHx/iYMSTgoh9QMYyAhvRKxKuhZ&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.menopause.org</a>; module on &ldquo;Sexual Health and Menopause&rdquo; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States: <a href=\"http://www.siecus.org/&amp;token=krZ6aXAuYXZGX3UdWGr1kJgOLFl71xbKlBJcMXcp1R8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.siecus.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Society for Sex Therapy and Research: <a href=\"http://www.sstarnet.org/&amp;token=fzXftJF//6iNm/Me6m1alGzCQsJdVEIQbCfHB1IkY/CvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.sstarnet.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality: <a href=\"http://www.sexscience.org/&amp;token=X7wRz7ybJz9jcwtGA746ACdZP8cggqEbeRxycCkF0In60AzcGjMneuFZX35Bcion&amp;TOPIC_ID=5485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.sexscience.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that may alter sexual function (eg, depression, vaginal atrophy, sexual issues related to medications) should be assessed for and treated before considering other treatments for sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treat associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-pharmacologic therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle changes should be advised, including reducing stress and fatigue, increasing quality time with partners, bringing novelty to the sexual repertoire, and improving body image.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a sex therapist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychotherapist is a highly effective intervention for sexual dysfunction. Pelvic physical therapists are often needed to address specific problems, including pelvic floor hypertonus (vaginismus) or pelvic pain.

It must not be better accounted for by a general medical or psychiatric condition (ie, anxiety and depression) or due exclusively to the direct physiologic effects of a substance or medication) and for whom non-pharmacologic interventions have proven ineffective.

Postmenopausal systemic estrogen or <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> therapy is a reasonable option for women with vasomotor symptoms contributing to sexual dysfunction.

Candidates for therapy must have no contraindications to taking testosterone, be willing to accept androgenic side effects, and be counseled that this therapy is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to a lack of long-term safety data.

Use of flibanserin is associated with some mild to moderate adverse effects (eg, somnolence, dizziness) and may result in hypotension or, rarely, syncope.
