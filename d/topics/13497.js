The disorder is named after Francois Gigot de la Peyronie, surgeon to King Louis XIV, who in 1743 described &quot;rosary beads&quot; of scar tissue extending the full length of the dorsal penis in a treatise on ejaculatory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>PD can resolve spontaneously in a minority of cases while others have stable disease. However, nearly half of patients will have worsening within one year. PD can be a psychologically and physically disabling disorder, leading to a lower quality of life. Diagnosis is generally straightforward, based on history and physical examination. Ultrasound can also be used to confirm fibrotic plaque.</p><p>The efficacy of medical management for PD is limited. Treatment options typically include oral or intralesional drug therapy. In most cases, medical management should be initiated once the diagnosis of PD is made. Surgical management may be considered for patients who have penile deformity compromising sexual function and whose PD has persisted for more than 12 months, regardless of previous medical therapy.</p><p>The diagnosis and medical management of PD will be reviewed here. Surgical management of PD and general issues relating to male sexual dysfunction are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-peyronies-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of Peyronie's disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinicians, including urologists, have the misconception that Peyronie's disease (PD) is a rare condition, based on previous case reports documenting prevalence of &le;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Contemporary estimates are several-fold higher, perhaps partly due to the introduction of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors for erectile dysfunction leading to improved general awareness among patients and clinicians.</p><p>The prevalence of PD is approximately 5 percent in men. Rates range from 3 percent in a community-based survey of 8000 men (mean age 57.8) to 16 percent among 488 men undergoing evaluation for erectile dysfunction (mean age 52.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In 534 men undergoing routine prostate screening (without a specific urologic complaint), the prevalence of PD was 8.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mean age of those with PD was 68.2 years compared with 61.8 years of those without PD.</p><p>According to the same community-based survey mentioned above, the prevalence of PD among the 4432 men who responded was 1.5 percent between the ages of 30 and 39, 3 percent between 40 and 49, 3 percent between 50 and 59, 4 percent between 60 and 69, and 6.5 percent over 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The true prevalence of PD may be underestimated as men might be reluctant to report a condition to their clinician that they consider embarrassing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> older men may accept the condition as a byproduct of aging. In addition, men who do not engage in sexual intercourse, such as those with erectile dysfunction, may not be aware there is a problem, as they may not have deformities of the flaccid penis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying pathogenesis of Peyronie's disease (PD) is unknown but is likely multifactorial with an interplay between genetic predisposition, trauma, and tissue ischemia. The underlying lesion of PD is a fibrous plaque(s) that contains excessive collagen, an altered framework of reduced and fragmented elastic fibers, and fibroblastic proliferation that alters penile anatomy. The fibrous plaque causes focal inelasticity and can compromise erectile function. Plaques may be fibrous, contain areas of calcification, or are completely ossified. Most authorities postulate that PD results from repeated minor, and usually unrecognized, blunt trauma to the penis during intercourse.</p><p>PD is thought to be due to a localized aberration of the wound healing process. For susceptible individuals, bleeding within the tunica albuginea, trapping of fibrin and inflammatory cells, and overexpression of matrix proteins secondary to upregulation of cytokines and growth factors in the local environment lead to plaque formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Excess fibrin deposition in response to microvascular injury and upregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 results in one or more areas of plaque formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61965 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A family history of PD has been observed in 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Twenty-one percent of patients with PD may also have Dupuytren's contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patterns of gene expression in families with PD and Dupuytren's disease are similar, particularly in regard to collagen degradation, ossification, and myofibroblast differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Genital <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perineal injuries, radical prostatectomy, plantar fascial contractures, tympanosclerosis, urethral instrumentation, Paget disease, gout, and lipomas have been associated, albeit weakly, with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes have been proposed as risk factors, but they are more likely related to underlying erectile dysfunction, as research does not show a relation between these factors and severity of penile curvature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. An association with vascular comorbidities is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/5,6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,14</a>], as is the role of overt trauma such as penile fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although historical data suggested that the natural history of PD is often one of spontaneous resolution with conservative management, contemporary studies have shown that this is incorrect. Untreated PD resolves in only 12 percent of men, with 40 to 48 percent of men demonstrating worsening of curvature at 12 months, while curvature remains stable in the remaining men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The mean change was 15 degrees in those in whom curvature improved, while the mean change was 22 degrees in those in whom curvature worsened.</p><p>The disease state may often be divided into an acute (or inflammatory) phase and a chronic phase. During the former, there may be penile pain, even when flaccid, and there are often dynamic changes of penile malformation. During the latter, pain resolves and the malformation stabilizes in its characteristics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting symptoms of Peyronie's disease (PD) include penile pain, nodule, induration, curvature, deformity, or shortening during erection, as well as sexual dysfunction.</p><p>Penile pain occurs primarily during erection and usually resolves within 12 to 24 months of PD onset (94 percent of 246 men who did not receive medical or surgical treatment reported complete resolution of pain, mean 18 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>PD deformities are varied but may manifest as curvature, indentation, palpable plaque or nodule, hourglass narrowing, penile shortening (with or without curvature), or in combination. PD is most evident during erection, as tunical compliance is compromised and the paired corpora cavernosa are unable to expand normally. In a review of 307 men with PD, 46 percent had dorsal curvature, 29 percent lateral, and 9 percent ventral, with the remaining being a combination of curvatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Severe or complex curvature and compromised penile rigidity may make penetrative intercourse impossible. Erectile dysfunction is present in 20 to 50 percent of men with PD and occurs due to deformity preventing coitus, flail penis (cavernous fibrosis or vascular compromise), performance anxiety (psychological), or impaired erections due to venoocclusive dysfunction. Patient and partner quality of life are significantly impacted, as men with PD are at increased risk of depression, lowered self-esteem, and relationship difficulties (especially maintenance of intimacy or dating), in addition to body-image issues and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is usually apparent from patient history and penile examination. Patients can be given a preliminary diagnosis of Peyronie's disease (PD) when they present with classic symptoms of the disease: penile nodules (plaques), curvature, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain. Possible associated disorders (eg, Dupuytren's contractures or vascular disease) and inciting events (eg, trauma or genitourinary instrumentation) should be evaluated. It is important to define the psychological effect of PD on the patient and partner, as well as determine the extent of associated erectile dysfunction.</p><p>Objectively, clinicians may measure penile length, plaque size, and penile curvature. In classical PD, a well-defined plaque or induration is palpable on physical examination, even if the patient is unaware. Among men with PD affecting the dorsal side of the penis, two-thirds will have associated plaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76294 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lateral or ventral plaques are less common but, when present, can result in more coital difficulties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74188 \">figure 3</a>). Plaques located primarily in the penile septum, or equally distributed on both the ventral and dorsal aspects of the penis, may cause penile shortening without angulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Abnormal tissue may extend beyond the palpable lesion or even into the corporal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is often helpful to have the patient take photographs of the erect penis at home to characterize the deformity. Home photographs should accurately capture the penile deformity, both in terms of the angle and quality of the erection. If the patient cannot or will not produce an acceptable home photograph, office pharmacoerection can be performed.</p><p>If the diagnosis of PD is uncertain after history and physical examination, imaging may be helpful. Various imaging modalities have been used to diagnose PD, including ultrasound, plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance. Ultrasound has the highest sensitivity for plaques in the tunica albuginea compared with other methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ultrasonography has additional advantages due to its easy availability, low risk, and ability to image and quantify both calcified and soft tissue elements of PD as well as assess vascular status if a reconstructive procedure is being considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically the diagnosis of PD is clinically apparent, but infrequently it can present similarly to developmental penile deformities including congenital ventral curvature, chordee without hypospadias, or curvature associated with epispadias. A chordee is a curved erection of the penis usually due to a congenital lack of distensibility of the corpus cavernosum urethrae or discrepant size between the dorsal and ventral aspects of the tunica albuginea during development. A chordee can also be caused by gonorrheal infection, subsequent inflammation, and scar tissue formation. By contrast, PD occurs due to acquired <span class=\"nowrap\">lesions/plaques</span> of the tunica albuginea.</p><p>Although rare, other conditions such as sclerosing lymphangitis or rare neoplasms (epithelioid or angiosarcomas) have been reportedly confused with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR UROLOGY REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As Peyronie's disease (PD) is an uncommon condition and most primary care clinicians have limited experience in its management, a urology referral is recommended if the condition is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The urologist can coordinate both medical and surgical therapy for PD. Surgical management may be considered for patients who have penile deformity compromising sexual function and whose PD has persisted for more than 12 months, regardless of previous medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-erectile-dysfunction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of erectile dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for the management of Peyronie's disease (PD) include observation, medical, or surgical therapy, depending upon the severity of the disease. There are few trials examining the efficacy of the available treatment options. Most studies are hampered by low patient numbers, lack of control groups or reproducibility, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the inability to distinguish efficacy from spontaneous improvement of the disease process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Critical appraisal of contemporary literature identifies widespread use of inappropriate clinical endpoints, especially improvement in penile pain, as pain resolves spontaneously in the vast majority of patients. Improvement or resolution of penile deformity (curvature measured after an erection elicited by intracavernous injection) remains the gold standard by which therapies should be measured, while rigorous measurement of plaque size as a secondary endpoint may also be useful. It is important to note, however, that a reduction in plaque size has not been shown to correlate with reduction in curvature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p>Critical analysis of nonsurgical approaches indicates that there is no mode of treatment able to relieve all symptoms for men with PD. Nonetheless, early medical intervention while the disease is still evolving is more likely to have therapeutic effect compared with intervention when the disease is stable or even calcified. Thus, the need for early diagnosis and consideration of treatment of PD is important.</p><p>We suggest initiating medical management in PD patients without a penile deformity causing sexual dysfunction and whose PD has persisted for less than 12 months, regardless of previous medical therapy. We suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> as first-line oral therapy with moderate to severe curvature (&gt;30 degrees). In one report, pentoxifylline was found to decrease the size of plaque calcification if taken for several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In patients who do not have a good response (ie, decrease in penile deformity), intralesional injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collagenase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">collagenase</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-alfa-2b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon alfa-2b</a> may also be of benefit and can be used in conjunction with pentoxifylline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Watchful waiting is an appropriate option for select patients with PD. We suggest observation for men with stable, mild curvature (&le;30 degrees) who have satisfactory erectile function, although large observational studies and randomized trials are lacking in this patient population. Such patients who undergo observation should be told that PD may progress with worsening curvature or formation of new penile plaques in the future. If mild curvature worsens or causes sexual dysfunction, medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical management should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Indications for urology referral'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral therapy is indicated in men with moderate to severe curvature (30 degrees or more). We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> as first-line oral therapy, to be used as a part of a multimodal therapy that also includes intralesional injection and traction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pentoxifylline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact mechanism of action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> is not known. Pentoxifylline blocks transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-1-mediated inflammation, prevents deposition of collagen type I, and acts as a nonspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. In a rat model, both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> and pentoxifylline reduced the plaque size in tunical fibrosis induced by injection of TGF beta-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This agent has been previously used in humans for a variety of inflammatory and fibrotic conditions.</p><p>There are very few studies evaluating the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> in the treatment of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Encouraged by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>'s observed suppression of collagen production in Peyronie's cells in tissue culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], as well as its efficacy in other human fibrotic disorders, we have been offering patients treatment with pentoxifylline (400 mg three times daily) as a treatment option for PD since 2002. The earliest meaningful improvement in degree of curvature may take four months or more. The patient may be reassessed in four- to five-month intervals. If interval improvement is observed, pentoxifylline may be continued up to two years.</p><p>An article comparing (nonrandomized or blinded) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> demonstrated significant <span class=\"nowrap\">improvement/stability</span> in ultrasonographic calcifications (92 versus 44 percent) and decreased subjective worsening of the curvature (25 versus 78 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitamin E</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin E</a> is a potent antioxidant that is thought to reduce collagen deposition within the injured tunica albuginea.

There were no adverse events. Further studies have demonstrated that traction in conjunction with oral agents and injection therapy may improve curvature and stretched penile length to a modest degree, although the data have been mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peyronies-disease-diagnosis-and-medical-management/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].
