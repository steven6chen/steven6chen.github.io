Triple-negative breast cancer tends to behave more aggressively than other types of breast cancer. Unlike other breast cancer subtypes (ie, ER-positive, HER2-positive subtypes), there are no approved targeted treatments available, other than the administration of chemotherapy. For purposes of this review, we will consider &quot;triple-negative&quot; to mean cancers that have &le;1 percent expression of ER and PR as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and that are either 0-1+ by IHC, or 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-negative (not amplified), according to American Society of Clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">Oncology/College</span> of American Pathologists <span class=\"nowrap\">(ASCO/CAP)</span> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-the-clinical-approach-to-er-pr-negative-her2-negative-triple-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

While there are different approaches to target the immune system, the general principle involves &quot;unleashing the immune system&quot; to attack cancer cells (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>). Triple-negative breast cancer, as compared with other breast cancer subtypes, has been shown to be more immunogenic, thus expected to respond more robustly to immune checkpoint strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-the-clinical-approach-to-er-pr-negative-her2-negative-triple-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Interestingly, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) has been shown to correlate with both improved prognosis and response to standard chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-the-clinical-approach-to-er-pr-negative-her2-negative-triple-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Early clinical experience with immunotherapy in the setting of triple-negative breast cancer includes phase 1 studies of the programmed cell death (PD-1) antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a> as well as the programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atezolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atezolizumab</a>. Initial single-agent responses in PD-L1-positive, triple-negative breast cancer are approximately 20 percent for both PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-the-clinical-approach-to-er-pr-negative-her2-negative-triple-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. Additional strategies, including combination immunotherapy with chemotherapy and preoperative immunotherapy approaches, are in development. Finally, optimization of biomarkers predictive of response to immunotherapy are actively under investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98882467\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks expression of the three most commonly evaluated biomarkers (the estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] protein). (See <a href=\"#H98882311\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triple-negative breast cancer is more commonly diagnosed in younger and premenopausal African American women. (See <a href=\"#H267308777\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the triple-negative clinical phenotype is heterogeneous, the basal-like molecular subtype comprises a large proportion, particularly for <em>BRCA1</em>-associated breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer shares a number of characteristics with breast cancer gene (BRCA)-associated breast cancer, although the therapeutic ramifications of this association are unclear. (See <a href=\"#H98882326\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principles that apply to the surgical treatment and use of radiation therapy in breast cancer, and the systemic treatment approach in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, are similar in triple-negative breast cancer and other HER2-negative subtypes. (See <a href=\"#H98882362\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approach to triple-negative breast cancer'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite a higher risk of relapse compared with other breast cancer subtypes, there are no specific posttreatment surveillance guidelines for patients with triple-negative breast cancer; American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) surveillance guidelines apply similarly across subtypes. (See <a href=\"#H97089916\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy remains the backbone for systemic therapy to treat triple-negative breast cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While the platinum agents appear to have robust activity in <em>BRCA1</em> mutation carriers, there is no compelling evidence that adjuvant therapy for BRCA-associated tumors should differ from other breast cancer subsets. However, there are data in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings illustrating improvement in response rates for platinums in the setting of BRCA-associated TNBC. (See <a href=\"#H14159257\" class=\"local\">'BRCA-associated breast cancer'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with metastatic <em>BRCA1</em>-associated breast cancer who have received prior anthracycline and taxane treatment either in the adjuvant or metastatic setting, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olaparib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olaparib</a> over chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H3619540066\" class=\"local\">'PARP inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles#H267748588\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;, section on 'Special considerations for BRCA carriers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the exception of BRCA mutation carriers, in whom response rates and progression-free survival is superior with first-line platinum versus taxane treatment, there is no evidence to support a preference for any one chemotherapy agent or combination for initial therapy of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1136598543\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-the-clinical-approach-to-er-pr-negative-her2-negative-triple-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hammond ME, Hayes DF, Dowsett M, et al.
