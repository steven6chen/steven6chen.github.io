UAE treatment of fibroids is performed worldwide. Fibroids are a common gynecologic problem and result in symptoms that impact quality of life and may result in anemia or other adverse effects. There are many options for treatment, including hormonal therapy, hysteroscopic or abdominal myomectomy, and hysterectomy. UAE provides a minimally invasive and uterine-sparing treatment option.</p><p>This topic reviews UAE for uterine fibroids. The diagnosis and general principles of management of fibroids are discussed in detail separately.

The uterine arteries originate from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries in the retroperitoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83008 \">figure 2</a>). They may share a common origin with the obliterated umbilical artery, internal pudendal, or vaginal artery. The ovarian arteries arise from the abdominal aorta. The right ovarian vein returns to the inferior vena cava while the left ovarian vein returns to the left renal vein.

The embolization versus hysterectomy randomized trial (EMMY) showed no significant improvement compared with baseline in bulk-related complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-treatment-with-uterine-artery-embolization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A literature review included 511 women with adenomyosis treated with UAE and reported significant improvement in symptoms in 76 percent of patients. However, these were low-quality data from series with no control group. In addition, adenomyosis is often present in combination with uterine fibroids, and therefore the improvement might be caused by the embolized fibroids.

When UAE was introduced as a treatment for fibroids, a desire for future pregnancy was considered an absolute contraindication because there was concern that poor uterine perfusion following UAE would negatively impact fertility and result in obstetric complications or adverse fetal effects. There are some reassuring data from women who have undergone UAE and then become pregnant. However, high-quality comparative data are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H3856746749\" class=\"local\">'Reproductive outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We recommend <strong>not</strong> performing UAE in women who desire future pregnancy.

A recurrence of severe pain after a period of milder pain may indicate fibroid expulsion and warrants evaluation. UAE results in more readmissions than hysterectomy or myomectomy.

Ultrasound can show a prolapsing fibroid or evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease. Magnetic resonance imaging is used in rare cases where ultrasound findings are inconclusive. Blood cultures should be ordered if systemic infection is suspected, but we have rarely seen a patient with positive blood cultures after UAE.</p><p>If examination or laboratory testing is consistent with infection, we treat with antibiotics. Endometrial infection occurs in 0.5 percent of cases (mostly with submucosal fibroids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-treatment-with-uterine-artery-embolization/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The procedure is a percutaneous angiographic procedure performed with video fluoroscopic imaging with injection of embolic agents into the uterine artery. (See <a href=\"#H81961742\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideal candidates for UAE include women with heavy menstrual bleeding or dysmenorrhea caused by intramural fibroids, who are premenopausal, and who have no desire for future pregnancy. If pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/pressure</span> or bulk-related symptoms are the only symptom, efficacy of UAE is questionable. (See <a href=\"#H81961748\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <strong>not</strong> performing UAE in women who desire future pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Exceptions to this may include women who have severe anemia or symptoms associated with fibroids, have failed conservative measure and have contraindications to surgery or those who consent to UAE within an approved research protocol; appropriate counseling about potential risks to the patient and a fetus should be given. (See <a href=\"#H128993140\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3856746749\" class=\"local\">'Reproductive outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subserosal or submucosal fibroids that are pedunculated and have a narrow stalk (stalk &lt;50 percent in diameter in comparison with the largest diameter fibroid) are considered a relative contraindication to UAE. (See <a href=\"#H128993140\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume of necrosis after UAE in a large fibroid uterus can be substantial with a proportionate level of postprocedural pain. However, no clear threshold for the size of the uterus or size or number of fibroids has been established as a contraindication. (See <a href=\"#H128993140\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first-line imaging study to evaluate for uterine fibroids is pelvic ultrasound. Many protocols include magnetic resonance imaging before UAE in order to properly determine size and location and ensure that the uterine masses are consistent with uterine fibroids. (See <a href=\"#H3603201212\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients (73 to 90 percent) reported improvement or disappearance of heavy menstrual bleeding symptoms up to ten years after treatment. Lower abdominal pain or dysmenorrhea shows an improvement in up to 80 percent of patients. Approximately 28 percent of women undergo hysterectomy within five years after UAE. (See <a href=\"#H1658807037\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3596343553\" class=\"local\">'Need for subsequent treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common complications of UAE include pelvic pain, fever, and vaginal discharge, but these are self-limited in most patients. Some women may develop ovarian insufficiency. The most serious potential complications are introduction of embolic agents into inadvertent vessels, necrosis of the gluteus maximus or limb, or pulmonary embolism.
