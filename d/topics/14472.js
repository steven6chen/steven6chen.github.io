Severe prolonged neutropenia is most likely to occur in the preengraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT; particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. One approach to reducing infectious complications involves the use of prophylactic antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents in patients at significant risk of such infections.</p><p>Because neutropenic patients are unable to mount robust inflammatory responses, serious infection can occur with minimal symptoms and signs. In such patients, fever is often the only sign of infection. Infections in neutropenic patients can progress rapidly, leading to hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other life-threatening complications. Thus, empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated promptly in all febrile neutropenic patients (including those receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis) to reduce the risk of serious morbidity and mortality.

At institutions that use fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, systematic monitoring of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance among gram-negative bacilli should be performed.</p><p>Based upon the available data, we suggest fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for high-risk neutropenic patients (patients anticipated to have an absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for &gt;7 days) who do not have a contraindication to receiving a fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67027 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H1115683725\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>When considering the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, caution is indicated in patients at risk of a prolonged QT interval because QT prolongation is a known toxicity. This is particularly important to consider in patients who may require other QT prolonging agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>).

There has also been concern about the possibility of increasing the risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infections, although this has not been proven among neutropenic patients receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In institutions and geographic regions in which there are appreciable rates of fluoroquinolone resistance, the use of these agents for prophylaxis is less likely to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Practices regarding the use of antibacterial prophylaxis vary from center to center, with some centers avoiding the routine use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.</p><p>For most patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia expected to be of short duration (which includes standard chemotherapy regimens for most solid tumors), we recommend against the use of antibacterial prophylaxis. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes-in-adult-cancer-patients-at-low-risk-for-complications#H247552642\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of neutropenic fever syndromes in adult cancer patients at low risk for complications&quot;, section on 'Antibacterial prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2722434\"><span class=\"h4\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing for initiating and discontinuing antibacterial prophylaxis has not been adequately studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When indicated, many clinicians start antibacterial prophylaxis either on the first day of cytotoxic chemotherapy or on the day after the administration of the last dose of the cycle of chemotherapy. It is common to discontinue antibacterial prophylaxis when the neutropenia has resolved or, for patients who become febrile during neutropenia, when an empiric antibacterial regimen is initiated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1115683725\"><span class=\"h3\">Guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend consideration of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in patients at high risk for profound prolonged neutropenia (anticipated absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for &gt;7 days). International guidelines for the prevention of infections in HCT recipients recommend fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in patients anticipated to be neutropenic for seven days or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As noted above, our approach differs slightly from the IDSA's approach because we consider high-risk patients to be those who are anticipated to have an ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (rather than &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> for &gt;7 days.

(See <a href=\"#H2466539260\" class=\"local\">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p>Combination of a fluoroquinolone plus an antibiotic with enhanced activity against gram-positive organisms is <strong>not</strong> recommended for prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While studies have shown that this approach may reduce infections due to <em>Staphylococcus</em> and <em>Streptococcus </em>spp and reduce the incidence of neutropenic fever, they do not affect infection-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, increased rates of breakthrough-resistant gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections have limited the utility of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults/abstract/4,5,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10,11</a>].
