This was the result of an international consensus process with the goal of avoiding poorly defined or confusing terms used previously (eg, menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, oligomenorrhea). The classification system is referred to by the acronym PALM-COEIN (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia, coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic, and not yet classified) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90483 \">figure 1</a>).

This guides the further evaluation, differential diagnosis, and disposition of the patient (ie, whether immediate evaluation and intervention are needed). The algorithm includes the basic components of the evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90594\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90594 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8513741\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the uterus the source of the bleeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) typically present with a complaint of vaginal bleeding. There are many potential sources of genital tract bleeding, and the actual site must be determined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527 \">table 1</a>). Sites that are commonly mistaken for uterine bleeding include the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, or cervix), urinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract. The following elements of the history and physical examination help to exclude extrauterine sources of bleeding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the vulva, vagina, or cervix </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most genital tract bleeding is from the uterus or the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, cervix). Extrauterine upper genital tract bleeding is less common. The most common etiology of such bleeding is ectopic pregnancy, which can be excluded with negative pregnancy testing (see <a href=\"#H16087745\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy test'</a> below). Uncommon extrauterine etiologies of upper tract bleeding are ovarian or fallopian tubal cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The volume of bleeding gives some suggestion of the source for genital tract bleeding. Heavy bleeding typically derives from the uterus, while staining, spotting, or light bleeding may be from any genital tract site. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The color of the blood provides a limited amount of information regarding the source. Brown staining may represent old blood as a result of light bleeding or spotting from the upper vagina, cervix, or uterus. Red blood may derive from any genital tract site. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the bleeding is consistently postcoital, this suggests cervical pathology, including cervical neoplasia. However, postcoital bleeding may occur with contact during intercourse of any site along the lower genital tract that is friable (eg, due to cervicitis or vulvovaginal atrophy) or has a lesion (eg, cervical polyp or vulvar ulcer). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postcoital-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postcoital bleeding in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pelvic examination should include evaluation of all lower genital tract sites to assess for areas of friability or lesions. In addition, a finding on bimanual examination of pelvic tenderness or a pelvic mass warrants further evaluation for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or uterine or adnexal pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary or gastrointestinal tract bleeding </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The following medical history questions help to determine whether the bleeding is from a nongenital source: (1) Is the patient certain that the bleeding is from the vagina? (2) Does the patient see the blood in the toilet only during or after either urination or defecation? (3) Does the patient see the bleeding only when she wipes with toilet tissue? If so, has tried to separately dab the urethra, vagina, and anus with toilet tissue to check the source of the bleeding? (4) If she uses a pad, on what part of the pad does she see blood? (5) Does she still see the bleeding while she has a tampon in the vagina? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physical examination helps to identify some, but not all, urinary or gastrointestinal tract bleeding sources. Inspection of the urethra may reveal a urethral caruncle (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-caruncle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral caruncle&quot;</a>). A finding on anorectal examination of a lesion (eg, hemorrhoid or rectal mass) or positive fecal occult blood testing provides evidence of a nongenital source. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In general, if the bleeding occurs solely with urination or defecation and the pattern of bleeding or findings on physical examination are consistent with a urinary or gastrointestinal tract source, this should be the focus of further evaluation. If these etiologies are excluded, evaluation of the genital tract should continue. Evaluation of hematuria and rectal bleeding is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-minimal-bright-red-blood-per-rectum-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to minimal bright red blood per rectum in adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the patient premenarchal or postmenopausal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of AUB for reproductive-age women differs from that of premenarchal or postmenopausal patients. Thus, it is important to establish the reproductive status of the patient.</p><p>The average age of menarche is 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For premenarchal girls, there is a range of causes of vaginal bleeding, for example, hormonal issues, infection, foreign body, trauma, or malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-children-and-adolescents#H11716915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of vaginal bleeding in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Vaginal bleeding before normal menarche'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The average age of menopause is 51 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. This is typically preceded by several years of irregular uterine bleeding and menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flushes). In healthy women age 45 years and older, laboratory testing of serum follicle stimulating hormone is not required to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with AUB who have not had amenorrhea for 12 months should be considered premenopausal for the purpose of evaluation, but should have endometrial sampling if risk factors for endometrial cancer are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 4</a>). All postmenopausal bleeding is abnormal, and requires evaluation for endometrial cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H16090927\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the patient pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with AUB should have pregnancy testing. The history of the last several menstrual periods should be elicited to get some sense of ovulatory status. However, pregnancy testing should be performed even in women with recent vaginal bleeding, since this may represent bleeding during pregnancy rather than menses. It should also be performed in women who report no sexual activity and in those who report use of contraception.</p><p>Women who are pregnant are evaluated primarily for pregnancy-related causes of bleeding, but the evaluation should include assessment for etiologies not related to pregnancy if appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16087721\"><span class=\"h1\">FURTHER EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nonpregnant reproductive-age women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), the goals of the evaluation are to determine the pattern, severity, and etiology of the bleeding, and thereby to guide management. Key questions that help to guide the clinician include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the bleeding pattern?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should a complete blood count be performed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should endometrial sampling be performed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should a coagulation evaluation be performed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is bleeding related to a contraceptive method?</p><p/><p>As the evaluation proceeds, the possibility of concurrent factors should be considered. As an example, a woman with a fibroid uterus may also have a defect of hemostasis that is the primary reason for her heavy bleeding or she may be bleeding from an endometrial or endocervical malignancy unrelated to the fibroid uterus. Therefore, several potential etiologies often need to be investigated and, if a cause of AUB is determined but bleeding persists despite treatment, the patient should be evaluated for additional etiologies.</p><p>The basic components of the evaluation are shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90594\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90594 \">algorithm 1</a>).

A prior myomectomy raises the possibility that uterine fibroids are responsible for AUB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Contraceptive history &ndash; Women using estrogen-progestin contraceptives may develop unscheduled bleeding, while use of progestin-only contraceptives often results in irregular uterine bleeding or amenorrhea.

Endometrial sampling is indicated if AUB is persistent, occurs in the setting of a history of unopposed estrogen exposure (obesity, chronic ovulatory dysfunction) or failed medical management of the bleeding, or in women at high risk of endometrial cancer (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy, Lynch or Cowden syndrome). &#160;</p><p/><p>Use of 45 years-old as the threshold for increased concern regarding endometrial neoplasia is supported by evidence that the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is fairly low prior to age 45 years and increases with advancing age; 19 percent of cases occur in women aged 45 to 54 years compared with 6 percent in those aged 35 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

For women with ovulatory dysfunction, given that six months of unopposed estrogen therapy substantially increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia in menopausal women, it is reasonable to consider six months or more of AUB-O as &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In particular, obese women with AUB are at an increased risk of endometrial neoplasia regardless of age. This is because obese women have high levels of endogenous estrogen due to the conversion of androstenedione to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> and the aromatization of androgens to estradiol in adipose tissue, and this becomes a source of endogenous unopposed estrogen in the setting of ovulatory dysfunction.

For other types of AUB in women &lt;45 years, the clinician must use their judgement regarding when abnormal bleeding is persistent.

In premenopausal women, measurement of endometrial thickness is not a useful test, since major variation of the thickness occurs during the normal menstrual cycle. In this patient population, transvaginal ultrasound does provide useful information regarding structural causes of AUB and can identify a heterogenous endometrium due to hyperplasia or cancer.

AUB can be caused by a wide variety of local and systemic diseases or related to medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common etiologies are conditions associated with pregnancy, structural uterine pathology (eg, fibroids, endometrial polyps, adenomyosis), ovulatory dysfunction, bleeding disorders, or neoplasia. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21539499\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial approach to evaluation of nonpregnant reproductive-age women with AUB is to confirm that the source of bleeding is the uterus, exclude pregnancy, and confirm that the patient is premenopausal. In addition, women with acute bleeding should be evaluated in an urgent care facility. (See <a href=\"#H22457447\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of further evaluation are to determine the pattern, severity, and etiology of the bleeding to guide management. A primary focus is to identify women who require evaluation for endometrial carcinoma or other uterine malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H16087721\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AUB varies from normal menses in terms of frequency, regularity, volume, or duration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103238\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103238 \">table 7</a>). Typical abnormal bleeding patterns include: regular menses that are heavy or prolonged, intermenstrual bleeding, irregular bleeding (typically associated with ovulatory dysfunction), and amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H196131\" class=\"local\">'Menstrual history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial sampling should be performed in nonpregnant women with AUB and an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Indications for endometrial sampling vary by age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16090927\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding disorders, particularly von Willebrand disease (VWD), are common in reproductive-age women. A disorder should be suspected if heavy or prolonged menses began at menarche or is associated with a family history of coagulopathy or other signs of a bleeding diathesis (eg, easy bruising or prolonged bleeding from mucosal surfaces). In addition, anticoagulants may cause heavy or prolonged uterine bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H10390722\" class=\"local\">'Coagulation tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device (IUD) may cause AUB. (See <a href=\"#H10405618\" class=\"local\">'General history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All women with AUB should have a complete history and physical examination. Information should be obtained on the frequency, duration, and volume of AUB, as well as the presence of associated symptoms and precipitating factors. (See <a href=\"#H16087727\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16087733\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most reproductive-age women with AUB should be evaluated initially with the following tests: human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), complete blood count, hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematocrit. Additional tests may be performed to assess for particular etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H21539436\" class=\"local\">'Initial tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16087763\" class=\"local\">'Additional tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic imaging is useful if a structural lesion (endometrial polyps, leiomyomas, adenomyosis, or an adnexal mass) or vascular lesion (enhanced myometrial vascularity) is suspected based upon the history and physical examination; it is not required in every woman with AUB. Pelvic ultrasound is the first-line study and is often used alone, or may be combined with either saline infusion sonography or hysteroscopy to provide information about lesions that protrude into the endometrial cavity (submucosal leiomyomas, myometrial leiomyomas that protrude into the cavity, and endometrial polyps). (See <a href=\"#H16087769\" class=\"local\">'Imaging and hysteroscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14753132\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author and UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dr. Annekathryn Goodman, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Spencer CP, Whitehead MI.
