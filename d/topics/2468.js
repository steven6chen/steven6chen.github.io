Multiple therapeutic regimens have been designed to prevent or treat bone loss in postmenopausal women and older adults. The first step in the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis is ensuring adequate nutrition, particularly maintaining an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. Vitamin D enhances intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Low concentrations of vitamin D are associated with impaired calcium absorption, a negative calcium balance, and a compensatory rise in parathyroid hormone (PTH), which results in excessive bone resorption.</p><p>Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of osteoporosis will be reviewed here. Detailed information regarding pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis and the role of calcium in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13468588\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIMAL INTAKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal intake of calcium and vitamin D is uncertain. Based upon the meta-analyses discussed below, we suggest 1200 mg of calcium (total of diet and supplement) and 800 international units of vitamin D daily for most postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Although the optimal intake (diet plus supplement) has not been clearly established in premenopausal women or in men with osteoporosis, 1000 mg of calcium (total of diet and supplement) and 600 international units of vitamin D daily are generally suggested. We recommend <strong>not</strong> administering yearly high-dose (eg, 500,000 international units) vitamin D.</p><p>These recommendations are consistent with the Institute of Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The American Geriatrics Society and the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommend a slightly higher dose of vitamin D supplementation (at least 1000 and 800 to 1000 international units daily, respectively), as well as calcium supplements, to older adults (&ge;65 years) to reduce the risk of fractures and falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1349722\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D supplementation'</a>.)</p><p>Certain coexisting medical problems may alter these requirements. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting medical problems'</a> below.)</p><p>Optimal intake can be achieved with a combination of diet plus supplements, although we prefer that as much as possible (at least half) of the calcium come from dietary sources. Calcium appears to be as well absorbed from supplements as from milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and supplements were used in the above trials demonstrating benefit from increased calcium intake. It is likely, therefore, that supplements are not less effective than calcium found naturally in dairy products. However, supplements may have more adverse effects, particularly kidney stones. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>It is important for patients to be aware that in the majority of patients, calcium and vitamin D alone are insufficient to prevent fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], although they may be beneficial in some subgroups (older adults, those with low intake at baseline). Normal concentrations of vitamin D are essential for a number of other reasons independent of bone health; these are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D and extraskeletal health&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIETARY SOURCES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During clinic visits, we estimate dietary calcium intake with the aim of recommending increased dietary calcium (or calcium supplements) to patients with inadequate dietary intake and preventing excessive calcium supplementation in patients with adequate dietary intake. A rough method of estimating dietary calcium intake is to multiply the number of dairy servings consumed per day by 300 mg. One serving is 8 oz (240 mL) of milk or yogurt or 1 oz (29 g) of hard cheese. Cottage cheese and ice cream contain approximately 150 mg of calcium per 4 oz (113 g). Other foods in a well-balanced diet (dark green vegetables, some nuts, breads, and cereals) supply an average of 100 to 200 mg of calcium daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a>). Some cereals, soy products, and fruit juices are fortified with up to 1000 mg of calcium.</p><p>While it is possible to estimate the amount of calcium in other sources of dietary calcium, such as green vegetables and nuts, calcium absorption from these sources is more variable. In addition, vegetables and nuts have much lower calcium content than dairy products so that much more would need to be consumed to meet daily requirements. Detailed lists of the calcium content of various foods are available from the US Department of Agriculture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Increased intake of dairy products or calcium-rich foods should be encouraged if dietary calcium intake is below recommended levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"#H13468588\" class=\"local\">'Optimal intake'</a> above). If this is not possible and supplements are needed, it is important to note that the intake suggested above reflects the amount of elemental calcium in supplements, not the total calcium content (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Calcium'</a> below). In addition, the total intake of calcium (diet plus supplements) should not routinely exceed 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> because of the possibility of adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, commercially fortified milk is the largest source of dietary vitamin D, containing approximately 100 international units of vitamin D per 8 oz (240 mL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77982 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, vitamin D intake can be estimated by multiplying the number of cups of milk consumed per day by 100. Vitamin D is also found in cod liver oil, but some fish oils also contain high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>, and therefore, they are not the best source of vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Sunlight exposure also increases vitamin D concentrations. However, the use of sunscreen products effectively blocks vitamin D synthesis. In addition, the skin of those older than 70 years of age does not convert vitamin D as efficiently as in younger individuals (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>). Thus, vitamin D supplements are necessary for older adults and for people who avoid sunlight. The safe upper limit for vitamin D dosing is unclear. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine defined the Safe Upper Limit for vitamin D as 4000 international units per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPLEMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients requiring calcium and vitamin D supplementation, a daily multivitamin is both convenient and economical. However, most multivitamins contain only 400 international units of vitamin D, which is insufficient, and not all individuals require or tolerate multivitamins (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;</a>). Individuals with osteoporosis can also increase vitamin D and calcium intake by taking plain vitamin D supplements <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium supplements that also contain vitamin D, usually 200 to 500 international units per 500 or 600 mg of calcium. It is important to note that there is not a direct linear relationship between supplemental dosing and level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). Individuals with low levels at baseline (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> generally have an increase in 25(OH)D of 1.0 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for every 100 international units of vitamin D; however, individuals at levels above 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> show an attenuated increase in serum 25(OH)D (ie, usually 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for every 100 international units). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Dosing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely available calcium supplements are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78814 \">table 3</a>). Calcium carbonate is cheapest and therefore often a good first choice. However, there are some limitations to its use compared with calcium citrate:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcium carbonate</a> absorption is better when taken with meals; in comparison, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> is well absorbed in the fasting state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>] and is equally absorbed compared with calcium carbonate taken with a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This may be particularly important in patients with achlorhydria. Thus, it seems prudent to take calcium carbonate with meals since it is often hard to know who has achlorhydria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcium carbonate</a> is also poorly absorbed in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers. We usually recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> as a first-line calcium supplement in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;, section on 'Proton pump inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many natural <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> preparations such as oyster shells or bone meal contain some lead, and small amounts are present in refined (antacid) calcium carbonate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The low lead levels in calcium supplements are unlikely to be a health risk, because calcium blocks lead absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>The intake recommendations given above refer to the amount of <strong>elemental calcium</strong> (see <a href=\"#H13468588\" class=\"local\">'Optimal intake'</a> above). As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> is 40 percent elemental calcium, so that 1250 mg of calcium carbonate contains 500 mg of elemental calcium. The dose of elemental calcium is listed on some supplement labels but not others. If the labeling reports the amount per &quot;serving&quot; instead of the amount per tablet, it is important to verify that the patient is taking the correct number of tablets per serving.</p><p>Calcium supplementation in excess of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> should be given in divided doses. Higher individual doses are associated with a plateau in calcium absorption that may prevent the attainment of positive calcium balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total intake of calcium (diet plus supplements) should not routinely exceed 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> because of the possibility of adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22148109\"><span class=\"h4\">Nephrolithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, concern that high <strong>dietary</strong> calcium increases the risk of nephrolithiasis in otherwise healthy patients is unfounded as the incidence of stone formation appears to be reduced in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In randomized, clinical trials, however, calcium <strong>supplements</strong> have been associated with an increased risk of kidney stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial reported an increased risk of kidney stones in postmenopausal women who were supplemented with calcium and vitamin D when compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, neither calcium supplements (up to 1000 mg daily), increased dietary intake of calcium, nor vitamin D supplements have been shown to increase all-cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] or cardiovascular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] mortality, and in one meta-analysis of trials comparing vitamin D with or without calcium with no treatment or placebo, calcium plus vitamin D was associated with reduced all-cause mortality in older adults (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. We and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] suggest combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as reviewed above. The National Osteoporosis Foundation considers supplementation in this dose range safe from a cardiovascular viewpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13468588\" class=\"local\">'Optimal intake'</a> above.)</p><p>In the WHI trial, there was no effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this trial, 36,282 postmenopausal women ages 50 to 69 years were randomly assigned to calcium (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> plus vitamin D (400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day)</span> or placebo (personal supplementation of up to 1000 mg additional calcium and 600 international units vitamin D was also allowed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. CVD was a prespecified secondary outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At baseline, mean calcium intake (diet plus supplements) was approximately 1150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and 54 percent of participants were taking nonprotocol calcium supplements. After seven years, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on the incidence of MI (confirmed in 411 and 390 women assigned to <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/vitamin</span> D and placebo, respectively; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91-1.20) or stroke (362 versus 377 strokes; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.10).</p><p>However, the findings of two meta-analyses evaluating calcium or calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation (eight and nine trials, respectively) raised some concern about an increased risk of MI in patients randomly assigned to calcium versus placebo (166 versus 130 MIs; pooled relative risk [RR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.59) or calcium with or without vitamin D versus placebo (374 versus 302 MIs; RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The meta-analyses had several limitations. The trials in the meta-analyses were not designed to explore cardiovascular outcomes, which were not uniformly collected or adjudicated. Patient-level data were not available from all the trials. In one of the meta-analyses, only data from a subgroup of participants in the WHI (those not taking personal calcium supplements at randomization), rather than all participants, were included in the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The baseline dietary calcium intake in the trials ranged from 750 to 1240 mg daily, and the addition of calcium supplements raised total intake over 1500 to 2000 mg daily in many patients, which is higher than recommended.</p><p>In contrast, other meta-analyses have not shown an increased risk of cardiovascular events with calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/24,28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28,31</a>]. As an example, in a pooled analysis of four trials, calcium supplementation did not significantly increase the risk of CVD events compared with placebo (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.92-1.41). In these trials, dietary intake of calcium ranged from 800 to 900 mg daily, and the dose of calcium supplements ranged from 600 to 1200 mg daily. In a pooled analysis of two trials (one of which was the WHI and included data from all participants), combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation versus double placebos (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92-1.18) and vitamin D alone compared with placebo (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77-1.05) also did not significantly increase the risk of CVD, and there was a suggestion of a benefit in CVD reduction with vitamin D alone. As in the meta-analyses described above, none of the trials were designed to assess the effects of calcium or vitamin D on cardiovascular outcomes.</p><p>In some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], prospective studies, there was an increased risk of cardiovascular problems with calcium supplements. One study showed a significant increased risk of MI in users versus nonusers of calcium supplements (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and the other showed an increased risk of heart disease death among men, but not women, who used calcium supplements (&gt;1000 mg daily) versus men who did not take supplements (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.37) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. There were only 20 to 60 events in the calcium group, which reduced the precision of the analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In contrast to the findings with calcium <strong>supplements</strong>, prospective cohort studies showed either no relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>] or an inverse relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>] between <strong>dietary</strong> calcium intake and risk of heart disease death or MI. As an example, in one study (23,980 participants with mean follow-up of 11 years), there was a significant reduction in MI risk in patients with higher versus lower total dietary calcium intake (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.94 for the third compared with lowest quartile of total dietary calcium intake) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, it is unclear from the present data whether intake of dietary calcium versus calcium supplements confers different cardiovascular risks. Randomized trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with CVD events ascertained as a primary endpoint are required to determine if calcium supplementation is associated with an increased occurrence of these events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22148128\"><span class=\"h4\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other potential side effects of high calcium intake include dyspepsia and constipation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health#H651654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D and extraskeletal health&quot;, section on 'Falls'</a>.)</p><p>In the aggregate, these observations suggest that low levels of vitamin D are associated with fractures. Although the optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration to maintain skeletal health is not firmly established, serum values exceeding 12 to 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (30 to 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> are supported by observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/91-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-94</a>]. The safe upper boundary, and whether serum 25(OH)D levels above 45 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (99 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> are associated with an increased risk of fracture, falls, or other adverse effect, is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The controversy surrounding optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration is reviewed in more detail separately.

They have skeletal resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH). In the WHI, the black women had a higher rate of fracture when the vitamin D level was &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> which is the opposite of the risk in white women, in whom the fracture rate was lower when the vitamin D level was &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. There is very little evidence about effects of vitamin D or calcium supplementation in persons who are not Caucasian, but since racial differences in mineral metabolism are substantial, we cannot apply findings from one race to other races. It has been shown that black women do increase their circulating levels of vitamin D after oral supplementation to levels similar to white patients, but it is not clear if this is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>]. However, there may be differences in the vitamin D-binding protein levels by race (depending on the assay employed), which complicates interpretation of the total 25(OH)D level and their PTH response. Currently it is unclear whether &quot;free&quot; 25(OH)D levels (either calculated or directly measured) differ by race or ethnicity.

In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, 1200 mg of calcium daily (total diet plus supplement) and 800 international units of vitamin D daily are advised. Although the optimal intake (diet plus supplement) has not been clearly established in premenopausal women or in men with osteoporosis, 1000 mg of calcium (total of diet and supplement) and 600 international units of vitamin D daily are generally suggested. (See <a href=\"#H13468588\" class=\"local\">'Optimal intake'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal intake can be achieved with a combination of diet plus supplements, although we prefer that at least half come from dietary sources. Dairy products have the highest calcium content per serving (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a>). In the United States, commercially fortified milk is the largest source of dietary vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77982 \">table 2</a>).

If this is not possible, we suggest calcium and vitamin D supplementation in patients with osteoporosis and inadequate dietary intake (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Supplements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most widely available calcium supplements are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78814 \">table 3</a>). In most individuals, calcium carbonate taken with meals is adequate for supplementation and is inexpensive. However, we recommend calcium citrate in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers or who have achlorhydria (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;, section on 'Proton pump inhibitors'</a>).

The Safe Upper Limit for vitamin D is 4000 international units daily, but this is based on limited data.

Until this issue is settled, it would be wise to avoid excess supplementation, to avoid doses over 500 mg at one time, and to encourage dietary intake over tablets.
