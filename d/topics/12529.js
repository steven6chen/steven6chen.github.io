Psychotherapies within each of these categories broadly share a similar explanatory model and set of techniques. However, therapies are frequently modified (and may be renamed) when applied to new conditions or populations. The psychotherapies that follow have been tested for efficacy to varying degrees in clinical trials with specific populations and disorders. The therapies in the trials are delivered by trained therapists using structured protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive and behavioral psychotherapies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpersonal psychotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motivational interviewing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialectical behavior therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive psychotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychoeducation</p><p/><p>In some cases, psychotherapy may be more effective when administered in conjunction with medication.

CBT often includes education, relaxation exercises, coping skills training, stress management, or assertiveness training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In cognitive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the therapist helps the patient identify and correct distorted, maladaptive beliefs. Behavioral therapy uses thought exercises or real experiences to facilitate symptom reduction and improved functioning. This may occur through learning, through decreased reactivity from repeated exposure to a stimulus, or through other mechanisms.</p><p>Individuals for whom cognitive behavioral therapy works best are generally highly motivated and value a problem-solving approach, because therapy requires that the patient learns the skills of self-observation. Patients learn cognitive and behavioral skills and practice them within and outside of the therapy setting.</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is an evidence-based treatment for psychiatric disorders including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, eating disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder, as well as several medical conditions (eg, insomnia, smoking, low back pain). These applications are discussed in detail separately. We have listed only some of the representative topics given that CBT is utilized in a large number of psychiatric and medical conditions.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy is based upon the idea that childhood experiences, past unresolved conflicts, and previous relationships significantly influence an individual&rsquo;s current situation in life. Adult relationships are understood to be a byproduct of unconscious patterns that begin in childhood. Psychodynamic psychotherapy uncovers the unconscious patterns of interpersonal relationships, conflicts, and desires with the goal of improved functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Psychodynamic therapy is used for some psychiatric disorders, including depression, anorexia nervosa, and personality disorders.

Derived from cognitive-behavioral and readiness-to-change models, motivational interviewing seeks to help patients recognize and make changes to these behaviors, matching strategies to the patient&rsquo;s stage of readiness to change. Key elements of motivational interviewing include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expressing empathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helping the patient identify discrepancies between his or her problematic behaviors and broader, personal values.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accepting the patient&rsquo;s resistance to change</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhancing the patient&rsquo;s self-efficacy (ie, confidence in his or her capability to surmount obstacles and successfully change).</p><p/><p>The intensity of motivational interviewing can vary, but efficacious models are approximately 60 minutes in length, delivered over one to five sessions. The use of motivational interviewing is growing, and has been applied to the treatment of substance use disorders, promoting lifestyle changes (eg, weight reduction, smoking cessation), and encouraging adherence to complex medical treatments (eg, heart failure self-management). It is often employed as an evidence-based adjunct to other interventions when encountering low levels of patient motivation to change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

DBT includes skills training, mindful practice, and close monitoring of and intervention in crises that may develop. Sessions are typically more than once a week and supplemented with contacts between sessions as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2983420505\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive psychotherapy or counseling is widely used in medical practice, eg, to help individuals cope with illness, deal with a crisis or transient problem, and maintain optimism or hope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Techniques vary but most models emphasize communication of interest and empathy; supportive therapy may also include guidance on available services, advice, respect, praise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> encouragement. The efficacy and administration of supportive psychotherapy for depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-supportive-psychotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Supportive psychotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1154004\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER PSYCHOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other psychotherapies may have shown less consistently positive results in clinical trials or may not have been rigorously tested. Widely used psychotherapies may vary as delivered by one therapist to the next. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432862194\"><span class=\"h2\">Eclectic or integrative psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In surveys of mental health clinicians in the United States and Canada, a majority of clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and others) identified themselves as practicing an eclectic or integrative form of psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Eclectic and integrative therapists draw concepts and techniques from a variety of different types of therapy, including psychodynamic, cognitive, and behavioral approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some are largely constructed from elements from evidence based therapies whereas others are not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158682494\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMAT OF PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the orientation of therapy, treatment is offered in different formats. Therapy may be presented to the individual, a couple, a family unit, or in a group of individuals or peers who are not related.</p><p>There is generally no single preferred format, although there is evidence that some problems respond better or worse to different configurations. As an example, the preponderance of clinical experience and study data indicate that couple therapy is useful for marital problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Group therapy for adolescents with problem behavior may result in increased delinquency, whereas group therapy may be helpful for adults with a substance use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158682519\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individual therapy is the most commonly practiced format of psychotherapy. Individual therapy allows for a confidential interaction between patient and provider, permitting maximal disclosure without fear of others listening or interrupting. The majority of the evidence for practicing psychotherapy involves individual therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158682526\"><span class=\"h2\">Couple therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Couple therapy or marital therapy allows two partners to overcome relationship difficulties with the help of a therapist. Specific issues that may be addressed with couple therapy include sexual relations and parenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. It is a valuable adjunctive treatment in some disorders such as depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], particularly when there is comorbid relationship distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158682533\"><span class=\"h2\">Family therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family therapies, in which family members are seen together in treatment, focus on the family system and its ability to help both family problems and individual psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Family therapy attempts to correct distorted communications and impaired relationships as a means of helping the entire family, including the patient with the psychiatric disorder. Family therapy is complex in that it represents not only a format for therapy but a systemic orientation toward treatment in which family is viewed as a potential agent of change. For patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, family psychoeducation helps family members learn about the disorder, solve problems, and cope more constructively with the patient's illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Using family therapy to treat depressed patients is discussed separately.

Cognitive, psychodynamic, supportive, and psychoeducational techniques may be used. Group therapy is often used for bereavement, in patients with a substance use disorder, or in patients experiencing a chronic or life-threatening condition such as diabetes or cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432862411\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should consider initiating or referring a patient for psychotherapy for the following purposes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of a psychiatric disorder, with the goal of reducing or ameliorating symptoms and improving functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing maladaptive thoughts, behaviors, or relationships.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing support when a crisis, a difficult period, or a chronic problem impairs functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhancing a patient&rsquo;s capacity to make behavioral changes, eg, losing weight, quitting smoking, or increasing adherence to medical treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helping ameliorate a relational problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing family cooperation with treatment.</p><p/><p>Patient improvement in psychotherapy varies by presenting disorder or problem, its severity and complexity, and the particular treatment provided in each case. The likelihood of improvement is discussed separately for individual disorders. The patient and therapist should set realistic goals for treatment and periodically evaluate whether these goals are being met. If improvement does not occur within the planned duration of treatment, the intervention should be reassessed and other clinical options should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71600832\"><span class=\"h1\">STAFF AND SETTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychotherapy may be provided by many types of clinicians, including psychiatrists and other physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and family therapists. Clinicians typically require specialized training to provide structured, evidence-based psychotherapies; the type of therapy a clinician provides cannot be assumed based on discipline. If asked by a patient or referring physician, therapists should provide information about the type of therapy they provide and training they have received.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4067893062\"><span class=\"h2\">Specialty care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mental health clinicians who provide psychotherapy (including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, <span class=\"nowrap\">marital/family</span> therapists, and psychiatric nurses) may work in individual and group mental health practices and clinics, or within departments of mental health, psychiatry, or psychology departments in general-medical hospitals or ambulatory centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71601971\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients receiving treatment for a nonpsychotic psychiatric disorder in the United States receive treatment in primary care rather than in the mental health specialty sector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Mental health care in primary care has distinctive characteristics compared to mental health specialty care including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are much more likely to receive pharmacotherapy than psychotherapy in primary care, compared to the mental health specialty setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are more likely to be treated for depression or an anxiety disorder in primary care, and less likely to be treated for a psychotic disorder.</p><p/><p>Because patients with psychiatric disorders frequently present in primary care, and mental health specialty care may be unavailable or unacceptable to the patient, numerous interventions have been developed and tested to enhance or expand mental health care in primary care. These models include training of primary care clinicians to provide evidence-based psychotherapy, as well as structural changes to primary care known as integrated care. Although numerous models have been studied, they are not widely implemented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1681009\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary care clinicians with psychotherapy training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials have found that primary care clinicians and nurses who receive training in an evidence-based psychotherapy can achieve improved outcomes compared to a control intervention, particularly when working with patients with major depression or excessive alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-30</a>]. </p><p>Because primary care clinicians are subject to competing demands and time constraints, researchers are working to identify patient subgroups that can be effectively treated with briefer versions of evidence-based psychotherapies (shorter session lengths and fewer sessions). Patients with more severe, complex, or refractory conditions may be better suited for referral to mental health specialty care. </p><p>Brief psychological treatments in primary care typically involve between two and ten sessions on a weekly basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In its most basic form, integration may consist of co-location of clinicians. However, observational studies suggest that integrated models may be more effective if systematic communication and coordination occur between primary care and mental health clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-psychotherapies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Collaborative care is provided by teams of primary care clinicians and mental health specialists in the primary care setting.

Psychotherapies shown to be effective for individual psychiatric disorders include (see <a href=\"#H154312384\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cognitive and behavioral psychotherapies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interpersonal psychotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Motivational interviewing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dialectical behavior therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supportive psychotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Family therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Psychoeducation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapy can be useful intervention for the following indications (see <a href=\"#H432862411\" class=\"local\">'Indications for psychotherapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of a psychiatric disorder, with the goal of reducing or ameliorating symptoms and improving functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Changing maladaptive thoughts, behaviors, or relationships.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Providing support when a crisis, a difficult period, or a chronic problem impairs functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enhancing a patient&rsquo;s capacity to make behavioral changes (eg, losing weight, quitting smoking, or increasing adherence to medical treatment).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Helping ameliorate a relational problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increasing family cooperation in enhancing treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapy is provided by many different types of clinicians, including psychiatrists and other physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and marriage and family therapists. However, many types of psychotherapy require specialized training. If asked by a patient or referring physician, therapists should provide information about the type of therapy they provide and training they have received. (See <a href=\"#H71600832\" class=\"local\">'Staff and setting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients receiving treatment for a psychiatric disorder in the United States do so in primary care rather than in the mental health specialty sector. Evidence-based psychotherapy is not generally available in primary care. Models of mental health care delivery in the primary care setting shown to be effective but have not been widely implemented.
