The most common drug-induced WCT is a form of polymorphic VT called torsades de pointes (TdP). This arrhythmia is associated with QT interval prolongation when the patient is in sinus rhythm. Many medications (eg, antiarrhythmic drugs, anti-infective drugs, psychotropic drugs, etc) are known to prolong the QT interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a>) and are associated with a risk of polymorphic VT.

These drugs, especially class IC agents, slow conduction and have a property of &quot;use-dependency&quot; (a progressive decrease in impulse conduction velocity and wider QRS complex duration at faster heart rates). As a result, these drugs can cause rate-related aberration and a wide QRS complex during any SVT. However, they can also cause VT with a very wide, bizarre QRS, which may be incessant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

In series of unselected patients, VT accounted for up to 80 percent of cases of WCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/2,4,5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,11</a>]. VT frequency can exceed 90 percent in patients with structural heart disease (eg, those with a prior myocardial infarction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) results in WCT much less frequently than VT. Among patients with WCT due to SVT, aberrant conduction is the most common reason for a widened QRS (21 percent of cases in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Patients with WCT typically present with one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope or presyncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden cardiac arrest</p><p/><p>Few physical examination findings in patients with a WCT are unique to WCT.

Patients with underlying heart disease in whom heart failure results from the WCT may have crackles on lung examination.</p><p>In addition, the physical examination in patients with WCT can reveal evidence of atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, which is present in up to 75 percent of patients with VT, although it is not always easy to detect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/5,7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,12</a>]. During AV dissociation, the normal coordination of atrial and ventricular contraction is lost, which may produce characteristic physical findings. The presence of AV dissociation strongly suggests VT, although its absence is less helpful.</p><p>Although AV dissociation is typically diagnosed on the electrocardiogram (ECG), characteristic physical examination findings include (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'AV dissociation'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked fluctuations in the blood pressure because of the variability in the degree of left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, stroke volume, and cardiac output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variability in the occurrence and intensity of heart sounds (especially S1) (&quot;cacophony of heart sounds&quot;), which is heard more frequently when the rate of the tachycardia is slower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannon &quot;A&quot; waves &ndash; Cannon A waves are intermittent and irregular jugular venous pulsations of greater amplitude than normal waves. They reflect simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation, resulting in contraction of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve. Prominent A waves can also be seen during some SVTs. Such prominent waves result from simultaneous atrial and ventricular contraction occurring with every beat.

Compared with a normally conducted supraventricular beat (which activates the ventricular myocardium via the normal atrioventricular [AV] node-His-Purkinje system), ventricular activation during VT is slower and proceeds in a different sequence. Thus, the QRS complex is wide and abnormal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81690\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef81690 \">waveform 1</a>). As there may be slight changes of the activation sequence during the VT, reflecting the abnormal pathway of impulse conduction, there may be subtle changes in QRS complex morphology or in the ST-T waves.</p><p>VT may be either monomorphic (having a uniform and a fairly stable QRS morphology during an episode), polymorphic (having a continuously varying QRS complex morphology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> axis during an episode), or bidirectional (in which every other beat has a different axis as it travels alternately down different conduction pathways).

In addition, the pathway of conduction to the ventricles is fixed and the same for each impulse, accounting for the uniformity of the QRS complexes and ST-T waves.

Thus, if time allows, review of a baseline ECG can be helpful in differentiating VT from SVT with aberrancy. The presence of a conduction abnormality on the baseline ECG does not prove that the tachycardia is SVT with aberrancy, but the more similar the QRS during the WCT is to the QRS during sinus rhythm, the more likely it is that the WCT is an SVT with aberrancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with aberrancy at baseline who manifest a WCT in which the QRS complex is narrower than the baseline QRS, the WCT is likely VT originating near the ventricular septum, with early engagement of the specialized conducting system.

There is no single criterion or combination of criteria that provides complete diagnostic accuracy in evaluating a WCT. It is typically necessary, therefore, to integrate multiple ECG findings into a diagnostic strategy. Several strategies have been proposed, of which the Brugada criteria are the most widely known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/16,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Brugada criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>However, because the diagnosis of a WCT cannot always be made with complete certainty even when using multiple ECG criteria, an unknown or uncertain rhythm should be presumed to be VT in the absence of contrary evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. VT is far more common than supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), by a factor of four in unselected populations and by as much as 10-fold in patients with prior myocardial infarction. Additionally, presuming VT guards against inappropriate and potentially dangerous therapies directed at an SVT which can precipitate hemodynamic deterioration in patients with VT, and treatment of SVT as if it were VT is safe and frequently effective in restoring sinus rhythm.

The approach to a narrow QRS complex tachycardia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601167816\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG initial impressions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a WCT has been identified on the ECG, prompt diagnosis and management is important. Unstable patients should be presumed to have VT and treated as such. While the Brugada criteria are the most widely known and applied criteria for distinguishing VT from SVT, time <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> technical limitations may not allow for immediate review of the ECG in such detail, particularly in a symptomatic or borderline unstable patient. Our approach emphasizes immediate ECG review for key high-yield features in parallel with a brief history that can guide the management of most patients with a WCT.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the rhythm regular or irregular? &ndash; VT and most SVTs are generally regular, though slight variation of the RR interval can be seen in VT. An irregular WCT usually represents atrial fibrillation (AF) with aberrant conduction, although polymorphic VT should also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Basic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the QRS axis? &ndash; A right superior axis (axis from -90 to &plusmn;180 degrees) strongly favors VT, as does any axis shift of greater than 40 degrees when compared with baseline or concordance of the QRS complexes. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Basic features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Concordance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there atrioventricular (AV) dissociation? &ndash; If AV dissociation can be quickly identified, an atrial rate slower than the ventricular rate, along with any fusion or capture beats, strongly suggests VT. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'AV dissociation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of heart disease or arrhythmias? &ndash; A quick history focusing on structural heart disease, particularly coronary heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prior myocardial infarction, as well as any known arrhythmias or cardiac implantable electronic devices (eg, pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]), can aid in identifying the most likely etiology of WCT. The WCT is far more likely to be VT in patients over 35 years of age with known coronary heart disease or prior myocardial infarction, and in those with an ICD. (See <a href=\"#H601166120\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The absence of the historical or ECG features of VT does not confirm a diagnosis of SVT. The diagnosis of SVT should be considered primarily in young patients, whose hearts are structurally normal, in whom none of the historical (eg, family history of sudden cardiac death), physical, or ECG criteria supporting VT are present, or in patients with a history of SVT with a similar presentation. When the diagnosis of a WCT remains uncertain, we recommend that the patient be treated as if the rhythm is VT until definitively proven otherwise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Brugada criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Brugada criteria, which are the most commonly used ECG algorithm to differentiate VT from SVT, are a stepwise approach in which four criteria for VT are sequentially assessed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73159\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73159 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If any of the criteria are satisfied, the diagnosis of VT is made, and if none are fulfilled, an SVT is diagnosed. An exception is an antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.</p><p>The steps are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leads V1-V6 are inspected to detect an RS complex. If there are no RS complexes, concordance is present and the diagnosis of VT can be made. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Concordance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an RS complex is present, measure the interval between the onset of the R wave and the nadir of the S wave (RS interval). If the longest RS interval in any lead is &gt;100 msec and the R wave is wider than the S wave, the diagnosis of VT can be made. This reflects that with VT, the entire QRS complex is wide and abnormal (even the initial R wave portion), while aberration is due to a terminal delay resulting in a wider terminal portion of the QRS complex (ie, S wave).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This criterion, however, may be limited in the presence of an underlying diffuse cardiomyopathy, as in this situation even initial ventricular activation may be slow and abnormal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the longest RS interval is &lt;100 msec, the presence or absence of AV dissociation is assessed. If AV dissociation is seen, the diagnosis of VT is made. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'AV dissociation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If AV dissociation cannot clearly be demonstrated, the QRS morphology criteria for V1-positive and V1-negative wide QRS complex tachycardias are considered. QRS morphology criteria consistent with VT must be present in leads V1 or V2 and in lead V6 to diagnose VT. If either the V1-V2 or the V6 criteria are not consistent with VT, an SVT is assumed. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'QRS morphology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several alternative approaches have been proposed in the literature, although none are as commonly used as the Brugada criteria. These approaches are generally best performed in consultation with an electrophysiologist with expertise in the diagnosis of WCT.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative algorithm (Vereckei approach) uses a stepwise approach similar to the Brugada criteria, but includes different ECG features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79624\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79624 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Two unique features of this algorithm include an initial R wave in aVR (diagnostic of VT), and the Vi:Vt ratio. Vi and Vt are the magnitude of voltage change in the initial and terminal 40 msec of a QRS, respectively. Vi and Vt should be measured from the same biphasic or multiphasic QRS complex. A Vi:Vt ratio &le;1 is diagnostic of VT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One study of 51 patients with WCT induced during electrophysiology study showed equivalent sensitivity for diagnosis between the Vereckei and Brugada approaches (89 versus 90 percent), but the Vereckei approach yielded significantly fewer incorrect diagnoses following the first step (2 versus 27 percent) and was slightly faster to perform (9.1 versus 9.9 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Bayesian approach utilizes likelihood ratios (LR) for six ECG criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients are presumed to start with a &quot;prior odds ratio&quot; of 4.0 (4:1) in favor of VT. As each criterion is evaluated sequentially, the associated LR is multiplied by the prior odds ratio to calculate the new probability of VT. The final odds ratio (posterior probability) is considered consistent with VT if the value is &ge;1.0, and SVT if the value is &lt;1.0.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> may be administered as both a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic agent.

Because there is direct myocardial activation since ventricular activation begins outside of the normal conduction system in both VT and antidromic AVRT, many of the standard criteria are not able to discriminate antidromic AVRT from VT. The clinical significance of this problem is often limited, however, because preexcitation is an uncommon cause of WCT (6 percent in one series), particularly if other clinical factors (eg, age, underlying heart disease) suggest VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>For cases in which preexcitation is thought to be likely (such as a young patient without structural heart disease, or a patient with a known accessory pathway), a separate algorithm was developed which consists of the following three steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59336\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59336 \">algorithm 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predominant polarity of the QRS complex in leads V4 through V6 is defined either as positive or negative.

If a 1:1 AV relationship is not present and there are more QRS complexes present than P waves, VT can be diagnosed.</p><p/><p>When any of these criteria are met, VT is likely. However, if the ECG does not display any of the three morphologic characteristics diagnostic of VT in this algorithm, the diagnosis of antidromic AVRT must be considered. Importantly, the QRS complex morphology and ST-T waves are uniform with AVRT as every impulse to the ventricle is conducted through the same accessory pathway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Algorithm performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Algorithms often perform well in initial reports.
