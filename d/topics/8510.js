However, the pathogenesis is somewhat different in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).</p><p>Hypertension is a common early finding in ADPKD, occurring in 50 to 70 percent of cases before any significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with an average age onset of 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, the tendency to develop hypertension and its complications begins even earlier (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Affected young adults have a higher ambulatory blood pressure and left ventricular mass index than age-matched controls, even though the values remain within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This raises the possibility that treatment of normotensive ADPKD patients may be beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and extracellular volume expansion are often present early in ADPKD (ie, prior to elevation in the serum creatinine) and may play an important role in the rise in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It has been suggested that cyst expansion, leading to focal areas of renal ischemia and enhanced renin release, is largely responsible for at least the initial rise in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Two observations are compatible with this hypothesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renin-containing cells are present in the attenuated arteries in the walls of the cysts and in cells in the connective tissue surrounding cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Renin can also be produced by the epithelial cells lining the cysts, and active renin is often present within the cyst fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Renin may directly promote epithelial cell hyperplasia and cyst growth since angiotensin II is a growth factor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of early hypertension varies with the degree of structural change as patients with normal serum creatinine with an elevated blood pressure tend to have a higher total cyst volume than those who are normotensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>The role of sodium retention and vasoactive hormones in the genesis of hypertension is less clear. Although aldosterone and vasopressin levels may be elevated in hypertensive ADPKD patients and patients with ADPKD may be slightly volume expanded, their plasma volume is similar to normotensive patients with ADPKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,11</a>]. The circulating levels of prostaglandins and norepinephrine are not different between hypertensive and normotensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Importantly, measurement of renal blood flow utilizing para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance techniques or breath-held magnetic resonance (MR) angiography demonstrates a relative decline in total renal blood flow that correlates with cyst burden (kidney volume) that responds to inhibition of the RAS. Renal blood flow, similar to hypertension, is a risk factor for progressive renal disease in ADPKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13300641\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS OF BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure is commonly monitored by using office (OBPM) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> self-measured home readings (HBPM). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered as the gold-standard noninvasive method but, due to its high cost and inconvenience for patients, is only indicated in cases of suspicion for white-coat or masked hypertension, noncompliance, or drug resistance or hypotensive symptoms while on antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults#H1749547939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications for ABPM'</a>.)</p><p>Available data from essential hypertensives suggest that blood pressures are comparable when measured by ABPM or HBPM and that both of these methods are more accurate than OBPM. The effect of antihypertensive therapy on systolic blood pressure (SBP; and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) can be 10 points higher in the office than at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In ADPKD, ABPM is superior to OBPM in diagnosing hypertension and prehypertensive states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<sup> </sup>A study of 36 young (age 21 to 31 years) ADPKD patients with normal renal function and office blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/90</span> mmHg revealed that 6 of 36 patients (16.7 percent) were hypertensive based on ABPM. ABPM is the only method that provides information on nocturnal blood pressure levels and &quot;the nocturnal dipping&quot; (&gt;10 percent drop in SBP during the night compared with daytime), which has been suggested as a protective factor against the development of end organ damage. Amplitude of nocturnal dipping is lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and nondipping is more common in ADPKD (present in 40 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">prehypertensive/hypertensive</span> subjects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the reproducibility of nocturnal dipping is modest in ADPKD, limiting its clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. One study has shown a positive correlation between average 24-hour SBP and left ventricular mass index in normotensive and hypertensive ADPKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Another study showed a positive correlation between ABPM readings, kidney volume, and the number of renal cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large number of widely available antihypertensive agents and increased clinician awareness of the importance of blood pressure control have resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of antihypertensive medications (particularly renin-angiotensin system [RAS] inhibitors) over the last 30 years. Data from the University of Colorado ADPKD center (a tertiary subspecialized referral center) comparing the two periods of 1985 to 1989 and 1995 to 1999 showed an increase in the use of RAS inhibitors from 19 to 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, registry data from Denmark demonstrate a four- to five-year delay to end-stage renal failure in those individuals receiving RAS inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios indicated that, compared with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be more cost effective due to lower costs and similar life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In addition, a comprehensive review of the electronic patient records of 1877 adults with ADPKD from the United Kingdom General Practice Database between 1991 and 2008 showed a dramatic increase (from 32 to 62 percent) in the use of antihypertensive therapy in patients with ADPKD. The use of RAS inhibitors increased from 7 to 46 percent. The management of hypertension resulted in a drop in average blood pressure from <span class=\"nowrap\">142/85</span> mmHg in 1991 to <span class=\"nowrap\">133/80</span> in 2008. More interestingly, mortality rates decreased significantly during the same time period, most likely due to a better control of blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3984957\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36739379\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there are no contraindications, an ACE inhibitor should be the initial antihypertensive agent. An ARB could be considered in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. However, combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and ARB provides no additional benefit to that of an ACE inhibitor alone.</p><p>Careful monitoring is indicated in high-risk patients after institution of an ACE inhibitor or following an episode of volume depletion or cyst hemorrhage in someone already being treated with one of these agents. Patients who develop an acute, clinically significant elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration may be more safely treated with another agent, such as a calcium channel blocker; however, some experts prefer to use a beta blocker as a second agent, given the potentially detrimental effects of calcium blockers on cyst formation. Diuretics may be considered for patients who do not have adequate blood pressure control on an ACE inhibitor alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36739339\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hypertension and ADPKD generally respond well to an ACE inhibitor (and probably ARBs) since, as described above, focal ischemia induced by the cysts stimulates the RAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>]. A separate issue is whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs protect against secondary glomerular injury, as they do in other chronic renal diseases, in part by reducing the intraglomerular pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glomerular hypertrophy. Secondary glomerular injury appears to be less important in ADPKD since glomerulosclerosis is not a feature of progressive renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Course and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is possible that ADPKD patients who have proteinuria might have a slower rate of progression of kidney disease with ACE inhibitors. A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials of progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) provided some evidence in support of this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There were 142 patients with a diagnosis of ADPKD; mean protein excretion was 920 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which, in a larger study of patients with ADPKD, was present in &lt;20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This suggests possible selection bias for ADPKD patients with proteinuria or proteinuric patients who might have secondary glomerular injury or other factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, urinary protein excretion significantly decreased in the ACE inhibitor group compared with the control group (-0.33 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> versus +0.19 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. This benefit was greater in those with higher levels of baseline urine protein excretion. There was also a nonsignificant trend for a decreased incidence of progression of renal dysfunction with ACE inhibitor therapy (29 versus 41 percent, p = 0.17).</p><p>A study that was not included in the previous meta-analysis found that effective blood pressure control with an ACE inhibitor (or a calcium channel blocker) appeared to delay the onset of renal failure. In this prospective study, 24 patients with ADPKD, hypertension, and creatinine clearances &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> (a calcium channel blocker) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At five years, there was a similar degree of blood pressure control and preservation of renal function, with a mean yearly decline in creatinine clearance of approximately 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. These findings compare favorably with the rate of progression in patients with ADPKD but uncontrolled hypertension (declines of 5.8 and 5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 in Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] studies A and B, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, enalapril, but not amlodipine, had a consistent antiproteinuric effect, but the ability to lower proteinuria did not correlate with the preservation of kidney function in these patients.</p><p>A nonrandomized trial comparing the renal outcomes of 14 patients on a diuretic and 19 patients on an ACE inhibitor showed similar blood pressure control with both agents over a mean follow-up period of 5.2 years, but the annual decrease in creatinine clearance was significantly higher in the diuretic group (5.3 versus 2.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Additionally, urinary protein excretion was significantly increased in the diuretic group but not in the ACE inhibitor group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This small study suggested that diuretics may not be an optimal first-line choice for treatment of hypertension in ADPKD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36739385\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiotensin receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the use of ARBs in ADPKD. A randomized trial of 49 hypertensive patients with ADPKD compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The blood pressure was equally well controlled in both groups.

There was no difference between groups in the composite endpoint of death, end-stage renal disease, or 50 percent reduction in eGFR. Rates of decline in eGFR were not different between groups. Albumin excretion and adverse events, including hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury, were infrequent and not different between groups. Therefore, although well tolerated and safely administered, there is no indication to combine ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy in hypertensive ADPKD individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second trial with a 2x2 factorial design, 558 patients with eGFR &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned to either an ACE inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a>) plus an ARB (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=telmisartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telmisartan</a>) or to lisinopril plus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. There were no differences between groups in the annual percentage increase in total kidney volume, the rate of decline of eGFR, the urinary albumin excretion, or left ventricular mass index.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36739373\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications of angiotensin inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential complication of angiotensin inhibition in patients with ADPKD is a reversible, acute decline in GFR, with the serum creatinine usually rising by &lt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This complication occurs in less than 5 percent of cases and is seen primarily in patients with underlying renal insufficiency and massive cystic disease. Concurrent diuretic use and hemorrhage into a cyst (which can lead to intravascular volume contraction) are additional risk factors.</p><p>The fall in GFR related to angiotensin inhibition probably results from interference with autoregulation via a mechanism similar to that seen in bilateral renal artery stenosis. In ADPKD, however, the vascular disease is intrarenal due primarily to vascular sclerosis of uncertain etiology that appears to be associated with progressive ADPKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is not clear if the vascular lesions are the result or in part the cause of the hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important consideration in selecting an antihypertensive agent is that hypertensive women with ADPKD are frequently of childbearing age. Since exposure to ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be associated with serious adverse fetal effects that can occur in the earliest stages of pregnancy, women in childbearing years should be counseled about the potential risks of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and, if possible, should switch to alternate antihypertensive drugs prior to planned pregnancy.

This matter is further complicated by defining the appropriate modality (office, home, or 24-hour ambulatory) of blood pressure monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H13300641\" class=\"local\">'Methods of blood pressure monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p>For all ADPKD patients, we believe that goal blood pressure should be <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/80</span> mmHg, based on office blood pressure readings. For selected patients (particularly young, healthy individuals with relatively intact kidney function), we believe a lower blood pressure target (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;110/75</span> mmHg) can provide cardiovascular benefit and reduce the rate of cyst growth. However, although safe, achieving such low blood pressures is likely to be associated with an increased frequency of symptoms of dizziness and fatigue. Usually, such symptoms occur during dose titration and can be managed by temporary dose reduction until symptoms abate.</p><p>Two studies have compared renal outcomes of various blood pressure goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>].

Albumin excretion decreased (by 3.9 percent) in the low-target group and increased (by 2.4 percent) in the standard-target group.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), possibly caused by focal ischemia due to cyst expansion, and extracellular volume expansion may play an important role in the rise in blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ambulatory blood pressure may be helpful to diagnose hypertension and is indicated in untreated (and especially young adults) with borderline high office blood pressure and suspicion of white-coat hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are no contraindications, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be the initial antihypertensive agent. Careful monitoring is indicated in high-risk patients after institution of an ACE inhibitor or following an episode of volume depletion or cyst hemorrhage in someone already being treated with one of these agents. An angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) could be considered in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Dual therapy with an ACE inhibitor and ARB provides no additional benefit to that provided by an ACE inhibitor alone. (See <a href=\"#H3984957\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop a clinically significant elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration may be more safely treated with another agent, such as a calcium channel blocker; some experts prefer to use a beta blocker as a second agent given the potentially detrimental effects of calcium blockers on cyst formation. Use of diuretics should be considered after using an RAS inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H3984957\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goal blood pressure should be to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/80</span> mmHg based on office blood pressure readings. It is possible that a blood pressure goal <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;110/75</span> mmHg may decrease the rate of increase in kidney volume and provide cardiovascular benefit among young, healthy hypertensive ADPKD patients.
