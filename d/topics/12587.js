Sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to any one of the syndromes in which the sickle mutation is co-inherited with a mutation at the other beta globin allele that reduces or abolishes normal beta globin production. These include sickle cell anemia (homozygous sickle mutation), sickle beta thalassemia, hemoglobin SC disease, and others.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of SCD are protean. The major features are related to hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion, which can lead to acute and chronic pain and tissue ischemia or infarction. Splenic infarction leads to functional hyposplenism early in life, which in turn increases the risk of infection. These complications have a major impact on morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This topic review presents an overview of the major clinical manifestations of SCD.

The majority of patients do not have successful transitions to an adult provider and as a result lack appropriate preventative care. The causes of this lapse in care are multifactorial and include lack of adult providers with expertise in SCD, lack of effective communication between pediatric and adult providers, and inadequate insurance coverage. Another major problem is the lack of skill development in the adolescent to become independent. There are validated self-efficacy and readiness tools that predict the success of transfer. An approach to pediatric-to-adult transfer using appropriate training and self-efficacy tools must be established during the early years before patients are transferred to adult care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Pain is one of the major consequences. Patients may have intermittent episodes of acute pain, which in some cases is accompanied by underlying chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute painful episodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of acute pain are one of the most common types of vaso-occlusive events in SCD and are responsible for a large number of patient encounters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. While these episodes were previously called &quot;sickle cell crises&quot; (and still are referred to as crises by many providers), we prefer to use the term painful episodes because not all patients are in true crisis, and pain should not be allowed to progress to the point of crisis for patients to receive appropriate analgesia including opioid analgesics if indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, pain can be a SCD complication in and of itself, and pain can co-occur with (and mask) other potentially life-threatening complications of SCD. Treatment of pain should be accompanied by additional evaluations as appropriate for these complications, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H204999190\" class=\"local\">'Potentially serious complications associated with acute pain'</a> below.)</p><p>Vaso-occlusive pain in SCD is intense, although there is significant variability in the severity and frequency of acute painful episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The majority of pain episodes are managed by the patient at home, with up to a third of patients having pain as often as daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,11</a>]. Pain may be accompanied by tissue ischemia and inflammation. Many patients have specific triggers for pain such as cold, wind, low humidity, dehydration, stress, alcohol, and menses, which they develop strategies to minimize or avoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. However, the majority of painful episodes have no identifiable cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis and triggers for pain'</a>.)</p><p>Pain episodes can begin as early as six months of age and typically last throughout life. In a series of children diagnosed with SCD at birth, one-third had experienced pain by the age of one year, two-thirds by the age of two years, and over 90 percent by the age of six [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The sites of pain can include the back, chest, extremities, and abdomen. In young children, dactylitis (acute pain in the hands or feet) may be the most common site of pain.</p><p>Acute pain should be assessed rapidly so as not to delay analgesia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease#H989683048\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pain in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment of pain'</a>):</p><p>The gold standard for the assessment of pain is the patient&rsquo;s report. There is no combination of physical findings or laboratory tests that can be used to determine (or confirm) whether an individual with SCD is in pain. The absence of hemolysis or the stability of the hemoglobin level cannot be used to justify withholding or underdosing of pain medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Placebo should never be used as it undermines the physician-patient relationship and lengthens the duration of pain.</p><p>Management of acute pain is individualized. Pain typically is managed by the patient or family at home; most patients only present to the hospital or emergency department when their pain has exceeded what they can manage at home with oral opioids. Provider misconceptions about the nature and severity of SCD pain that interfere with adequate pain assessment and treatment should be addressed.
