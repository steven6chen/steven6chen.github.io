These drugs differ with respect to mechanism of action and to the degree and type of lipid lowering. Thus, the indications for a particular drug are influenced by the underlying lipid abnormality. Conventional dosing regimens and common adverse reactions are described in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77498\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77498 \">table 1</a>) and the range of expected changes in the lipid profile are listed in a separate table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75715\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75715 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Lipid lowering, at least with statins, is beneficial for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in patients with dyslipidemias.

Regression of atherosclerosis occurs in only a minority of patients; furthermore, clinical benefits of lipid lowering are seen in as little as six months, before significant regression could occur. Thus, other factors must contribute; these include plaque stabilization, reversal of endothelial dysfunction, and decreased thrombogenicity.

In another study of 105,329 Medicare beneficiaries following hospitalization for myocardial infarction, statin down-titration or discontinuation compared with adherence to high-intensity statin therapy over a median of 1.9 to 2.3 years of follow-up was associated with an increased risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.30-1.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Some patients do not tolerate statin therapy even after changing to a different statin, reducing the dose, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> using alternate-day dosing.

A review of adverse events reported to the FDA between November 1997 and February 2002 found 60 reports of patients who had memory loss associated with statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

A systematic review of randomized trials and observational studies found that published data do not suggest that statins harm cognition; however, the quality of the evidence was felt to be only low to moderate, particularly with regard to high-intensity statin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

However, randomized trials can fail to detect rare medication side effects. A large database observational study found an association between first exposure to statin therapy and acute memory loss (within 30 days); however, the same association was found for other lipid-lowering agents and the authors thought it more likely that the result reflected detection bias rather than a true causal effect of multiple lipid-lowering therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Experimental evidence has been conflicting about whether statins as a group improve glucose metabolism or whether some statins show beneficial effects while others show harmful effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/86-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-91</a>].</p><p>Some clinical trials of statins had reported conflicting results on the issue of glucose metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-95</a>]. However, a 2010 meta-analysis of 13 trials (n = 91,140) found little evidence of heterogeneity among large-scale chronic treatment trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. For inclusion, trials were required to have more than 1000 patients and a duration of follow-up of more than one year. This meta-analysis found an overall small increased risk for diabetes in patients treated with statins (OR for incident diabetes 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17). Subgroup analyses found very similar diabetes risks in trials of hydrophilic or lipophilic statins, and no clear differences among individual statins. The results were also similar after the exclusion of the JUPITER trial. Since JUPITER had raised much of the concern about diabetes and statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], the stability of the result without JUPITER lowers the likelihood that the glucose findings in the meta-analysis were due to chance.</p><p>A 2011 meta-analysis of five randomized trials (n = 32,752) also found an increased risk of incident diabetes with intensive statin therapy compared with moderate statin therapy (OR 1.12, CI 1.04-1.22) with little or no heterogeneity across trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. This translates into approximately one additional case of diabetes for every 500 patients treated with intensive rather than moderate statin therapy. Similarly, a large observational study using administrative data found a higher risk of diabetes with high-potency statins, an intermediate risk with moderate-potency statins, and a lower risk with low-potency statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>A 2015 meta-analysis confirmed these results both for the risk of diabetes with statins versus placebo (OR 1.11, CI 1.03-1.20) and for intensive versus moderate-intensity statin therapy (OR 1.12, 1.04-1.22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. This study also included a Mendelian randomization study (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mendelian-randomization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mendelian randomization&quot;</a>) that found that decreased genetic hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase activity is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, such that at least some of the risk seen with statin therapy appears to be due to its on-target effect of inhibiting HMG CoA reductase. This is important because it means that this side effect of statins cannot likely be eliminated while maintaining the primary efficacy of statin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>A 2016 analysis estimated that high-dose statin therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 40 mg daily) would lead to 50 to 100 new cases of diabetes in 10,000 treated individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cancer </strong>&ndash; There is no convincing evidence that statins increase or decrease the risk of cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As discussed elsewhere, meta-analyses of randomized trials have shown no effect of statins on cancer incidence or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-104</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-possible-noncardiovascular-benefits#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins: Possible noncardiovascular benefits&quot;, section on 'Cancer'</a>).

While it may be possible to use statins safely in patients with mild cholestasis who have an appropriate indication for therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>], we avoid statin therapy in patients with significant cholestasis unless there are compelling indications such as established atherosclerotic vascular disease that is considered clinically important.
