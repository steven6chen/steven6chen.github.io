However, many clinical presentations of drug hypersensitivity are more complex or take place in the setting of illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polypharmacotherapy. The patient in intensive care who develops a rash while receiving multiple medications, or the ambulatory patient with complex chronic diseases who develops a new and unexplained symptom while taking many medications, illustrates two common presentations of drug allergy.</p><p>The main questions that arise in such situations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the adverse event related to a drug?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If so, which drug is responsible?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the reaction due to an immune response to the drug (ie, true drug allergy) or due to another mechanism, such as pseudoallergy?

There are different classification systems for drug allergy, which are briefly reviewed here and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunologic drug reactions are divided into four categories according to the Gell and Coombs system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; Immediate in onset and caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; Delayed in onset and caused by antibody (usually immunoglobulin G [IgG])-mediated cell destruction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III &ndash; Delayed in onset and caused by immune complex (IgG:drug) deposition and complement activation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV &ndash; Delayed in onset and T cell mediated</p><p/><p>The classification of a drug-allergic reaction is important in determining appropriate diagnostic procedures, options for further treatment, and possible cross-reactivity with similar medications.</p><p>The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has recommended dividing immunologic drug reactions into two types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate reactions, occurring within one hour of the first administered dose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed reactions, occurring after one hour, but usually more than six hours and occasionally weeks to months after the start of administration</p><p/><p>The WAO distinction between immediate and delayed drug reactions is helpful in distinguishing type I, IgE-mediated reactions from the other types. Type I reactions carry the risk of immediate life-threatening anaphylaxis if the drug is readministered. These reactions most commonly appear within minutes after exposure, but may begin after one hour following oral administration, especially if the drug is taken with food, which further slows absorption.</p><p>Delayed reactions are usually not IgE mediated, and result instead from types II, III, and mainly type IV hypersensitivity, or from multiple or unknown pathophysiologic mechanisms. Some of these reactions can also be life threatening, and as a group, delayed reactions probably account for more deaths than anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug pseudoallergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pseudoallergic drug reaction is a reaction that is similar or identical in presentation to an immunologic reaction, but is NOT mediated by the immune system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79967\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79967 \">table 2</a>). The term &quot;nonimmune-mediated hypersensitivity&quot; is also used. Pseudoallergic reactions, such as those to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can be as severe as IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and are managed acutely in the same manner (ie, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>). However, the evaluation and future prevention of these reactions is different from that of immunologic reactions. Pseudoallergic drug reactions are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Pseudoallergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR DRUG ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for the development of drug allergy include the female sex, prior history of drug allergic reactions, recurrent drug exposure, genetic factors, and certain disease states.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Female sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women are at greater risk than men for allergic reactions to some drugs, for reasons that are not well defined. Women can experience higher rates of both immediate and delayed reactions. As an example of the latter, women of childbearing age developed delayed-onset rashes to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a> (a quinolone) in 30 percent of administrations, compared with 3 percent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Intraoperative reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents are also much more frequent in women. In contrast, neither immediate nor delayed allergic reactions to penicillins differ by gender.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior history of allergic drug reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prior history of allergic reactions to one or more drugs increases the risk of developing additional drug allergies. This is obviously true in patients with past drug reactions who are subsequently given the same or a related medication. It is also true with pseudoallergic reactions due to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), since structurally different NSAIDs may cause similar reactions. Pseudoallergic reactions are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Pseudoallergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple drug allergy syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;multiple drug allergy syndrome&quot; has been used to describe different conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It was initially used to describe patients with past drug-allergic reactions, especially immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent reactions, who were at increased risk for reactions to unrelated drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One prospective study showed that patients with antibiotic sensitivity by history had a 10-fold increased risk for allergic reactions to unrelated antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A wide variety of clinical reactions were observed in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other researchers applied the term &quot;multiple drug allergy syndrome&quot; to patients who reacted to antibiotics and often various NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These reactions were typically urticaria or mild, transient rashes. Some of these patients had underlying chronic urticaria, which is a main differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent &quot;rashes&quot; after various, chemically unrelated medications. The majority of such patients are classified as having pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs or NSAID intolerance, but some appear to react to other drugs as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequently, the term &quot;multiple drug allergy syndrome&quot; has been used more narrowly to describe persons who had experienced well-documented immunologic drug reactions (of any Gell and Coombs type) to two or more chemically-unrelated medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This appears to arise because of an enhanced responsiveness of the patient's T cells to pharmaceutical substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The implicated drugs are often antibiotics, although hypnotics, antidepressants, local anesthetics, glucocorticoids, and other drug classes were also reported. In a typical clinical scenario, a patient might initially develop drug-induced hypersensitivity <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/drug</span> reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">DiHS/DRESS,</span> a type IV reaction) to an antiepileptic drug. After this event, the patient develops additional drug allergies. The nature of subsequent reactions depends upon the <span class=\"nowrap\">structure/type</span> of allergy normally associated with the drug in question. For example, if the same patient is later given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, the reaction is typically an exanthema. If given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, another <span class=\"nowrap\">DiHS/DRESS</span> reaction may ensue. <span class=\"nowrap\">DiHS/DRESS</span> reactions are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Multiple drug allergy syndrome should <strong>not</strong> be applied to the numerous patients who report adverse reactions to many drugs, in whom symptoms are often not typical of immunologic reactions. Rather, &quot;multiple drug intolerance&quot; may be a more appropriate description.</p><p>When multiple unrelated drugs elicit very similar symptoms, with immediate or slightly delayed onset, a role for conditioned responses needs to be considered. It is not immunologically plausible that structurally unrelated drugs should produce exactly the same syndrome, so when this is the history given by the patients (often with more than two drugs), classical Pavlovian conditioning is the most likely diagnosis, especially if the original reaction was frightening or traumatic in any way. Another clue to this diagnosis is a history of allergic-like symptoms to many drugs, including some that uncommonly cause true immunologic drug reactions (eg, macrolide antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and local anesthetics).</p><p>In conclusion, multiple drug allergy syndrome should only be used to describe patients with immunologic reactions to at least two (usually more) unrelated drugs, because such patients often need special attention and management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent drug exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeated courses of therapy with the same drugs or related drugs are associated with higher rates of drug allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may create an inflammatory milieu that enhances drug allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/3,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32</a>]. A similar phenomenon is seen in generalized herpes virus infections. Indeed, activated, atypical lymphocytes are frequently found in the circulation of persons infected with either of these viruses.

Although some initial studies suggested that slow acetylation or low glutathione levels might influence the frequency of drug hypersensitivity to sulfonamides and other drugs, later studies did not confirm these theories. Therefore, typing for pharmacogenetic predisposition (eg, cytochrome p450 polymorphism) has not yet entered clinical practice for the purposes of assessing risk of drug allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Atopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atopy may be defined as an inherited phenotype that includes the predisposition to develop allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to inhaled or ingested allergens. Patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">atopic/allergic</span> disorders, such as allergic asthma or food allergy, are not at increased risk for the development of drug allergy. However, atopic conditions may aggravate the clinical manifestations of IgE-mediated drug allergies.

If so, what type? Are the signs and symptoms suggestive of an immunologic response (ie, drug allergy)? Is the drug to which the patient was recently exposed known to cause such symptoms, or does it usually cause pseudoallergic reactions (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])? The different presentations of drug allergy and pseudoallergic reactions are summarized in the table and presented separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How severe is the reaction and what organ systems are involved? This can be assessed with a meticulous skin examination, followed by further evaluation of any other organ system that appears to be affected. A complete blood count and differential and tests of liver and renal function should be obtained. This evaluation is indicated if the exanthema is substantial, bullous or pustular, confluent, involves a substantial portion of the body surface area, or if general symptoms (malaise, skin pain, lymphadenopathy) are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which drug is responsible? This assessment can be approached in a stepwise manner:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Step 1 &ndash; Gather information, as discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Review the medical record'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Step 2 &ndash; Examine the medical record to see if temporal relationships between symptoms and the administration of specific drugs are apparent. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Review the medical record'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Step 3 &ndash; For each suspect drug, consider the likelihood of its causing the type of allergic reaction in question, based upon the published literature. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Drugs with high allergenic potential'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Step 4 &ndash; Stop or substitute <span class=\"nowrap\">any/all</span> suspect drugs with known allergic potential that demonstrate a temporal relationship with the symptoms. Observe the consequences of stopping these medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is testing possible?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Step 5 &ndash; For reactions that are suspected to be immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated, consider skin testing. (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing for drug-specific IgE'</a> below). Both skin and in vitro tests (if available) to identify the eliciting drug are normally done after the reaction has resolved completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In critically ill patients who cannot communicate, it may be the only available source of information.</p><p>One approach is the creation of a timeline of medication starts and stops, on which the appearance and resolution of symptoms is also charted. It is important to note the onset of fever or the appearance of relevant laboratory abnormalities, such as blood eosinophilia or urine eosinophilia or hematuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of the clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History alone is often not sufficient for establishing current drug sensitivity. Studies performed on large series of patients with histories of drug allergy have shown that less than 20 percent actually react to the offending drug(s) upon direct challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. There are multiple reasons why a previously reactive patient may tolerate a drug upon subsequent administration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The suspect drug may never have caused symptoms, but was implicated based upon a temporal association. This is probably the most common reason.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient could have had a true immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reaction in the past, but has lost sensitivity to the drug over time. Approximately 80 percent of patients with IgE-mediated penicillin allergy have lost the sensitivity after 10 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologic states required for reactivity may wane over time and render the patient less vulnerable. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often aggravate chronic idiopathic urticaria, but are well tolerated once the urticaria remits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgE-mediated, immediate-type allergic reactions can appear with the first known encounter with a drug, even though these types of reactions require preexisting sensitization (ie, formation of IgE antibodies) to the drug. This most often occurs with drugs that are administered intravenously. The explanation for this phenomenon is that sensitization has occurred as a result of exposure to a different but cross-reacting compound, typically a different medication or a cosmetic. The best-studied example is that of muscle relaxants (ie, neuromuscular blocking agents), which can trigger anaphylaxis upon first exposure because patients can become sensitized to over-the-counter cough remedies (pholcodine in Europe) or cosmetics (in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Some of these patients had antibodies against the oligosaccharide galactose alpha-1,3-galactose found in the drug and developed anaphylaxis upon intravenous administration of cetuximab. This oligosaccharide is also found in beef, pork, and lamb, and a subset of patients had experienced allergic reactions when eating these meats. Because most of the affected patients lived in the southeastern United States, it has been postulated that patients become sensitized to the oligosaccharide as a result of bites from ticks or other ectoparasites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs with high allergenic potential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The different types of immunologic drug reactions and the categories of drugs that are most commonly implicated in each are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77196 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">OBJECTIVE TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Objective testing may be appropriate for some types of allergic drug reactions.

Histamine may also be detectable, but assays are less reliable and elevations are seen only during a very short time interval after the reaction.</p><p>Any elevation of tryptase is consistent with anaphylaxis, although normal levels do not exclude the diagnosis. Tryptase levels should be tested again after the reaction has resolved, to detect a relative increase as well as to exclude indolent mastocytosis, an important risk factor for severe anaphylaxis. Elevations are most likely to be detectable following anaphylaxis with hemodynamic changes, and if blood is collected one to three hours from the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The interpretation of tryptase in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is not always straightforward. As an example, a tryptase level of 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> during anaphylaxis and 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> the following day is suggestive of anaphylaxis, even though both levels are below the upper limit of normal (ie, 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. In this example, the serum level tripled, which may be meaningful, since personal tryptase levels are usually quite constant. The interpretation of tryptase levels is discussed in greater detail separately.

This type of testing is only used to evaluate suspected type I allergic reactions. A positive wheal-and-flare response appearing within 15 to 20 minutes indicates the presence of drug-specific IgE on the patient's mast cells and supports the diagnosis of a type I reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The clinician must first ascertain that the medication does not cause direct mast cell degranulation, as described with opioids, quinolones, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. Medications that activate mast cells directly cannot be studied with this type of skin testing. In addition, the drug solution used for testing should not be nonspecifically irritating to the skin.

Some patients experience unintentional anticipatory reactions (classic conditioning), particularly following a true allergic reaction or a frightening experience in association with drug treatment. These can often be elicited by placebo doses, thus reassuring the clinician and patient alike that the response is not due to the drug in question.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Challenge protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pace of the challenge and degree of caution exercised depends upon the likelihood that the patient may be allergic, the patient's medical stability, and the clinician's experience and level of comfort with the procedure.</p><p>Other considerations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should NOT be premedicated with antihistamines or glucocorticoids because these agents may mask early signs of an allergic reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers taken for control of hypertension should be withheld for 24 hours before challenge, as these agents can interfere with treatment of anaphylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, should that be necessary. In contrast, beta blockers that are taken to control arrhythmias should not be withheld without consulting a cardiologist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, or other pulmonary diseases should have their pulmonary symptoms optimally controlled prior to undergoing challenge.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">For immediate reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the previous reaction occurred less than one hour after drug administration and there is concern about a possible IgE-dependent reaction, then the challenge should be performed by an allergy expert and in a setting equipped to treat anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The starting challenge dose should be low, typically between <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10,000</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> of the therapeutic dose, depending on the severity of the past reaction. Using this strategy, any symptoms that are elicited should be mild.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oral route is preferred when possible, since oral administration is generally associated with less severe symptoms compared with intravenous administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenfold increasing doses are administered every 30 to 60 minutes until the full therapeutic dose is reached. If subjective symptoms appear, the clinician can proceed more slowly by using threefold increases for one or two steps. Once the full therapeutic dose has been achieved without incident, continuous therapy should be begun immediately with appropriate monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">For delayed reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Challenge schemes for simple delayed exanthema to drugs are usually performed either in the context of research (to document sensitivity) or at a time that the patient actively needs the drug. In the latter situation, the drug may be slowly increased and the patient instructed to contact the clinician immediately if any adverse events are noted.</p><p>For delayed or nonimmediate types of reactions, challenge procedures are less standardized and are based upon the time course of the patient's reaction and the pharmacology of the drug involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The optimal approach is not known and experts have differences in practice. In general, the time between doses should be long enough that delayed symptoms have time to develop before the next higher dose is administered. Some protocols may take days or even weeks.</p><p>An example of a challenge procedure for delayed reactions to cephalosporins involved administering doses at weekly intervals, starting with <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100</span> of a usual dose on day 0, <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10</span> of a dose on day 7, and a standard dose on day 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, other studies have documented that some delayed reactions only develop after several days at a full therapeutic dose, or in the presence of a concomitant viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. Thus, there may be certain drug reactions that cannot be easily elicited with any challenge protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Other published examples of challenge protocols, when available, are discussed in specific topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H40\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfonamide allergy in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Desensitization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260179944\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative predictive value of challenge procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient tolerates a drug challenge, it is highly unlikely, but not impossible, that that drug will cause symptoms if taken again in the future. A small number of studies have examined the negative predictive value of challenges for immediate and delayed reactions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study examined the negative predictive value of drug challenges in 203 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Of these, 163 of the children underwent allergy evaluation for immediate or delayed reactions. All were labeled as &quot;not allergic to the drug&quot; based on 175 negative drug challenges, consisting of one full dose of the drug. Reevaluation after at least a three-month interval showed that 91 (52 percent) of the 175 tested drugs were reported to have been used again: 65 children took the same antibiotic, 20 took the same nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), and 6 took other drugs. An immediate reaction was reported in 5 (5.5 percent) of these (four antibiotics, one NSAID). One patient developed an anaphylactic reaction and was skin test positive upon repeat testing, suggesting either resensitization from the challenge or an error in original skin testing. The remaining false-negative challenges were delayed reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other studies have described similar findings. Recurrent reactions in spite of negative prior challenges were reported in 7.6 percent of 118 adults reexposed to the same beta-lactam antibiotic. All reactions were nonimmediate and none was severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p/><p>Such studies demonstrate that single dose challenge procedures have higher negative predictive values for immediate reactions than for delayed-onset reactions. Challenges may rarely result in resensitization and thus a prior negative challenge is <strong>not a guarantee</strong> that the drug will be tolerated, especially regarding delayed reactions. In addition, patients with a recent anaphylactic drug reaction, even if allergy testing and challenge are negative, should be retreated only under medical surveillance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIONS FOR FUTURE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three options for future treatment in patients with a confirmed drug allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of an unrelated medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful administration of a related medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization to the culprit drug</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration of an unrelated medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most straightforward option is administration of an unrelated medication that is safe and effective for the disorder in question. However, second-line therapies may confer their own risks, such as toxicities and higher costs.</p><p>Penicillin allergy illustrates the issues involved. Patients labeled penicillin allergic often receive non-beta-lactam antibiotics, which can be more expensive, associated with side effects, and in some cases, less efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/82-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-85</a>]. Specifically, patients carrying the diagnosis of penicillin allergy are more likely to be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or quinolones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/82,86-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,86-90</a>]. The use of these broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to the development and spread of drug-resistant bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>]. One study assessed various risk factors for the development of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Among pre-MICU treatment with various classes of antibiotics, quinolones had the strongest association with subsequent development of VRE (odds ratio = 8.6), whereas treatment with <span class=\"nowrap\">penicillins/beta-lactamase</span> inhibitors was not associated with developing VRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Some broad-spectrum antibiotics are also associated with Clostridium difficile infection. Thus, use of alternative, unrelated medications is not without risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration of a related medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second alternative for drug-allergic patients is to receive a medication similar, but not identical to the offending drug.</p><p>The likelihood of cross-reactivity among similar drugs is partly dependent on the type of allergic reaction in question. As an example, a patient with a T cell-mediated exanthema to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> is at low risk for reacting to a cephalosporin, whereas a patient with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated anaphylaxis to amoxicillin is at some increased risk if given a cephalosporin. The related medication may be one for which skin testing is informative, or it can be initially given via graded challenge. Cross-reactivity within classes of medications is discussed in specific topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-evaluation-for-immediate-penicillin-allergy-skin-test-based-diagnostic-strategies-and-cross-reactivity-with-other-beta-lactam-antibiotics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy evaluation for immediate penicillin allergy: Skin test-based diagnostic strategies and cross-reactivity with other beta-lactam antibiotics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infusion reactions to systemic chemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Desensitization to the culprit drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The third option is desensitization to the culprit drug. Classical desensitization is predictably successful for type I, IgE-mediated allergy, although gradual dose escalation may be attempted with variable success to several other types of immunologic and nonimmunologic drug reactions. Drug desensitization is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS PRONE TO DRUG ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a drug allergy has been identified, the affected patient should be educated about avoidance and provided with a written list of the generic and brand names of the culprit drug, as well as possibly cross-reactive drugs. Patients with potentially severe reactions should carry wallet cards, wear identification jewelry, or register with a drug allergy information service.</p><p>As discussed previously, some individuals are vulnerable to allergic drug reactions as a result of genetic or metabolic abnormalities (eg, multiple drug allergy syndrome), frequent and recurrent drug exposure (eg, antibiotics in cystic fibrosis), or certain disease states related to immune dysfunction (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). In a drug allergy-prone population, pharmacotherapy requires special management to avoid adverse events and to prevent (to the degree possible) sensitization or resensitization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h2\">Limit antibiotic use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efforts should be made to limit unnecessary exposure to antibiotics. These include the diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose to infections. As examples, rhinitis and asthma should be aggressively treated with glucocorticoid nasal sprays and inhalers to minimize sinopulmonary infections, and diabetes mellitus should be tightly controlled. Less commonly, undiagnosed immunodeficiency is present.</p><p>Age-appropriate vaccinations should be administered and repeated at the recommended intervals. Avoidance of unnecessary exposures to contagious diseases may be helpful, especially in children and patients with immunodeficiency.</p><p>Proactive efforts to obtain culture data before initiating antibiotics can help to limit cumulative antibiotic exposure by avoiding treatment of viral infections, and minimizing mid-treatment changes in antibiotic regimens. Enlisting the cooperation of the patient's other providers is important.</p><p>Consideration should be given to treating through mild cutaneous reactions, such as itching or mild rashes, especially early in therapy when an alternative antibiotic will usually be required. Treating through is possible in delayed-onset exanthema. This is typically considered when alternative treatments are problematic, and an allergy specialist considers continued exposure to the drug to be low risk. Ongoing vigilance for clinical and laboratory danger signs is necessary, and concomitant use of glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 0.5 mg per kg) may be required if the exanthem intensifies rather than improves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to initiating new drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In drug allergy prone patients, new drugs should be started at lower than normal doses when feasible. Administration under medical observation is sometimes necessary.</p><p>Patients with past Stevens-Johnson <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/toxic</span> epidermal necrolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">(SJS/TEN)</span> and drug-induced hypersensitivity <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/drug</span> reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">(DRESS/DiHS)</span> should be taught about the earliest symptoms of these reactions, such as fever or mucosal irritation, and know to stop medications immediately should these appear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H57293595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Prodrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress#H873157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with prior <span class=\"nowrap\">DRESS/DiHS</span> experience a period of drug intolerance during the weeks after the initial reaction, meaning that any new drug may exacerbate symptoms (exanthems, hepatitis), often without proof of a new sensitization. The symptoms may lead to the suspicion of a new drug allergy and further limit treatment. However, when the immune system is less activated (documented by circulating activated lymphocytes) the new drugs are again tolerated. This phenomenon has been termed a &quot;flare up&quot; reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, some patients with prior <span class=\"nowrap\">DiHS/DRESS</span> do develop genuine sensitizations to new compounds, and some develop multiple drug hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>Patients with past immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to drugs should not be given premedications before gradual dose escalation of new drugs. Neither antihistamines nor glucocorticoids can prevent IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and premedications may mask early symptoms and allow dosing to proceed more rapidly than advisable.</p><p>In contrast to the above scenarios, patients who have reacted with uncomplicated exanthemas, including mild urticaria, to a variety of different drugs may benefit from administration of an antihistamine when new drugs are initiated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1897545617\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Individuals with two or more immunologic drug reactions to chemically-unrelated medications are said to have &quot;multiple drug allergy syndrome.&quot; (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for drug allergy'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of drug allergy while receiving multiple medications simultaneously are best approached in a systematic manner. Evaluation involves a meticulous history of past and present drug reactions, additional information gathering from the medical record, and analysis of temporal patterns between drug administration and onset of symptoms. Once this information has been assembled, it is combined with knowledge about the types of allergic reactions most often caused by various classes of drugs, to identify potential culprit agents. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Systematic approach to the patient'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Review the medical record'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, objective testing for the diagnosis of drug allergy is limited. Skin testing is helpful for some medications that cause type I, immediate hypersensitivity reactions, although skin testing has been fully validated only for penicillin.
