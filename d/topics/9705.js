Interferon alfa was the first treatment approved in most countries. It leads to a beneficial response in 30 to 40 percent of patients, but is expensive, and may be accompanied by unpleasant side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lamivudine</a> (Epivir-HBV) was originally developed for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>). It was subsequently found to be effective in inhibiting HBV replication, and was the first oral antiviral therapy approved for treatment of hepatitis B.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lamivudine</a> (3TC) is the (-) enantiomer of 2', 3'-dideoxy 3'-thiacytidine. It is phosphorylated to the triphosphate (3TC-TP) which competes with dCTP for incorporation into growing DNA chains, causing chain termination. This may occur during reverse transcription of the first strand of HBV DNA, and during synthesis of the second strand of HBV DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lamivudine may also reverse the T cell hyporesponsiveness to hepatitis B viral antigens observed in patients who have chronic HBV infection, although this effect appears to be transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Lamivudine monotherapy is effective in suppressing HBV replication and in ameliorating liver disease in patients with HBeAg-positive as well as in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the treatment of chronic hepatitis B with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>.

A problem with longer duration of therapy is the selection of lamivudine-resistant mutants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Asian patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> in Asian patients was illustrated in a study that included 358 Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lamivudine (25 or 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The respective responses at the end of the one-year treatment period in these three groups were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HBeAg seroconversion in 4, 13, and 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normalization of serum ALT in 24, 65, and 72 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvement in the histologic necroinflammatory score by &ge;2 in 25, 49, and 56 percent</p><p/><p>Follow-up reports of 58 patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> continuously for five years showed that the rate of HBeAg seroconversion at one, two, three, four, and five years were 17, 27, 33, 47, and 50 percent, respectively, indicating that HBeAg seroconversion rate increased with longer duration of treatment. However, the proportion of patients with lamivudine-resistant mutants also increased from 14 percent in year one to 38, 49, 66 and 69 percent after two, three, four, and five years of treatment, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lamivudine</a> is also effective in patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B (most of the patients presumably have precore or core promoter HBV variants) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of the hepatitis B virus and pathogenesis of infection&quot;</a>). HBV DNA loss and ALT normalization were observed in 65 to 96 percent of patients by one year in several series, although relapse occurred in 48 to 90 percent of responding patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Histologic improvement was seen in approximately 60 percent of patients after 12 months of therapy.</p><p>Breakthrough infections were usually associated with the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants. Breakthrough infections were associated with flares of hepatitis in some patients, and hepatic decompensation in a few patients. Extending the duration of treatment resulted in progressively lower rates of response due to the selection of lamivudine-resistant mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one study of 78 patients, virologic remission (undetectable HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assay) decreased from 77 percent at 12 months to 52 percent at 24 months, and 42 percent at 36 months; the corresponding rates of biochemical remission were 90, 63, and 53 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A retrospective multicenter study evaluated clinical outcomes in relation to the virologic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A virologic response was defined as a negative test result in the hybrid capture or the branched DNA assay <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an HBV DNA level of less than 10(5) <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. The study included a total of 656 patients who had received therapy for a median of 22 months (range 1 to 66 months). A virologic response was observed in 616 patients (95 percent) but was maintained in only 39 percent of patients after four years. In patients with cirrhosis, those who maintained a virologic response were significantly less likely than those with viral breakthrough to develop worsening disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. Survival was significantly better in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis at baseline who maintained a virologic response. Similar observations were described in another report of 651 patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>These data suggest that there are substantial clinical benefits in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV who maintain a virologic response.

It should be emphasized that the second biopsy was performed during treatment in the lamivudine group and 28 weeks after stopping treatment in the other two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> in children with chronic hepatitis B is limited. Available data indicate that lamivudine is safe and effective in children but the benefit must be carefully balanced against the risk of selecting resistant mutants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT ON LIVER HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, one-year treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> is associated with histologic improvement in more than 50 percent of patients. As expected, the observed improvement after a short course of lamivudine was predominantly a reduction in necroinflammation. Longer duration of treatment also appears to reduce fibrosis.</p><p>This was illustrated in a study of 63 patients who had three liver biopsies at baseline, at the end of one year of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> treatment as part of a controlled trial, and after two additional years of open label treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At the end of one year, 36 patients (57 percent) showed a &ge;2 point improvement in the Histologic Activity Index. After two additional years of treatment, 60 percent remained stable while 19 percent continued to improve. Compared to baseline, 77 percent of patients with no lamivudine-resistant mutations showed improvement, 18 percent had no change, and 5 percent had worsening of necroinflammatory activity after three years of lamivudine treatment, while the corresponding values for patients with lamivudine resistant mutations were 45, 41, and 14 percent, respectively. Fibrosis improved in 12 of 19 patients (63 percent) while cirrhosis improved in 8 of 11 patients (73 percent). These data support the beneficial effect of three-year lamivudine treatment on liver histology, but the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutations blunted the histologic response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DURABILITY OF RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial data suggested that patients who achieve HBeAg seroconversion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> treatment are likely to have a durable response. Follow-up of patients enrolled in various clinical trials in the United States and Europe reported that 30 of 39 (77 percent) patients with HBeAg seroconversion had durable response after a median follow-up of 37 months (range 5 to 46 months). In addition, 8 (20 percent) patients developed HBsAg seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The estimated durability of lamivudine-induced HBeAg seroconversion was lower, 64 percent at 36 months, if patients who relapsed prior to entry into the long-term follow-up were included.</p><p>Three studies from Asia reported lower rates of durable response, 38 to 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The duration of treatment after HBeAg seroconversion appeared to be important in maintaining durable response as the median duration of treatment was shorter in patients who did not have a durable response (9 versus 20 months), an observation that has also been suggested in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another study from Taiwan found that durability of response was increased among patients infected with HBV genotype B versus C, those below the age of &le;36 years, and those who had &gt;eight months additional treatment after HBeAg seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The durability of response with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> may be less than for interferon. This issue was addressed in an analysis of individual patient data that included a total of 130 patients from 24 centers who achieved HBeAg seroconversion following treatment with lamivudine (n = 59), interferon (n = 49), or combination therapy with interferon plus lamivudine (n = 22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The three-year cumulative rate of HBeAg relapse was significantly higher with lamivudine monotherapy compared with interferon alone or combination therapy (54 versus 32 and 23 percent, respectively). However, there were significant baseline differences among the three treatment groups and it is unclear if consecutive patients with treatment response in those 24 centers were included in the analysis.</p><p>The durability of response in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (defined as normal alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and undetectable serum HBV DNA using non-PCR assays) who stopped treatment after one year is lower. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A problem with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> treatment is the development of drug resistance. Genotypic analysis of viral isolates from patients with virologic breakthrough while receiving lamivudine suggests that the principal mutation associated with resistance is a methionine to valine or isoleucine substitution - <span class=\"nowrap\">rtM204V/I</span> in the YMDD motif of the catalytic domain of HBV polymerase. Another mutation results in a leucine to methionine substitution (at position rtL180M) located upstream of the YMDD motif [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The latter mutation is always found in combination with one of the mutations in the YMDD motif and appears to be a compensatory mutation that restores replication fitness of the virus. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the <span class=\"nowrap\">rtM204V/I</span> mutations confer up to 10,000-fold resistance, suggesting that antiviral response cannot be restored by increasing the dose of lamivudine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Resistance may also be a result of a substitution of valine or threonine for alanine at position 181 <span class=\"nowrap\">(rtA181V/T)</span>.</p><p>Resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> due to the <span class=\"nowrap\">rtM204V/I</span> mutants was detected in 81 of 335 patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (24 percent) treated in the clinical trials mentioned above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,26,27</a>]. The incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">rtM204V/I</span> mutations increased with longer duration of therapy (10 percent at 24 weeks, 24 percent at 52 weeks, and up to 65 percent by five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The development of resistance should be suspected in patients who have a breakthrough infection, defined as &gt;1 log or 10-fold increase in serum HBV DNA from nadir. Breakthrough infection can also occur due to non-compliance. Breakthrough due to non-compliance is associated with reappearance of wild type HBV, and has been shown to respond to reinstitution of therapy.</p><p>Several studies showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a> dipivoxil, a nucleotide analogue, is effective in inhibiting lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants, but adefovir has weak antiviral activity and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> should be continued if adefovir is used in this setting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-and-adefovir-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-hbv-infection#H1228184470\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection&quot;, section on 'Adefovir'</a>).&nbsp;Tenofovir, a nucleotide analogue, is also effective in such patients and is preferred to adefovir because of more potent antiviral activity and a lower rate of antiviral drug resistance. Switching to tenofovir alone is equally efficacious compared with adding lamivudine or switching to a combination of tenofovir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-and-adefovir-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-hbv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistant mutants have also been reported in 57 to 64 percent of patients treated for HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B for more than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7-11,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11,29,30</a>]. One study included 44 consecutive patients with cirrhosis who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> 100 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. After five years, 21 (48 percent) maintained undetectable serum HBV DNA levels (by non PCR methods) and a normal ALT while 22 (52 percent) developed lamivudine resistance. Only 10 percent of patients had undetectable HBV DNA levels by PCR. The five-year cumulative probability for developing resistance was estimated to be 63 percent. Clinical deterioration developed in none of the responders compared with seven (32 percent) nonresponders. Overall, liver related complications occurred less frequently in responders than those with resistance (28 versus 64 percent).</p><p>In another series of 29 patients, the cumulative rate of detection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> resistant mutations after one and two years was 10 and 56 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Interestingly, three patients who developed lamivudine-resistant mutants had reversion of the precore stop codon mutation, which was associated with the reappearance of HBeAg in two of the patients. Reversion from stop codon to wild type sequence in the precore region in association with the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants was also reported in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Virologic breakthrough appears ultimately to lead to a biochemical relapse.

The only two independent predictors of response identified on multivariate analysis were elevated baseline ALT levels and a higher Histologic Activity Score. The rates of HBeAg seroconversion (ie, loss of detectable levels of HBeAg and HBV DNA in serum and the appearance of antibody to HBeAg) for patients with pretreatment ALT levels within normal, one to two times normal, two to five times normal, and more than five times normal were 2, 7, 20, and 42 percent, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57652\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57652 \">table 1</a>). The corresponding figures for 196 patients in the placebo group were 0, 5, 9, and 15 percent, respectively. These variables were predictive of lamivudine response in both Asian and Caucasian patients.</p><p>At least one report found that HBV DNA levels during the first 4 to 24 weeks of therapy predicted response with long-term treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The study included 74 HBeAg positive patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> for up to five years.

A reduction of HBV DNA levels of 4 and 3.6 log <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (2000 and 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL)</span> at weeks 4 and 16, respectively, predicted an ideal response. Patients with HBV DNA levels above these cutoffs had an 84 and 88 percent chance, respectively, of <strong>not</strong> achieving an ideal response at five years. The authors concluded that measurement of HBV DNA levels at week 4 should be performed and alternative treatments should be considered in those with a decrease in HBV DNA of less than a 4 log <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL)</span>. However, these data were based on post hoc analysis of data from a very small number of patients.

Potentially serious, but uncommon, adverse effects include pancreatitis and lactic acidosis while on therapy.

One of the largest studies with the longest follow-up included 998 patients with HBeAg positive compensated chronic HBV who received lamivudine for up to six years (median four years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As discussed above, hepatitis flares occurred in 10 percent of patients in year one, and in 18 to 21 percent of patients in years two to five. There were ten episodes of hepatic decompensation in eight patients (1 percent). Fifty-three patients (5 percent) experienced a total of 60 liver-disease related serious adverse events including two deaths. The authors concluded that lamivudine treatment for up to six years has an excellent safety profile in patients with HBeAg-positive compensated liver disease but that patients with longstanding lamivudine-resistant mutations may experience worsening of liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION AND ENDPOINTS OF THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">HBeAg-positive patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, the endpoint of treatment is HBeAg seroconversion. It is reasonable to check HBV DNA levels every three months to monitor for antiviral response and breakthrough infection, and to check HBeAg and anti-HBe at 12 months and every three to six months thereafter to assess for HBeAg seroconversion.</p><p>Relapse rates upon discontinuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> after HBeAg seroconversion have been reported to be more than 50 percent; however, some studies included a small number of patients and some included no or limited duration of consolidation therapy (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Durability of response'</a> above). Several patient and treatment-related factors have been associated with the likelihood of a durable response as described above. Limited data suggest that extending treatment for at least 12 months after HBeAg seroconversion may increase the durability of the response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/20,22,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,50</a>]. A study of 178 patients who discontinued lamivudine after achieving HBeAg loss and undetectable serum HBV DNA found that the rate of relapse (defined as redetection of HBV DNA in serum) increased from 16 percent at one year to 30 percent at five years. Age &le;40 years and additional treatment for more than 12 months after HBeAg loss or seroconversion were independent factors for sustained virologic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In this study, the five-year cumulative rate of virologic relapse was 9 percent in patients who continued treatment for at least 12 months after HBeAg seroconversion compared with 62 percent in patients who had no or a shorter duration of consolidation therapy.</p><p>Some authorities have advocated continuing therapy indefinitely; one study found that compared with those in whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> was stopped, continuing lamivudine after HBeAg seroconversion was associated with a higher proportion of patients continuing to have undetectable HBV DNA, a reduced number of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares, and low rates of resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Given the high rate of resistance associated with prolonged lamivudine treatment, switching to <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogs with a higher genetic barrier to resistance (lower risk of drug resistance) might be considered if treatment is to be continued indefinitely.</p><p>Based upon the available data, discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> can be considered in patients who have confirmed HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive on two occasions with undetectable HBV DNA) and at least 12 additional months of therapy after HBeAg seroconversion has been confirmed on repeat testing. Patients who stopped treatment must be closely monitored for relapse so treatment can be reinstituted if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>In patients who have not achieved HBeAg seroconversion after one year of therapy, treatment may be continued with the hope that it will result in HBeAg seroconversion in subsequent years, but these patients should be switched to <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogs with a higher genetic barrier to resistance.

Extending lamivudine treatment beyond one year is associated with a diminishing rate of sustained biochemical and virological response due to selection of resistant mutants.

This was illustrated in a study that evaluated 191 patients with chronic HBeAg-negative HBV who achieved sustained virologic suppression for at least five years while receiving continuous lamivudine monotherapy, and were then followed on lamivudine for a median of 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The virologic response was maintained in 67 percent, while HBsAg clearance was observed in 12 percent. Virologic breakthrough occurred in one-third of patients due to the development of lamivudine-resistant mutations. Thus, a switch to tenofovir is preferred in patients who need continued treatment.

Lamivudine-resistant mutations developed in 49 percent of patients receiving lamivudine. Such patients were more likely to experience an increase in the Child-Pugh score compared with those in whom a mutation did not develop (7 versus &lt;1 percent), the presence of resistant mutations did not negate the overall benefit of lamivudine but the duration of follow-up was short.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have generally shown that lamivudine treatment is associated with improvement in liver function and clinical status in 60 to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/54-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-63</a>].
