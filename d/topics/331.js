No single change in the management of ARDS can explain the decrease in mortality, which is likely due to multiple factors (improved approaches to mechanical ventilation and supportive care) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The Berlin Definition of ARDS (published in 2012) has replaced the American-European Consensus Conference&rsquo;s definition of ARDS (published in 1994) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

More commonly, such patients succumb to their primary illness or to secondary complications such as sepsis or multiorgan system failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with ARDS require meticulous supportive care, including intelligent use of sedatives and neuromuscular blockade, hemodynamic management, nutritional support, control of blood glucose levels, expeditious evaluation and treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, and prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill patients, including patients with ARDS, is discussed in detail separately.

This was illustrated by a study of seven critically ill patients, which found that the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> reduced resting and total energy expenditure by 6 and 8.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Patients with severe ARDS may require sedation for several days or longer. As is true for non-ARDS patients requiring sedation and analgesia, choice of agent should be driven by the patient&rsquo;s specific needs. For example, narcotics may be used for pain and suppression of the respiratory drive; benzodiazepines may be used for anxiety; and antipsychotic agents may be helpful for agitated delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Increasing evidence suggests that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> may be a useful alternative, particularly when compared to infusions of benzodiazepines, the details of which are discussed separately.

Strategies such as routinely waking patients each day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], using intermittent instead of continuous infusions of sedatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], following a sedation and analgesia protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/17,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,21</a>], and avoiding sedation altogether if tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], may lead to important benefits such as decreased time on the ventilator and fewer nosocomial infections. The avoidance of excessive sedation is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Avoid excess sedation'</a>.)</p><p>Using sedation scales such as the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) may help clinicians meet sedation goals more effectively, decreasing the likelihood of over or under-sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>]. Most patients should be able to tolerate being kept comfortably awake or lightly sedated (eg, RASS of 0 or negative 1) although some patients with more severe lung injury or poor tolerance of mechanical ventilation may need deeper sedation. Two studies found no evidence that increased sedation is required when patients are managed with low tidal volume as opposed to more traditional higher tidal volume ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>There is evidence that using no pharmacological sedation may be superior to using a continuous sedative infusion with daily interruption. In a single center study that enrolled patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours (including patients with ARDS), a protocol of no sedation was compared to the use of a continuous sedative infusion with daily interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients managed without sedation received intensive non-pharmacological support, such as verbal comforting and reassurance. The no sedation group spent more time off the ventilator and less time in the ICU than those managed with continuous sedative infusions that were interrupted daily. Similar studies in patients with ARDS need to be performed to determine whether a strategy of no sedation is a viable approach in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is widely recognized that neuromuscular blockade can have desirable effects (improves oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]) and undesirable effects (prolonged neuromuscular weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]) in patients with ARDS, the impact of these competing effects on patient-important outcomes has remained unclear. This uncertainty was addressed by a multicenter trial that randomly assigned 340 patients with ARDS to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisatracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisatracurium</a> besylate or placebo by continuous infusion for 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At the time of enrollment, all of the patients had been mechanically ventilated using low tidal volume ventilation and had a PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> ratio of &lt;150 mmHg on a PEEP of &ge;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for less than 48 hours. Both groups were deeply sedated to a Ramsay sedation score of 6 (no response to glabellar tap). Patients treated with cisatracurium besylate had non-statistically significant lower crude 90-day, 28-day, hospital, and ICU mortality rates compared to the placebo group. Following a pre-specified statistical plan, the authors adjusted for baseline differences in the PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>,</span> SAPS II severity score, and plateau airway pressure, and found a statistically significant decrease in 90-day mortality in patients treated with cisatracurium besylate (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.98). The beneficial effects on 90-day mortality were limited to patients who presented with a PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> ratio of less than 120 mm Hg. Patients treated with cisatracurium besylate also had significantly more ventilator-free days during the first 28 and 90 days (defined as the number of days since successful weaning from mechanical ventilation) and were significantly less likely to experience barotrauma. There was no difference in the frequency of ICU-acquired neuromuscular weakness.</p><p>We believe that these findings need to be replicated before neuromuscular blockade becomes part of the routine management of patients with early, severe ARDS. Until then, the body of evidence suggests that the administration of short-term (up to 48 hours) neuromuscular blockade to patients with ARDS who have severe gas exchange abnormalities (eg, PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> &le;120 mmHg) is probably safe and potentially beneficial. The neuromuscular blocking agents are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodynamic management guided by a central venous catheter (CVC) has been compared to that guided by a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) in patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the trial, 1000 patients with ARDS were randomly assigned to receive a CVC or a PAC. There was no difference in mortality, lung function, ventilator-free days, organ failure free days, or ICU-free days at day 28. Rates of hypotension, dialysis, and vasopressor use were also the same in both groups. But, the PAC group had an approximately two-fold increase of catheter-related complications, predominantly arrhythmias. This suggests that the PAC should not be used routinely in patients with ARDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to nutritional support in patients with ARDS is uncertain and more high quality evidence is needed to identify the best approach to optimizing patient outcomes. Patients with ARDS are intensely catabolic and nutritional support may help to offset catabolic losses and modulate the metabolic response to stress, mitigate oxidative cellular injury, and promote beneficial immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If the gastrointestinal tract is available for nutritional intake, enteral feedings are preferred. Possible advantages of the enteral route include fewer intravascular infections, less GI bleeding because of gastric buffering, and preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, which in turn may decrease bacterial translocation across the gut. Overfeeding offers no nutritional advantage and should be avoided to prevent excessive carbon dioxide production. When patients are fed, it is essential that they be kept semirecumbent with their heads in the upright position to decrease the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several large randomized studies have also shown that although initial low volume (&ldquo;trophic feeding&rdquo;) enteral feeding does not alter the rate of ventilator-free days or mortality, it is associated with fewer side effects. Thus we prefer low-volume initial enteral feeding in patients with ARDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Amount and rate'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucose control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to glucose control in patients with ARDS is extrapolated from trials that enrolled patients with critical illness, including ARDS. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nosocomial pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nosocomial pneumonia is an important complication among patients with ARDS and can contribute to increased morbidity, including prolonged mechanical ventilation. As an example, one prospective study of 30 patients with severe ARDS found that nosocomial pneumonia developed in 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The first episode occurred at an average of 10 days after the onset of ARDS. Nosocomial pneumonia increases morbidity in ARDS, although the impact on mortality is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Given the baseline radiographic abnormalities and frequent colonization by potential pathogens, it is difficult to diagnose pneumonia in patients with ARDS on the basis of clinical factors alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].The misdiagnosis of pneumonia in patients with ARDS may have unfortunate consequences. Inappropriate treatment of patients without pneumonia promotes the emergence of organisms with antibiotic resistance, while a missed diagnosis may be lethal.</p><p>Good clinical practice includes following standard guidelines recommended for the general population of mechanically ventilated patients to help prevent, diagnose, and treat ventilator associated pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

These patients often have multiple risk factors for venous thrombosis, including prolonged immobility, trauma, activation of the coagulation pathway, and predisposing illnesses, such as sepsis, obesity, and malignancy. Thus, all patients admitted to intensive care units require some form of thromboprophylaxis, the details of which are discussed separately.

However, their administration to patients with ARDS from other causes is controversial. Data from randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that glucocorticoids are <strong>not</strong> beneficial and may be harmful when administered later in the course of ARDS (ie, &ge;14 days). A conditional recommendation issued by the Society of Critical Care <span class=\"nowrap\">Medicine/European</span> Society of ICU Medicine <span class=\"nowrap\">(SCCM/EISCM)</span> states that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> may be administered to those with early (ie, &lt;14 days) moderate-severe ARDS (ie, partial arterial pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">oxygen/fraction</span> of inspired oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>]</span> ratio &lt;200) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, based upon the same data, we are not proponents of the routine administration of glucocorticoids early in the course of ARDS until an appropriately-powered, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrates clear benefit in this population. Our rationale for the avoidance of glucocorticoids in early ARDS is based upon a mortality benefit that is not robustly proven and the potential for adverse effects as well as a lack of clarification regarding ideal population in terms of disease severity and glucocorticoid timing, duration, and dosing. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conflicting data on mortality</strong> &ndash; The uncertain effect of glucocorticoids on mortality is exemplified by five meta-analyses that compared systemic glucocorticoid therapy to placebo in patients with ARDS. Most meta-analyses found that glucocorticoid therapy improves gas exchange, decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation, and decreased length of stay in the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. However, data on mortality are inconsistent; three meta-analyses reported a reduction in mortality that was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>], while two subsequent meta-analyses found that glucocorticoid therapy reduced mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. As an example, one of these meta-analyses that used individual data from four randomized controlled trials reported a mortality benefit from the early administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (20 versus 39 percent, odds ratio; 0.39; 95% CI 0.22-0.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and suggested that prolonged treatment courses may be driving this benefit (treatment was up to 28 days). However, the analysis is flawed using data from mixed populations of ARDS severity and different doses for prolonged periods of time. While encouraging, we believe that these data need to be replicated in a trial that includes only patients with moderate to severe ARDS who are randomized to receive glucocorticoids early in the course of the disease for a set period of time before recommendations can be made to subject patients with ARDS to prolonged courses of steroids. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The effect of timing</strong> &ndash; Data suggest that if there is any potential benefit from glucocorticoids, it may occur during the first 14 days following diagnosis, while administration after 14 days may be harmful: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Late (&ge;14 days)</strong> &ndash; Several studies have evaluated the impact of systemic glucocorticoids during persistent ARDS, also known as the fibroproliferative phase or late ARDS. The most notable was a double-blind trial by the ARDS Network that randomly assigned 180 patients with persistent ARDS (defined as ongoing disease 7 to 28 days after its onset) to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or placebo for 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Overall, there was no difference in 60-day or 180-day mortality. However, subgroup analysis suggested that among patients randomized more than 14 days after the onset of ARDS, methylprednisolone increased 60-day mortality (35 versus 8 percent) and 180-day mortality (44 versus 12 percent). In contrast, patients randomized 7 to 13 days after the onset of ARDS, methylprednisolone caused a non-statistically significant reduction in 60-day mortality (27 versus 36 percent) and 180-day mortality (27 versus 39 percent).

Important features of this trial included vigilant surveillance for infection and avoidance of neuromuscular blockade. Glucocorticoid therapy reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and ICU mortality (21 versus 43 percent).

Unfortunately, each modality is associated with an element of unquantifiable risk. As a result, the clinician must ultimately choose a strategy that provides adequate oxygenation (PaO<sub>2</sub> &ge;55 to 80 mmHg) while minimizing the inevitable risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplemental oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients require a high FiO<sub>2</sub>, especially early in ARDS when pulmonary edema is most severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Although high flow oxygen can be provided through a face mask or nasal cannulae, it is difficult to provide more than approximately 70 percent noninvasively because environmental air is entrained. By comparison, up to 100 percent oxygen is delivered easily when administered through an endotracheal tube.</p><p>Almost all patients therefore require intubation and mechanical ventilation. During the peri-intubation period, 95 to 100 percent oxygen should be given to ensure an adequate SaO<sub>2</sub>. Because oxygen uptake may exceed replenishment in areas with low <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> ratios, some clinicians use slightly less than 100 percent oxygen (eg, 95 percent) in an attempt to prevent absorptive atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Once well established, absorptive atelectasis is not rapidly reversed by reduction of FiO<sub>2</sub> to maintenance levels, emphasizing the desirability of rapid downward titration of FiO<sub>2</sub> to the lowest fraction necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Although the risk of high FiO<sub>2</sub> supplementation has not been studied specifically in patients with ARDS, it is probably significant. Studies in animals and normal humans reveal that high concentrations of oxygen damage the lung within hours, in part by forming toxic oxygen species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. The specific threshold for oxygen toxicity is unknown but appears to begin above 50 percent, and the risk rises as concentrations approach 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. As a result, the FiO<sub>2</sub> should be decreased to the 50 to 60 percent range as soon as safely possible. Additional therapeutic measures such as fluid management may be needed to allow the FiO<sub>2</sub> to be decreased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen toxicity&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Ongoing studies are underway to compare conservative to liberal oxygenation targets. Pending the outcome of such studies, we recommend adhering to a goal PaO<sub>2</sub> of 55 to 80 mmHg or SaO<sub>2</sub> 88 to 95 percent as used in studies performed by the ARDSNET investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>Mechanical ventilation strategies in patients with ARDS, including those that may allow a decrease in the FiO<sub>2</sub>, are discussed in detail elsewhere.

As a result, pulmonary edema is more likely to develop in ARDS than in normals for any given pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, even in patients who are not volume overloaded, a strategy of conservative fluid management may help patients by reducing edema formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/8,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,56-58</a>]. This was best illustrated by a trial in which 1000 patients with established ARDS were randomly assigned to either a conservative or a liberal strategy of fluid management for seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients assigned to the conservative group were managed with a fluid strategy that targeted a CVP &lt;4 mmHg or a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) &lt;8 mmHg. Patients managed with the liberal strategy targeted a CVP of 10 to 14 mmHg or a PAOP of 14 to 18 mmHg. The mean cumulative fluid balance was -136 mL in the conservative strategy group and +6992 mL in the liberal strategy group. The conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index and lung injury score, while increasing ventilator-free days (15 versus 12 days) and ICU-free days (13 versus 11 days). The 60 day mortality rate was unaltered by the fluid management strategy. Despite clearly identified CVP and PAOP goals, mean CVP and PAOP remained well above the target goals in the conservative management group, suggesting that a CVP &lt;4 mmHg or a PAOP &lt;8 mmHg is difficult to achieve safely with the strategies outlined in this population. A clear benefit of conservative fluid management on mortality has not yet been shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Of note, one study of a subset of participants in the fluid management trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] suggested a possible association between conservative fluid management and cognitive impairment in ARDS survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Further studies are warranted to explore the relationship between fluid management and long term outcomes. </p><p>Nonetheless, given the potential benefits of conservative fluid management on ventilator and ICU-free days, we prefer a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with ARDS, as long as hypotension and organ hypoperfusion can be avoided. It is reasonable to target a central venous pressure of &lt;4 mmHg or a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure &lt;8 mmHg; however, it should be recognized that such goals may be difficult to achieve.

We suggest NOT administering systemic glucocorticoids to patients 14 days or longer after the onset of ARDS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This approach is based upon data that suggest systemic glucocorticoids administered two weeks or later after the onset of ARDS is not beneficial and may be harmful, when compared with those who receive glucocorticoids within the first 14 days. We also suggest not routinely administering glucocorticoids to those with early ARDS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), since the data do not support a clear consistent benefit in this population. However, they can be administered on a case-by-case basis. Our rationale for is based upon a mortality benefit that is not robustly proven and the potential for adverse effects as well as a lack of clarification regarding ideal population in terms of disease severity and glucocorticoid timing, duration, and dosing.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nosocomial pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data suggest that a conservative fluid management strategy that aims to minimize or eliminate positive fluid balance &mdash; for example, by aiming for a CVP &lt;4 mmHg or a PAOP &lt;8 mmHg &mdash; offers clinical advantages, including improved oxygenation, increased ventilator-free days, and ICU-free days. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While blood transfusion and inotropes may augment oxygen delivery, most data caution against indiscriminate use of these strategies. For most patients, packed red blood cells can be withheld until the hemoglobin concentration drops below 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> unless there are alternative reasons for transfusion. Similarly, there is no evidence that inotropes benefit ARDS patients with a normal cardiac function.
