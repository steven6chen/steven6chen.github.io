Although water excretion is impaired, sodium handling is intact since there is no abnormality in volume-regulating mechanisms such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or atrial natriuretic peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment of hyponatremia due to SIADH (including the reset osmostat variant) will be reviewed here. The choice of therapy of SIADH is dependent upon a number of factors including the degree of hyponatremia, the presence or absence of symptoms, and, to some degree, the urine osmolality.</p><p>The pathogenesis and etiology of the SIADH and a general review of the treatment of hyponatremia due to a variety of causes are discussed separately.

Among patients with SIADH, the combination of water retention and secondary solute (sodium plus potassium) loss accounts for essentially all of the reduction in serum sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>These changes occur in the following sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia is initially mediated by ADH-induced water retention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ensuing volume expansion activates secondary natriuretic mechanisms, resulting in sodium and water loss and the restoration of near-euvolemia. The net effect is that, with chronic SIADH, sodium loss is more prominent than water retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, since there is no impairment in volume regulatory hormones (aldosterone and natriuretic peptides), patients with SIADH are <strong>euvolemic</strong> unless there is a second problem leading to salt loss (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, or diuretic therapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia may also be associated with potassium loss. Since potassium is as osmotically active as sodium, the loss of potassium contributes to the reductions in plasma osmolality and sodium concentration.

Cells that increase in size due to water entry in hyponatremia lose potassium and other solutes in an attempt to restore cell volume. This adaptation is discussed elsewhere.

The associated negative water balance initially raises the serum sodium concentration slowly toward normal and, with maintenance therapy in chronic SIADH, prevents a further reduction in serum sodium.

Patients with SAH are at risk for cerebral vasospasm and infarction, the incidence of which is increased by a fall in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Because of the neurologic symptoms associated with the cerebral bleeding, it is typically difficult to determine the role, if any, of the hyponatremia in the pathogenesis of the symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyponatremia in patients with SAH is usually due to SIADH, but is often inappropriately characterized as cerebral salt wasting (CSW), a much less common problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The two disorders have similar manifestations, and it is only the presence of clear evidence of volume depletion (eg, hypotension, decreased skin turgor, possibly increased blood <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urea-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">urea</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">nitrogen/serum</span> creatinine ratio) despite a urine sodium concentration that is not low that suggests that CSW might be present rather than SIADH.

If the serum sodium concentration is to be elevated, the electrolyte concentration of the fluid given must <strong>exceed the electrolyte concentration of the urine</strong>, not simply that of the plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The calculations that follow are similar to those that are described in greater detail elsewhere.

When ADH release does not respond to changes in water intake, as usually occurs in SIADH, the urine osmolality is relatively fixed and the urine volume varies with changes in solute excretion. Increasing solute excretion by giving salt or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urea-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">urea</a> will increase the urine volume and tend to raise the serum sodium.</p><p/><p>Suppose a patient with SIADH and a serum sodium of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> has a high, relatively fixed urine osmolality and a urine cation concentration (ie, urine [Na] + urine [K]) of 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> which is twice the cation concentration of isotonic saline. If 1000 mL of isotonic saline is given (containing 154 mEq of sodium), all of the NaCl will be excreted (because sodium handling is intact), but in only 500 mL of water (154 mEq of urinary sodium in 500 mL equals 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. The retention of one-half of the administered water will lead, ultimately, to a further reduction in the serum sodium concentration even though the serum sodium concentration will temporarily increase because the isotonic saline is hypertonic compared with the patient's serum before infusion of the saline.</p><p>This hypothetical example has been confirmed in postoperative patients, many of whom have transient SIADH. In one report, for example, the administration of isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's solution to 22 women who had undergone uncomplicated gynecologic surgery resulted in a fall in the serum sodium concentration by a mean of 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in 21 of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During the first 16 hours after the induction of anesthesia, the mean peak urine osmolality was more than 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> and the mean urinary sodium plus potassium concentration was almost 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (twice that in plasma). The loss of sodium plus potassium in the urine at a much higher concentration than in the plasma was responsible for the fall in serum sodium.</p><p>The response is different if hypertonic saline is given. Each liter of 3 percent saline contains 513 mEq of sodium. If 500 mL of this solution (which contains 257 mEq of sodium) is slowly given to a 60 kg woman with a total body water of approximately 30 liters and a baseline serum sodium of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> the infused sodium will increase total body sodium plus potassium from 3600 mEq to 3857 mEq, and the infused volume will increase total body water from 30 L to 30.5 L, raising the serum sodium by 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The rise in serum sodium after 500 mL of hypertonic saline will be smaller in a 70 kg man who has a larger total body water of approximately 42 liters. In this setting, the extra 257 mEq of sodium will distribute over 42.5 liters, raising the serum sodium by 4.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>However, the rise in serum sodium in response to 3 percent saline will partially dissipate over time, because all of the sodium chloride will be excreted (as with isotonic saline), but in a larger volume of urine; as an example, at a urine cation concentration (urine [Na] + urine [K]) of 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> the 257 mEq of sodium that was administered in 500 mL of 3 percent saline will be excreted in approximately 830 mL of urine; leading to net loss of 330 mL of water. The net effect is that sodium balance is unchanged but 330 mL of fluid has been lost, which will result in final elevation in the serum sodium of only 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 60 kg woman (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline x <span class=\"nowrap\">[30/29</span>.67] = 121.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 70 kg man (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline x <span class=\"nowrap\">[42/41</span>.67] = 121 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>.</p><p>Thus, after the administration of hypertonic saline in a hyponatremic patient with a high urine osmolality, there will be an initial large rise in the serum sodium concentration that falls over time as the administered sodium is excreted.</p><p>The late reduction in serum sodium is less pronounced (ie, there is a greater persistent elevation in serum sodium) if the urine osmolality and urine sodium plus potassium concentrations are not so high, since more water will follow the excretion of sodium chloride. If, for example, the urine osmolality is close to that of plasma, and the urine cation concentration is 154 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> rather than 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> the 257 mEq of sodium that was administered in 500 mL of 3 percent saline will be excreted in 1688 mL of urine. Thus, the net fluid loss will be 1188 mL (1688 minus 500 mL given), resulting in a final elevation in serum sodium of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 60 kg woman (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline x <span class=\"nowrap\">[30/28</span>.8] = 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 70 kg man (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline x <span class=\"nowrap\">[42/40</span>.8] = 123.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>.</p><p>These calculations illustrate the limited long-term effect of even hypertonic saline in hyponatremic patients with SIADH who have a highly concentrated urine. Thus, in addition to restricting water intake, efforts must also be made in such patients to reduce the urinary concentration (ie, lower the urine osmolality), which can be achieved with a loop diuretic or a vasopressin receptor antagonist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155108392\"><span class=\"h2\">High solute intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal individuals, the urine output is primarily determined by fluid intake, a relationship that is mediated by changes in the release of antidiuretic hormone that lead to appropriate changes in the urine osmolality. However, when the urine osmolality is fixed, as in SIADH, the urine output is determined by the intake and subsequent urinary excretion of solutes (mostly sodium salts and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urea-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">urea</a>), which has been called the renal solute load. As an example, at a fixed urine osmolality of 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in a patient with SIADH, the urine output will be 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> if urinary solute excretion in 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day</span> and 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> if urinary solute excretion is increased to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day</span> by a high-sodium, high-protein diet or with the ingestion of salt tablets <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urea. Such a high-solute diet can be combined with a loop diuretic, which interferes with concentrating ability and lowers the urine osmolality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral salt tablets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles described in the above section on intravenous saline also apply to oral salt intake. Suppose the same 60 kg woman with a serum sodium of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and total body water of approximately 30 L takes in 9 g of salt (154 mEq each of sodium and chloride) in tablet form. All 154 mEq will be excreted since sodium handling is normal, which will increase the urine output by 500 mL if the urine cation concentration (ie, urine [Na] + urine [K]) is 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and by approximately 1000 mL if the urine cation concentration is 154 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Using the calculations in the above section, this extra loss of water will tend to raise the serum sodium by 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline x <span class=\"nowrap\">[30/29</span>.5] = 122 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> if the urine cation concentration is 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> and by approximately 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline x <span class=\"nowrap\">[30/29]</span> = 124 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> if the urine cation concentration is 154 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

This can be achieved by impairing the renal responsiveness to ADH by the administration of a loop diuretic or a vasopressin receptor antagonist. A loop diuretic (eg, 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> orally twice a day) directly interferes with the countercurrent concentrating mechanism by decreasing sodium chloride reabsorption in the medullary aspect of the loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>].</p><p>A loop diuretic will be effective if the urine osmolality is more than twice the plasma osmolality, which typically means a urine osmolality above 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>.

The usual goal (the desired rate of increase) is an elevation in serum sodium of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per day, and the limit (the rate of increase that should not be exceeded) is 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L/day</span> (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Rate of correction'</a> above). If symptoms have resolved but the rise in serum sodium is substantially less than the 24-hour goal, further therapy in addition to fluid restriction may consist of a slow infusion of hypertonic saline (eg, 10 to 30 mL per hour) with careful monitoring of the serum sodium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with severe hyponatremia who are correcting too rapidly, prevention of further short-term elevation in the serum sodium or even relowering of the serum sodium may be warranted. How this can be achieved is discussed elsewhere.

In such patients, the urine osmolality can be reduced by administration of a loop diuretic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> 20 mg orally twice a day).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild-to-moderate symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less severe neurologic symptoms (eg, dizziness, gait disturbances, forgetfulness, confusion, and lethargy) can be seen in patients with a serum sodium concentration below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> that develops over more than 48 hours, in patients with a lesser degree of hyponatremia that develops over less than 48 hours, and in patients with chronic moderate hyponatremia (serum sodium 120 to 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. Some of these patients may benefit from hypertonic saline, but do not require the aggressive approach suggested in the preceding section for those with severe neurologic symptoms.</p><p>Initial hypertonic saline therapy using either a continuous infusion or a 50 to 100 mL bolus followed by a continuous infusion to raise the serum sodium by 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> may be justified in the first three to four hours in patients with distressing symptoms (eg, confusion and lethargy). In the calculations described above, 500 mL of hypertonic saline initially raised the serum sodium by 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 60 kg woman and 4.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 70 kg man. Thus, raising the serum sodium by 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in four hours would require approximately 300 mL of hypertonic saline in the woman and 400 mL in the man. These calculations are only estimates and the serum sodium should be measured at two to three hours. The total elevation in serum sodium in the first 24 hours should be no more than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous hypertonic saline'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with less severe symptoms can be treated with less aggressive therapy, such as fluid restriction, oral salt tablets, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urea-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">urea</a>.</p><p>Once the symptoms have resolved, further therapy is similar to that in patients with SIADH who have asymptomatic hyponatremia, with the caveat of avoidance of overly rapid correction.

The goal serum sodium is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic hyponatremia'</a> below.)</p><p>One or more of the above therapeutic modalities may be required. The usual sequence of maintenance therapy is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid restriction &ndash; The suggested goal fluid intake in hyponatremic patients with SIADH is less than 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An important exception is patients with a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage in whom fluid restriction can be deleterious.

Since sodium handling is normal and the urine osmolality is relatively fixed in SIADH, increasing oral salt intake will, in a dose-dependent fashion, increase the urine volume. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Oral salt tablets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urea-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">urea</a> &ndash; In patients with SIADH who can tolerate its bitter taste, administering oral urea will increase urine output; the usual dose is 15 to 30 g per day. Increasing oral urea will, in a dose-dependent fashion, increase the urine volume. In the calculations described above, the intake of 15 g of urea would be expected to increase the urine output by approximately 500 mL if the urine osmolality is 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> and by 1000 mL at a urine osmolality of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the urine osmolality &ndash; In patients with more severe SIADH (urine osmolality more than twice the plasma osmolality), the efficacy of both fluid restriction and increased salt intake will be reduced (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous hypertonic saline'</a> above). If further therapy is necessary, the next step is to increase urinary water excretion by impairing the mechanism of urinary concentration. This can be achieved by loop diuretic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> 20 mg orally twice a day). Loop diuretic therapy can produce hypokalemia and hypovolemia since the diuretic response is higher in patients with SIADH who usually have normal or near-normal renal function and are not sodium avid.
