Subsequently, it was established that a deficient-specific antibody response to <strong>polysaccharide</strong> antigens can be seen in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. It is one of the most commonly identified immune defects among patients presenting with recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe sinopulmonary infections. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific antibody deficiency may be identified as part of a host of distinct primary or secondary immunodeficiency disorders, such as common variable immunodeficiency or asplenia, or it may exist in isolation, as the only identifiable immune problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93661961\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terminology for specific antibody deficiency or polysaccharide nonresponse is not standardized, and other names appear in the literature, including &quot;impaired polysaccharide responsiveness&quot; and &quot;selective antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins.&quot; In this review, &quot;specific antibody deficiency&quot; refers to the condition in which polysaccharide nonresponse is the <strong>only</strong> identifiable abnormality. We use the descriptive term &quot;polysaccharide nonresponse&quot; to denote the immunologic defect, which may occur in a variety of disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93662076\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of specific antibody deficiency is not fully understood, and the various conditions in which it is found suggest that many different defects may result in the same problem.</p><p>Among very young children with normal immune systems, polysaccharide nonresponse is considered to be normal, although some studies have suggested that this generalization may be oversimplified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Still, this apparent limitation of the infant immune system prompted the development of conjugate vaccines, in which polysaccharide antigens are complexed to more immunogenic protein antigens. Also because of physiologic limitation, polysaccharide nonresponse cannot be diagnosed in a child younger than two years of age.</p><p>Polysaccharide responsiveness normally increases with age. It is possible that polysaccharide responsiveness does not develop equally in all individuals and that polysaccharide nonresponse in some children may simply represent delayed maturation of the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, there is also evidence that polysaccharide nonresponse can result from congenital molecular abnormalities. As an example, one study described an adult patient with a mutation in B cell tyrosine kinase, a deficiency more commonly associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, who had normal immunoglobulin concentrations but absent responses to polysaccharides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, polysaccharide nonresponses can be identified in some patients with congenital dysmorphic syndromes or chromosomal abnormalities associated with recurrent infections, such as patients with various phenotypes associated with 22q11 microdeletions who do not fulfill criteria for the DiGeorge syndrome.

In children older than two years of age referred for evaluation of recurrent infections, polysaccharide nonresponse in the setting of normal immunoglobulins was found in approximately 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Polysaccharide nonresponsiveness was identified in 8 percent (3 of 39 individuals) of adult patients with recurrent (&ge;3 episodes) community-acquired pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>With the widespread use of the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine to assess immune function, this syndrome has become the most frequently identified immunodeficiency in clinics that evaluate patients with recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe infections (approximately 20 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of patients with specific antibody deficiency overlap with those of all antibody deficiency syndromes.

However, failure to improve significantly with appropriate therapy should raise suspicion of additional diagnoses, including an underlying immune disorder, especially if the atopic symptoms are complicated by infections.

For patients who have not required multiple antibiotic treatments, it may be reasonable to complete an age-appropriate immunization schedule first and then to perform a complete immunologic evaluation only if frequent infections continue to occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57070 \">table 2</a>).

In addition to providing diagnostic information, vaccination enhances immunity to a common respiratory pathogen in patients suffering from recurrent infections, at least in those able to respond.</p><p>We recommend measuring titers to at least 14 specific serotypes, both before vaccination and at least four weeks after vaccination. Some immunologists do not measure the prevaccine titer if the patient has had no recent or prior pneumococcal vaccines. The panel should measure antibodies to all 23 serotypes in the polysaccharide vaccine or it should include at least 10 additional serotypes present only in the 23-valent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPV-23) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77758 \">table 3</a>). Panels of titers to different pneumococcal serotypes are available through several commercial laboratories. Specific laboratory standardization rules have been developed for antipneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies that include absorption of patient sera with polysaccharide C and serotype 22F. It is recommended that the same laboratory perform the pre- and postvaccination titers, because different laboratories may measure titers to different serotypes.</p><p>Pneumococcal immunization is generally well-tolerated. However, patients who have protective levels of antibodies to one or more serotypes included in the vaccine prior to immunization may have exaggerated local reactions that can last several days. These reactions may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.</p><p>Titers may be assessed in adults who have been previously vaccinated with the polysaccharide vaccine within the previous five years. Patients vaccinated more than five years ago may have waning titers, so if low titers are found, the patient can be revaccinated and titers checked again in four weeks.</p><p>Polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine may be used instead of pneumococcal vaccine in the rare patient with a contraindication to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (such as a previous life-threatening allergic reaction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, the interpretation of postvaccination meningococcal titers is difficult due to limited information about the definition of a normal response in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Unimmunized patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most normal unimmunized adults have protective antibodies to some pneumococcal serotypes tested as a result of clinical or subclinical infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the lack of preimmunization protective antibodies is not a deficiency per se, and most of these patients have a vigorous response to immunization. Responders cannot be differentiated from nonresponders without immunization and retesting after immunization.</p><p>In partially or unimmunized patients, it may be necessary to update prior immunizations or to start an immunization program appropriate to the patient's age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57070 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpreting a pneumococcal vaccine response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interpretation of a patient's response to the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is reviewed briefly here and in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing the immunologic response to vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A protective response is 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A normal response in conjugate-immunized children two to five years is a protective response to 50 percent of the serotypes present <strong>only</strong> in the polysaccharide vaccine and for individuals aged 6 to 60 years, a protective response to 70 percent of serotypes tested, provided the conjugate vaccine has not been given. This is regardless of the prevaccine titer. Thus, a titer going from 0.2 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> is nonresponsive, a titer going from 0.4 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> is responsive, and a titer going from 1.5 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> is also responsive, since both are protective. The normal response for individuals over age 65 is not well-defined, but it is probably decreased compared with younger individuals. Multiple factors, including nutritional variables, may contribute to these differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Degrees of nonresponse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can be classified into several phenotypes of polysaccharide nonresponsiveness, based upon their responses to individual serotypes and by the percentage of serotype polysaccharides eliciting an adequate response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91154\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91154 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>].</p><p>As stated above, in children between two and five years of age, a normal response to vaccination with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> is the generation of protective titers (defined as &ge;1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> to more than 50 percent of serotypes tested. In patients six years of age and older, a normal response is the generation of protective titers in more than 70 percent of serotypes tested.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severe phenotype describes patients who have protective antibody concentrations to none, one, or two pneumococcal serotypes tested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91154\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91154 \">table 4</a>). Antibody concentrations are usually at the lowest limit of detection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The moderate phenotype describes partial responses. These patients generate protective titers to fewer than the expected number of serotypes for their age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91154\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91154 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There also appears to be a subset of patients with a rapid loss of antibodies over time. This phenotype is not necessarily based upon poor immunologic memory, since reimmunization with a second dose of polysaccharide vaccine generally triggers a vigorous IgG antibody response. We suggest that patients who initially respond to immunization with the polysaccharide vaccine (especially with clinical improvement) but who experience increasing numbers of infections as time progresses should have titers re-evaluated in order to determine if titers have subsequently dropped. The diagnosis is based upon loss of protective titers, which is usually apparent between six months and two years after an initially successful immunization. This variant has been called the &quot;memory phenotype&quot; of specific antibody deficiency, although this terminology is problematic for the reasons discussed above.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Utility of booster doses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient does not respond to a dose of 23-valent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPV-23) (administered as part of the evaluation), it has been our experience that a second dose of PPV-23 given shortly after the first is of little benefit, because patients continue to have poor responses. These patients may respond to a conjugate vaccine, and we do administer that, but some continue to have recurrent infections since the latter does not correct their underlying problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests of minimal value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of specific antibody deficiency is based upon the measurement of <strong>IgG</strong> antibodies to serotype-specific pneumococcal polysaccharides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/15,24,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,37</a>]. Although infections and immunization with pneumococcal vaccines elicit IgM, IgA, and IgG antibody responses, only IgG antibodies confer long-term protection and are considered indicative of immunity against pneumococcal infections.</p><p>Former methods that simultaneously measure IgG and IgM antibodies gave false-normal antibody concentrations based upon measuring increases in short-lived IgM antibodies. This may be helpful to keep in mind when reading older studies or reviewing a patient's earlier records.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Protein responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In individuals older than two years of age in whom immunoglobulin concentrations are normal, responses to protein antigens are almost always normal. Thus, subsequent measurements of antiprotein antibodies (antitetanus and antidiphtheria toxoid antibodies) are rarely helpful. Poor protein responses are seen in more profound immunodeficiencies, such as common variable immunodeficiency or severe combined immunodeficiency. Low antiprotein antibody concentrations in patients with normal immunoglobulin levels are likely due to the time elapsed since the last immunization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Response to conjugate vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conjugate vaccines contain polysaccharide antigens complexed to immunogenic proteins. These vaccines were developed because normal children under the age of two years demonstrate poor responses to polysaccharide antigens alone. In children under two, the antibody response to these vaccines, whether the antibodies are directed against polysaccharide or protein antigens, is predominately stimulated by the protein component and therefore reflects responsiveness to protein antigens. Thus, the response to these vaccines is not generally used in evaluating polysaccharide nonresponses.</p><p>However, it is our experience that young children who respond poorly to full immunization with conjugated pneumococcal vaccines may respond poorly to polysaccharide vaccines when they get older.

These patients are a minority in our experience. We administer immune globulin replacement therapy to patients with well-documented severe or moderate polysaccharide nonresponsiveness and evidence of recurrent infections, with a proven requirement of antibiotic therapy for improvement. Additional possible indications for immune globulin replacement therapy are uncontrollable recurrent otitis media with risk for permanent hearing loss, presence of bronchiectasis, and in rare patients, multiple antibiotic hypersensitivities that interfere with appropriate treatment.</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy in patients with specific antibody deficiency has not been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, although its efficacy in hypogammaglobulinemia is well-established. In retrospective, uncontrolled series of pediatric patients with specific antibody deficiency, significant decreases in the number of infections were consistently reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/9,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,40</a>].

Occasional patients require either higher doses (500 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every four weeks) or shorter intervals between infusions to prevent infections in the period prior to the next immunoglobulin dose. Immunoglobulin can also be administered subcutaneously at weekly intervals.

Thus, serum trough levels of IgG usually are not helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19435491\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy is begun, it is our practice to discontinue it after one or two years and perform a reassessment of antibody-mediated immunity four to six months after discontinuation, especially in patients who develop recurrent infections. It is helpful to explain this plan to patients when therapy is first initiated. Whenever possible, the discontinuation of IVIG should be scheduled for spring or summer time, when the incidence of infections is usually lower.</p><p>The suggestion to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy periodically is based upon our observation that responses to the polysaccharide vaccine sometimes improve after treatment for 6 to 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This is not seen in all patients, however. The mechanisms for this improvement are unknown. Maturation of the immune system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an immunomodulatory effect of the immune globulin treatment may be involved. Re-evaluation includes measurement of immunoglobulins and specific antibodies, as well as vaccine challenge with the polysaccharide vaccine. The decision to restart immune globulin replacement is based upon clinical course and the laboratory evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of these syndromes is usually benign if they are identified and properly managed.

In contrast, some older patients may eventually develop common variable immunodeficiency.</p><p/><p>Further insights into the pathogenesis of this syndrome in different patients should eventually result in a more reliable assessment of the risk for persistent immune abnormalities and recurrent infections in some of these patients. In the future, the assessment of B cell subsets may help predict which patients will need more prolonged treatment and follow-up. For example, one study suggests that the percentage of circulating memory B cells may predict clinical prognosis in patients diagnosed with selective antibody deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-antibody-deficiency/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Lower percentages of these memory B cells correlated with higher prevalence of bronchiectasis, splenomegaly, and autoimmunity.

It is one of the most commonly identified immune defects among patients presenting with recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe sinopulmonary infections. The term &quot;specific antibody deficiency&quot; is applied when this defect is the only identifiable problem and serum levels of immunoglobulins are normal. (See <a href=\"#H93661856\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis should only be considered in adults and in children over the age of two years, because younger children are normally less responsive to polysaccharide vaccines. In some patients, specific antibody deficiency may represent delayed maturation of the immune system, while in others, it might be the result of a specific molecular defect. (See <a href=\"#H93662076\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations include recurrent sinopulmonary infections due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Infections beyond the normal frequency should prompt evaluation of antibody-mediated immunity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60473\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60473 \">table 1</a>). Many patients also have atopic diseases. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for this disorder involves first assuring that serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and IgG subclasses are normal. Next, a panel of at least 14 specific antipneumococcal antibody concentrations is assessed in immunized children or in adults (regardless of immunization status). If initial levels of antipneumococcal antibodies are not protective, the patient should be immunized with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (not the conjugate vaccine), and specific antibody titers should be obtained from the same laboratory four to six weeks later. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonresponse can be subdivided into severe and moderate phenotypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77185 \">table 5</a>). An additional variant is recognized in which vaccine response is normal, but there is rapid loss of protective titers over 6 to 24 months. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Degrees of nonresponse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management includes prompt treatment of sinopulmonary infections and aggressive treatment of atopic diseases.

(See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Immunization with conjugate vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom infections continue to occur despite vaccination with conjugate vaccine, management of atopic conditions, and aggressive use of antibiotics during infections, we suggest the administration of prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is our experience that most patients do not require this intervention, however. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the few patients in whom infections continue to occur despite all of the above measures, we suggest the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We use standard dosing, in the range of 400 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> infused once every four weeks for intravenous administration or a corresponding dose for subcutaneous administration. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Immune globulin replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy, we suggest interrupting therapy after one to two years of treatment in order to reassess the response to polysaccharide vaccine, as the condition may spontaneously improve (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Immune globulin replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis in children is favorable, because the condition often resolves spontaneously over time.
