Pain management, which includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, is a central component of the complex issues involved in treating patients with burns. Management of anxiety is also important given that high levels of anxiety can increase the perception of pain. Poor pain and anxiety management can also contribute to delayed wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite advances in burn care, inadequate burn pain management still exists during both the acute and rehabilitation phases of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Burn pain is among the most common causes of distress during the first year after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Unfortunately, burn pain management is frequently based upon tradition, personal bias, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> institutional preference rather than evidence-based protocols, which report that such protocols reduce both pain and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>An overview of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options for the management of burn pain is reviewed here. Emergency care and local management of burns and pain are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradigm-based treatment approaches for burn pain control&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10927394\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF BURN PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All burns are painful initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Burn pain varies greatly from patient to patient, shows substantial fluctuation over the hospitalization course, and can be unpredictable due to the complex interaction of anatomic, physiologic, psychosocial, and premorbid behavior issues. Burn patients typically report pain as being severe or excruciating, despite receiving opioid analgesics. </p><p>Burn pain also varies depending upon depth of burn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73309 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial partial-thickness burns result in hyperalgesia and mild-to-moderate pain. They are the most painful burns immediately following the injury. These burns damage only the outer layers of the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate partial-thickness burns are associated with marked hyperalgesia and produce moderate-to-severe pain. Burns at this depth injure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflame sensory receptors in the dermis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep partial-thickness to full-thickness burns are typically characterized by an absence of pain. Hyperalgesia to cutaneous stimulation is uncommon. Acute pain is typically minimal but can be variable and is universally present with respect to the transition zone between burned and unburned skin. The dermis is completely destroyed, including its sensory and vascular structures. There is little to no response to sharp stimuli, yet patients complain of a deep aching pain related to the inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11800749\"><span class=\"h1\">BURN PAIN ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain assessment tools must be practical, reliable, and valid and must be able to assess three dimensions of pain: pain intensity, behavioral reactions, and physiologic reactions. A variety of pain measurement tools have been used with adult and pediatric burn patients. However, there are no randomized trials that have identified an optimal assessment technique for burn patients. The key is to choose an instrument and use it consistently. The most common tools used for adults and children with burn pain include verbal adjective scales, numeric written or visual analog scales, pain assessment in dementia scales, FACES, and FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11800756\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The more common tools for assessing post-burn pain in adults are the adjective scales, which allow a patient to describe the severity of pain in words, such as &quot;none, mild, moderate, or severe&quot; or &quot;no pain, mild, discomforting, distressing, horrible, or excruciating pain&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80858\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80858 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An alternative to the verbal description of pain is the numeric scale, which allows a patient to describe the pain on a scale of increasing severity typically from 0 to 10 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72905 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The numeric scale is administered to the patient verbally or written as a visual analog scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346 \">figure 4</a>). Pain assessment can be challenging in the burned and demented patient. The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale, an observational scoring instrument, is a simple-to-administer, valid, and reliable instrument (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59509 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient#H175312916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;, section on 'Goals of pain control'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11800763\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The measurement of children's pain is much more complex than it is for adults, especially for preverbal children. Typical physiologic indicators, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are unreliable in measuring a child's pain since all are affected by a variety of stressors related to the burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Assessment of pain severity and cognition'</a>.)</p><p>Behavior scales have been devised to measure pain by providing standardized instructions and guidelines for observing behaviors thought to be specific to pain. Facial expression may be the most consistent infant indicator of pain. Observational scales have been developed that are multidimensional and include length of cry, facial expressions, and behavioral states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These scales are easier to use and allow an observer to assess pain as either present or absent without further quantification. The FLACC (Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale) is the most widely used observer rating scale in preverbal children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81819 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. </p><p>Simple self-report pain scales can be used with preschool children. There is no evidence that any one of these scales is more reliable than the other; hence, it is best to select one that the evaluator prefers, and it should be used consistently. When self-report scales are used in conjunction with observational scales, a practitioner may develop a better appreciation of the intensity of the child's response to burn pain and the effectiveness of pain management. The following are examples of pain scales that are commonly used with children:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale is designed for children three years and older (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51021\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51021 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This pain scale uses drawings of faces<sup> </sup>displaying varying degrees of pain and discomfort. Each face communicates a level of pain intensity, and the child is asked to choose the face that most accurately describes their pain level. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The OUCHER scale includes a picture scale for very young children and a numerical scale that can be used in children over five years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are different versions that can be used for children of various races, and an example is shown for a Caucasian boy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75312\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75312 \">figure 6</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11800898\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic agents used to treat burn pain include opioid analgesics, nonopioid analgesics, anxiolytics, and anesthetics. The type of medication used is determined by the severity of pain, the anticipated duration of pain, and intravenous (IV) access. These medications have variable durations of action, particularly in burn patients, and should be titrated to meet the needs of the patient in each clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>To best target the always-present &quot;background pain&quot; associated with acute burn wounds, pharmacologic techniques should provide near-constant plasma levels of analgesics through regularly scheduled administration of long-acting oral opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>), nonopioid analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>), or continuous IV opioid infusion (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) in patients unable to take oral medications. Regularly scheduled benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) may have added value in patients with significant anxiety that contributes to their pain experience. </p><p>A severe burn injury results in physiologic changes that may alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response to drugs in inconsistent ways; hence, deviation from the usual doses may be necessary to avoid toxicity or decreased efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The tables linked to this topic provide dosages of opioids and nonopioid analgesias as recommended for patients without serious pathophysiologic and metabolic changes without altered drug clearance. These dosages serve as a reference point for administering pharmacologic agents to burned patients. Medications may be more potent and have a prolonged effect in the burn patient. Monitoring of the airway, breathing, and circulation is necessary, particularly when intravenous drugs are administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11801092\"><span class=\"h2\">Opioid analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioid analgesics, the most common type of medication used for acute pain relief, are potent and provide a dose-dependent degree of sedation important during burn wound care procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79667 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79047 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Burn pain should be treated aggressively. In fact, the risks of undermedicating burn pain on long-term negative outcomes are well documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], despite growing concern over the perceived overprescription of opiates. A review of intravenous opioid analgesia for adults and children is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Opioids'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p>Opioids can be administered intravenously or orally, depending on IV access, gastrointestinal function, and the patient's ability to cooperate. For severe pain, the optimal route of administration is IV, which provides faster pain relief and can be titrated to meet the individual needs of the patient. </p><p>Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with IV opioids offers the burn patient a safe and efficient method of achieving more flexible analgesia, provided the patient is alert and competent enough to use the device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101248\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101248 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Studies comparing PCA opioid use to other routes of administration in the burn population have shown positive, but limited, benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795594284\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Patient-controlled analgesia'</a>.). </p><p>Oral or gastrointestinal administration of opioids via an enteral tube provides potent pain relief with rapid onset and short duration of action and requires minimal monitoring. Oral transmucosal administration is particularly helpful for performing burn dressing changes in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Intramuscular opioid administration is <strong>not</strong> recommended for use in burn patients. The injections are painful, they need to be repeated frequently, and the absorption is variable due to compartmental fluid shifts.

Dexmedetomidine provides sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia for burned children, with less respiratory depression than other sedatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Ketamine has a long history of use in burn-injured patients, particularly for procedural wound care pain. Studies suggest it is both an effective and safe analgesic in adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and pediatric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] patients with burns. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic agents for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other nonopioid analgesics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), provide mild analgesia and can supplement opiates. They are best suited to treat minor burn pain in the outpatient setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen exhibit a ceiling effect in their dose-response relationship, rendering them unsuitable as single agents for the treatment of severe burn pain; however, their &quot;opioid-sparing&quot; effects may offer benefit when combined with more potent analgesics in such cases. There are no high-quality data from randomized trials that have determined the optimal nonopioid analgesic for burn patients. The mechanism of action and therapeutic use of NSAIDs is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11801106\"><span class=\"h2\">Anxiolytics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anxiety is a common consequence of burns, due to the need for aggressive surgical treatment and debridement of the wounds, and the persistent and repetitive qualities of background and procedural burn pain. The recognition that anxiety can exacerbate acute pain has led to the common practice of using anxiolytic drugs in combination with opioid analgesics, a practice that has become more widespread in burn centers in the past three decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This practice is particularly useful in premedicating patients for wound care, due to the anticipatory anxiety experienced by these patients prior to and during such procedures. </p><p>Benzodiazepine therapy improved postprocedure pain scores in burn patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65653 \">table 7</a>). A trial that randomly assigned 79 burn patients to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 1 mg or placebo in addition to their standard opioid analgesics found no difference between groups in pain score, except in patients with high baseline pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In high baseline pain patients, lorazepam significantly reduced visual analog scale (VAS) pain score ratings. </p><p>Antipsychotic medications are also an option for management of anxiety and agitation associated with burn pain and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-generation antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>) are used adjunctively for treatment or prevention of hyperactive delirium and agitation in critically ill patients.

While the risks of complications following a general anesthetic are typically low in healthy individuals, burn patients have metabolic, physiologic, and thermoregulatory abnormalities as well as possible inhalation injuries that are associated with increased risk of complications of perioperative hypothermia, hypoxemia, and abnormal responses to some anesthetic agents and to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> clearance and volume of distribution are increased in patients with major burns and may require larger bolus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infusion doses to maintain therapeutic plasma drug concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> is an anesthetic agent that can be safely administered and provides effective analgesia without loss of consciousness (ie, moderate sedation) for moderately painful procedures. It can be used for the treatment of burn pain, typically as a 50 percent mixture in 50 percent oxygen, and self-administered by an awake, cooperative, and spontaneously breathing patient via a mouthpiece or mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33</a>]. </p><p>Full anesthetic care capabilities have been extended outside the operating room into specialized, high-volume burn center intensive care units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

In choosing an approach, the team should be guided by the manner in which the patient typically responded to prior stressful medical procedures, if possible. Such responses lie on a continuum ranging from giving up control to the health care professional and desiring little information to seeking out as much information as possible and actively participating in care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The following examples illustrate the types of coping styles to burn and procedural pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance &ndash; Those burn patients who wish to give up control to the health care professional have a tendency toward cognitive avoidance, or an avoidant style of coping mechanism.

Patients may also change their coping style depending on the procedure. As an example, a patient may find it is easier to use distraction techniques for short procedures such as receiving injections, whereas they are more comfortable attending to details of their long wound care sessions and participating when possible. Patients may also change their coping style as they become more familiar and comfortable with the environment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3133671\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avoidance interventions are designed to psychologically distract or distance the patient from the pain.

Prior to a painful procedure, we often have the patient elicit a &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;favorite&quot; place to go. This can be a place where they have been before (eg, a favorite vacation spot) or simply a place that they imagine to be relaxing and safe. The clinician then simply cues the patient with the details that they have provided and we encourage them to imagine this place during their subsequent wound care. </p><p>Limited evidence suggests that guided imagery is effective in reducing the sensory and emotional components of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research advocates the use of imagery for reduction of pain intensity and distress for cancer pain and for the management of mild-to-severe acute pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3133302\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypnotic analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness characterized by an increased receptivity to suggestion, ability to alter perceptions and sensations, and an increased capacity for dissociation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

When a person becomes anxious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> experiences pain, breathing can become shallow and irregular due to the increased muscle tension in our chest wall. Such shallow breathing, known as thoracic breathing, leads to an increase in muscle tension and subsequent heightened pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. </p><p>Deep breathing techniques allow patients to become aware of shallow irregular breathing and leads to relaxation that may alleviate some pain. Children can be taught bubble blowing or blowing on a pinwheel to encourage deep breathing. Adults can be taught to place a hand on their stomach and to take a breath deep enough that it passes through their chest and fills their stomach (shallow breathing is more in the chest and will not cause as much hand movement on the stomach). Their hand should rise and fall with the stomach. Exhalation is the most important part of deep breathing exercises and should not be rushed. Diaphragmatic breathing is central to all forms of relaxation and is simple and time efficient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3133838\"><span class=\"h3\">Progressive muscle relaxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle tension increases as patients experience stress and pain; hence, the focused effort on relaxing and tensing muscles in a controlled manner diverts the attention away from the pain. Progressive muscle relaxation is a technique used to reduce anxiety associated with painful stimuli, such as burn dressing changes, by alternately tensing then relaxing muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Muscles are sequentially tensed (10 seconds) and relaxed (20 seconds) through various parts of the body, and the technique can be performed during dressing changes.

(See <a href=\"#H10927394\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of burn pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain assessment instruments use visual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> numeric scales to assess pain intensity, behavioral reactions, and physiologic reactions. There is no one optimal assessment technique for burn patients. The key is to choose an instrument and use it consistently. (See <a href=\"#H11800749\" class=\"local\">'Burn pain assessment techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic agents used to treat burn pain include opioid analgesics, nonopioid analgesics, anxiolytics, and anesthetics. The type of medication used is determined by the severity of pain, the anticipated duration of pain, and intravenous (IV) access. (See <a href=\"#H11800898\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>), the most common type of medication used for acute pain relief, are potent and provide a dose-dependent degree of sedation important during burn wound care procedures. (See <a href=\"#H11801092\" class=\"local\">'Opioid analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonopioid analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) provide short-term effective analgesia and sedation that may be helpful for limited burn debridement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dressing changes in adults and children. (See <a href=\"#H11801099\" class=\"local\">'Nonopioid analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiolytic drugs (eg, benzodiazepines) are useful in premedicating patients for wound care due to the anticipatory anxiety experienced by these patients prior to and during such procedures. (See <a href=\"#H11801106\" class=\"local\">'Anxiolytics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic treatments should be adjunctive to pharmacologic approaches when treating pain and anxiety in the burn patient. These approaches include cognitive distraction, information provision, relaxation, coping skills, and cognitive behavioral techniques. (See <a href=\"#H11800906\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic treatment options'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brown NJ, Kimble RM, Gramotnev G, et al.
