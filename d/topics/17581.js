The designation Q fever (from Query) was made in 1935 following an outbreak of a febrile illness in slaughterhouse workers in Queensland, Australia. The disease is reportable in the United States, and its agent, <em>C. burnetii</em>, is a potential agent of bioterrorism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-q-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying and managing casualties of biological terrorism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment and prevention of Q fever will be reviewed here. The microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Q fever, as well as Q fever endocarditis, are discussed separately.

Acute and persistent infection can be distinguished through their clinical presentation and the results of serologic testing. A detailed discussion of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Q fever is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Q fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, the clinical manifestations of Q fever were typically divided into acute Q fever and chronic Q fever. However, patients were sometimes diagnosed with chronic Q fever without a clear clinical focus of disease. This has led to controversy over how to define chronic Q fever. Thus, rather than use the term &quot;chronic Q fever&quot; to describe a clinical condition, we prefer to describe the specific disease manifestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107414\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107414 \">table 1</a>).

However, the duration of treatment and the need for additional agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery are based upon the specific disease manifestation, as well as the patient&rsquo;s underlying comorbidities. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute Q fever should have a transthoracic echocardiogram performed. Individuals without valvular disease can be treated with a single agent for a short duration. However, those with valvular disease will require prolonged therapy with two agents to prevent endocarditis.

To identify asymptomatic infection, serologic screening for Q fever should be performed in pregnant women who are at high risk for infection with <em>C. burnetii</em> (preferably during the first trimester).

However, the duration of treatment should be extended, and additional agents added for those with valvular disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> certain cardiomyopathies.

For most, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, a macrolide, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-q-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> (500 mg twice daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (500 mg once daily or 250 mg twice daily) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>. These agents have been found to be effective in treating Q fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-q-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and are more potent in vitro and better tolerated than erythromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-q-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although they appear to be effective in decreasing the duration of symptoms in patients with acute Q fever, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> has greater efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-q-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMP-SMX (160 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily) is the treatment of choice for pregnant women; data suggest that this agent can decrease the risk of placentitis, obstetrical complications, as well as persistent Q fever infection in the mother.

Q fever occurred in 2 of 2555 (0.08 percent) vaccinated employees, compared with 55 of 1365 (4 percent) unvaccinated employees. The two cases in vaccinated employees occurred within a few days of vaccination (ie, before immunity had developed), and were felt to represent pre-existing disease rather than vaccine failure.

Acute and persistent infection can be distinguished through their clinical presentation and the results of serologic testing. Patients with acute Q fever should have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed to further guide treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"#H1321644527\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In non-pregnant patients without valvulopathy or cardiomyopathy who have symptomatic acute Q fever, we treat with antibiotics to reduce the duration of symptoms (see <a href=\"#H517589330\" class=\"local\">'Whom to treat'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For adults, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg PO twice daily for 14 days), rather than other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

However, the choice of antibiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> versus TMP-SMX) depends upon the age of the child and the severity of disease. (See <a href=\"#H309322296\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We treat pregnant women with acute Q fever, even if they are asymptomatic.

Tetracyclines are generally contraindicated in pregnancy given the risk of fetal bone and teeth malformations and maternal hepatotoxicity.

(See <a href=\"#H3996428438\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring after treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29649097\" class=\"local\">'Serologic monitoring during treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and non-pregnant patients with persistent localized infection (eg, endocarditis, vascular infection, osteomyelitis), we suggest the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> rather than doxycycline alone or other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
