It happens more often in children than adults.</p><p>As a parent, it can be scary to see your child sleepwalk. But it's important to know that sleepwalking does not mean that your child is sick or has a medical problem.</p><p>Most children outgrow their sleepwalking as they get older.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285350447\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sleepwalking?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleepwalking usually happens in the first part of the night. Sleepwalking children can crawl, walk, run, or talk while asleep. They might try to do something, like start to get dressed or walk out of the house. When children sleepwalk, they can have their eyes open and a blank look on their face. They will not respond to you when you talk to them.</p><p>An episode of sleepwalking can last a few seconds to minutes, but usually lasts 10 to 20 minutes. After the episode is over, the child will fall back asleep. This might be in his or her own bed or in another place in the house.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285350462\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child is sleepwalking by learning about your child's behavior and doing an exam.</p><p>Some children might need tests to make sure another condition isn't causing their night-time behavior. Doctors might order tests if children sleepwalk very often or have any of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loud snoring or gasping for breath during sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wetting the bed (if the child used to stay dry at night)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleepwalking 2 or more times each night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures, which are waves of abnormal activity in the brain that can make people pass out or move or behave strangely</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285350477\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help my child when he or she sleepwalks?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can help your child by making sure he or she doesn't get hurt when sleepwalking. To help keep your child safe, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the windows and doors locked at night so your child can't get outside.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your child does not sleep in a top bunk bed (if he or she sleeps in a bunk bed).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep sharp, breakable, or dangerous items away from your child's bed or out of the bedroom.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a safety gate in the doorway of your child's bedroom or at the top of the stairs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the floor clear of clutter or other objects that could make your child trip and fall.</p><p/><p>When your child sleepwalks, there are things you should and should not do. You should <strong>not</strong> try to hold your child down or wake him or her up. Instead, you should gently guide your child back to his or her bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285350492\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need other treatment for sleepwalking?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. If your child doesn't sleepwalk too often and it doesn't cause problems, your child will not need any other treatment. Most children outgrow their sleepwalking as they get older.</p><p>If the sleepwalking causes problems or your child doesn't outgrow it, talk with the doctor or nurse about treatment. Possible treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A behavior plan called &quot;scheduled awakening&quot; &ndash; This involves waking your child every night (for a few moments) at a certain time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285350507\"><span class=\"h1\">Can sleepwalking be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Children are more likely to sleepwalk in certain situations, such as when they do not get enough sleep or have a fever.</p><p>You might be able to prevent sleepwalking by making sure your child gets enough sleep. To do this, try to stick to a regular sleep schedule. In general, children 3 to 5 years old should get 10 to 13 hours of sleep (including naps). Older children should get 9 to 12 hours of sleep each night, and teens should get 8 to 10 hours.</p><p>If your child has trouble falling asleep or getting a good night's sleep, here are some things you can try:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a set bedtime and bedtime routine for your child.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your child's bedtime and wake-up time about the same every day (on school and non-school days).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make the hour before bed a quiet time, and avoid high-energy activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your child's room quiet and dark. If your child is scared of the dark, use a night light that is not too bright.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don't have a TV in your child's bedroom.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285350522\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=night-terrors-confusional-arousals-and-nightmares-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Night terrors, confusional arousals, and nightmares in children (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
