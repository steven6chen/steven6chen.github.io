Patients with MTC can be cured only by complete resection of the thyroid tumor and any local and regional metastases. We recommend total thyroidectomy for patients with hereditary forms of MTC (MEN types 2A [MEN2A] and 2B [MEN2B]).</p><p>The American Thyroid Association (ATA) has published guidelines on the management of patients with either the inherited or sporadic forms of MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Our recommendations are largely in keeping with these guidelines. The treatment of hereditary MTC is discussed briefly below and in more detail separately.

We measure serum calcium (to rule out hyperparathyroidism requiring concomitant surgical intervention) and plasma fractionated metanephrines (as the initial screen for pheochromocytoma). If pheochromocytoma is found, it should be removed first.

In addition, family members should undergo <em>RET</em> mutation screening.

The multicentric and bilateral nature of MTC (and its precursor C-cell hyperplasia) in all the MEN2 syndromes means that total thyroidectomy is the only way to cure MEN2-related MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. MTC in patients with MEN2B is more aggressive than in MEN2A, and total thyroidectomy is often not curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In such cases, surgery can lead to a reduction in tumor burden or effective palliation. In one large follow-up study published in 1985, death from MTC occurred in 50 percent of those with MEN2B but only 9.7 percent of those with MEN2A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Cervical nodal metastases are common in patients with palpable MTC or higher calcitonin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Prophylactic dissection of nodal tissue in the central compartment from the hyoid bone to the innominate veins and medial to the jugular veins is routinely performed except in patients with very low levels of calcitonin, where total thyroidectomy alone may be preferred (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Preventive surgery'</a> below). The lateral jugular and mediastinal nodes should be carefully evaluated, followed by modified neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinal dissections if positive nodes are identified.

Although data are limited, EBRT may be beneficial in minimizing local recurrences in patients with extensive extrathyroid extension. Palliative radiation therapy may be used to diminish the tumor burden in the neck and to prevent local recurrence. Whether morbidity or mortality is improved remains questionable. The management of residual or recurrent disease is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis#H2716622\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Management of persistent/recurrent disease'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with progressive metastatic disease who cannot be treated by surgery or radiotherapy should be considered candidates for systemic therapy. Newer, target-directed drug therapies are promising. An obvious approach is to target <em>RET</em> signaling since this is the primary defect in MEN2 syndromes. The germline <em>RET</em> genotype may influence the response to drug therapy. This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The goal in patients with known <em>RET</em> mutations (but without clinically apparent disease) is to perform a prophylactic thyroidectomy before MTC develops or when it is still confined to the thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children with certain <em>RET</em> mutations can develop clinically apparent MTC at an early age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58578\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58578 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>In observational studies, the 10-year survival of MTC ranges from 61 to 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. The important prognostic factors that predict adverse outcome include older age at diagnosis, extent of primary tumor, nodal disease, and distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. In children identified as carrying a <em>RET</em> mutation by genetic screening, MTC can be cured or prevented by early thyroidectomy. In some studies of children with MEN2 mutations undergoing preventive surgery, there were no lymph node metastases or postoperative residual MTC when the basal serum calcitonin levels were &lt;30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is not universal agreement, our approach to determining the optimal timing of thyroidectomy is based upon the specific DNA mutation in the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene occurring in the family and, in some cases, serum calcitonin levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71392 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In an analysis of 50 children identified through genetic screening who had undergone a previous total thyroidectomy, 88 percent had undetectable stimulated serum calcitonin levels 5 to 10 years later; children with undetectable levels had undergone their surgery before age eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Although some <em>RET</em> mutations (eg, <em>RET</em> codons 634 and 918) are uniformly associated with more aggressive and earlier onset MTC, there is heterogeneity in presentation with other <em>RET</em> mutations, even among different families with the same mutation or within an individual family having the same <em>RET</em> mutation. Therefore, measurement of serum calcitonin (basal or stimulated) may be helpful for establishing the timing of thyroidectomy. This approach is consistent with clinical practice guidelines published by the ATA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p><em>RET</em> mutations can be categorized as highest, high, and moderate risk, referring to the potential risk for local and distant MTC metastases at an early age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71392 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]. The suggested timing of thyroidectomy is based upon evidence of age-dependent and codon-specific progression of early MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Highest risk</strong> &ndash; For children with a predisposition for MEN2B, most commonly associated with a germline mutation in codon 918, we suggest thyroidectomy during the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. Total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection during the first year of life is advocated, given that metastatic disease has been reported in one-year-old children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and that later surgery is often not curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/6,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27</a>]. Typical physical features are not necessarily present in an affected neonate within an MEN2B family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], so the absence of such features does not obviate the need for early diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High risk</strong> &ndash; For children with mutations in codons 634 or 883, we suggest thyroidectomy at or before age five years, with the exact timing based on detection of an elevated serum calcitonin level (above the upper limit of normal).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate risk</strong> (B) &ndash; For patients with MTC and <em>RET</em> mutations other than M918T, C634, and A883F in codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 630, 666, 768, 790, 804, 891, and 912, we suggest total thyroidectomy during childhood or young adulthood, based on detection of an elevated serum calcitonin level (above the upper limit of normal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients with a single mutation on codon 804 are thought to have atypical MEN2B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/22,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32,33</a>]. This mutation has low penetrance. While initially thought to be associated with late onset of MTC and an indolent course, compared with the codon 918 and 634 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], early onset with metastatic disease has been reported, and these MTCs are associated with a second germline or somatic (tandem) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. We therefore recommend that these individuals undergo surgery by an age depending on the identity of this second (tandem) mutation.</p><p>Fewer than 1 percent of MEN2 families have no detectable <em>RET</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>]. If no genetic information is available to show a specific germline <em>RET</em> mutation from an affected individual in a known MEN2 family, prophylactic thyroidectomy should be performed when a pentagastrin stimulation test reveals a peak calcitonin level &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>. There are few data using the calcium stimulation as a confirmatory test in patients with elevated basal calcitonin levels, and cut points for the discrimination of normal, C-cell hyperplasia, and MTC have not been standardized. These tests are reviewed in detail separately.

In very young children, the parathyroid glands may be difficult to identify intraoperatively, thus increasing the risk of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. If the parathyroid glands cannot be identified and there are no suspicious lymph nodes on preoperative ultrasound or intraoperative inspection, the surgeon may reasonably forgo central neck dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A more limited central node dissection, taking care to avoid disrupting the parathyroid glands or laryngeal nerves, has yielded good results in children who were regularly screened biochemically for MTC with a calcium infusion test and operated on when the test first became positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One would expect similarly good results from this surgical approach in patients who carry the gene for MTC and are operated on before they have any clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC.</p><p>Given the rarity of this disease and the potential complications of a total thyroidectomy in young children, all patients should be referred to academic centers with expertise in MEN2, where an experienced pediatric or endocrine surgeon can perform the required surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pheochromocytoma occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and in approximately 50 percent of those with type 2B (MEN2B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].

Prior to unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy, patients should be treated with alpha blockade and counselled regarding volume expansion.
