Victims can be young and apparently healthy, and while many of these deaths are unexplained, a substantial number harbor underlying undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. As a result, there is great interest in early identification of at-risk individuals for whom appropriate activity restrictions can be implemented to minimize the risk of SCD.</p><p>The majority of SCD events in athletes are due to malignant arrhythmias, usually ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). In individuals with certain cardiac disorders (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, etc), athletics may increase the likelihood of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> in two ways: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged physical training may induce changes in cardiac structure (eg, interstitial fibrosis, disruption of normal myocardial architecture, dilation of right and left ventricle) in susceptible individuals that may create pathologic arrhythmogenic substrate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immediate physiologic demands of intense athletics (eg, hemodynamic overload, catecholamine release, electrolyte imbalance) may trigger malignant arrhythmias in susceptible individuals with underlying cardiac abnormalities.</p><p/><p>As with screening for any condition, the primary purpose of screening athletes for cardiac pathology is to identify patients at higher risk of SCD whose prognosis could be improved with an intervention (in this case, activity restriction or modification, or other specific therapy targeted at the underlying pathology). The approach to screening athletes depends, in part, upon the age of the athlete along with the anticipated level of activity (ie, competitive versus recreational athletics).</p><p>The approach to screening athletes for underlying cardiac disease that might predispose to SCD, including whom to screen and how, will be reviewed here. Issues related to the management of athletes with known disease as well as the broader range of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances that occur in athletes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Athletes: Risk of sudden cardiac death&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic abnormalities and conduction disturbances in athletes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=athletes-with-arrhythmias-treatment-and-returning-to-athletic-participation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Athletes with arrhythmias: Treatment and returning to athletic participation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A separate issue is screening asymptomatic persons, particularly men over age 50, who are about to begin a recreational exercise program. The exercise prescription is also important in older individuals who are beginning to exercise. The approach to recreational exercise and the prescription of exercise for cardiovascular disease prevention are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Recommendations from major societies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'The exercise prescription'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14805305\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although definitions sometime vary from study to study, it is important to define the populations of athletes as well as the level of competition in which the athletes are engaged.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young athletes &ndash; Most commonly, &quot;young athletes&quot; refers to those in high school and college, but applies in general to individuals under age 35 in whom SCD is usually due to a variety of congenital heart diseases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Masters athletes &ndash; Adult, or &quot;masters,&quot; athletes include individuals over age 35 in whom SCD is most commonly due to coronary heart disease. Such sports programs primarily include apparently normal and healthy individuals over the age of 35, although many participants are greater than 50 or 60 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Competitive athletes &ndash; Competitive athletes engage in organized team or individual sports in which there is regular competition, placing a premium on achievement. This definition implies that individuals are regularly engaged in high levels of training and competition and may not have the will or the judgment to limit their activity. This most frequently applies to high school, college, and professional sports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recreational athletes &ndash; Recreational athletes generally participate for health <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enjoyment purposes and do not typically have the same pressures to excel. Activity levels may still be vigorous, and the distinction from competitive athletics may be elusive in the individual case. However, defining recreational athletics separately permits the development of guidelines for noncompetitive athletes with cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14805360\"><span class=\"h1\">WHICH ATHLETES ARE AT RISK?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For persons with an underlying cardiac disorder, both competitive and recreational athletics can pose a risk of SCD, although the risk is related to the severity of the underlying pathology and the level of exertion. Athletes under 35 years of age are far more likely to suffer SCD from an underlying inherited structural heart disease (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary artery anomalies, Marfan syndrome, etc) or an inherited arrhythmia syndrome (eg, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, etc), while those over 35 years of age are more likely to have coronary heart disease. A more detailed discussion of the epidemiology and the various pathologies associated with SCD in athletes is presented separately.

Victims are usually young and apparently healthy, and while many of these deaths are unexplained, a substantial number harbor underlying undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. The majority of SCD events in athletes are due to malignant arrhythmias, usually ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Professional societies in both North America and Europe have published recommendations for preparticipation screening for young athletes (those younger than 35 years of age) that agree regarding the need for screening. While the societies are largely in agreement with the approach to screening (including personal history, family history, and physical examination for all athletes), the most significant difference is that the American groups recommend a pre-participation history and physical examination alone without further routine testing, while the Europeans include a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations for screening by expert groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few data and no randomized trials on the impact screening programs have on the incidence of SCD in athletes. In addition, there are no direct comparisons of the North American and European approaches to screening. Observational data are limited by the low incidence of SCD and the heterogeneity of both populations studied and screening protocols. While there are data that show improved outcomes with screening, the absolute benefit (based on the overall low event rates) is small. (See <a href=\"#H1128266743\" class=\"local\">'Impact of screening program on the outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to the devastating nature of SCD and the potential to detect many of the associated disorders with noninvasive testing, there is a strong incentive to screen athletes for these disorders prior to athletic participation. However, there are a number of obstacles to widespread screening, including the large numbers of competitive athletes, low prevalence of congenital heart disease, and the impact of uncertain or false-positive results, as well as logistic inadequacies and legal considerations.
