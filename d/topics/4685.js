For patients with cutaneous melanoma, the prognosis is related to the location, depth, and other biologic properties of the primary tumor, and the presence or absence of locoregional and distant metastatic disease. Surgery represents the principal treatment modality for primary cutaneous melanoma, and adequate excision is important to lessen the risk of a local recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Local recurrence is defined (albeit somewhat arbitrarily) as tumor regrowth within 2 cm of the surgical scar following definitive excision of a primary melanoma with appropriate surgical margins in order to standardize treatment endpoints in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Recurrences that are more than 2 cm from the primary lesion but are not beyond the regional nodal basin are termed in transit metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The management of locally recurrent melanoma will be discussed here. The management of in transit metastases is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF LOCAL RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local recurrence potentially can arise as a result of one of several mechanisms. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete excision of the primary &ndash; Local recurrence may be due to incomplete excision of the primary tumor, even in the absence of a &quot;positive surgical margin&quot; in the resection specimen. Sampling error can prevent an accurate analysis of all margins of the surgical specimen. In theory, a wider excision with more generous margins might prevent this form of local recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous melanoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In transit metastases &ndash; Another source of melanoma regrowth in close proximity to the original primary tumor is microsatellite or &quot;in transit&quot; melanoma nodules that are not excised with the primary tumor mass because they are physically discontinuous from it. The presumed mechanism, lymphatic spread, is supported by the observation that the presence of satellite metastases in a primary excision specimen increases the risk for a subsequent local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second primary melanomas &ndash; Misclassification of a new (de novo) primary melanoma that arises at the periphery of a previously excised melanoma may also be confused with a local recurrence. Histologic evidence of a melanoma precursor lesion within a suspected local recurrence should suggest the correct diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematogenous dissemination &ndash; A local recurrence can result from hematogenous dissemination with implantation of tumor cells close to the original excision site. A close association between hematogenous dissemination and local recurrence is suggested by data showing a high rate of distant metastases as the next site of relapse in patients with a local melanoma recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR LOCAL RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of local recurrence as a first event in disease progression is approximately 3 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The majority of local recurrences occur early, but delayed recurrences are not infrequent and are more common with thinner lesions than with thicker ones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57991\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57991 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Several risk factors for local recurrence have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor thickness and excision margin &minus; Thick primary melanomas are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. However, resection of large amounts of normal tissue can affect both function and cosmesis, thus limiting the extent of surgical margins employed in some cases. Recommendations for margin width vary according to tumor thickness and are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Wide local excision'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic site and ulceration &ndash; Melanomas arising in the head and neck region and melanomas with ulceration of the primary tumor are at high risk of local recurrence. In the Intergroup Melanoma Trial, the incidence of local recurrence for primary lesions of the proximal extremities, trunk, distal extremities, and head and neck area were 1, 3, 5, and 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among those with melanomas at low-risk sites (ie, proximal extremities or trunk), the risk of local recurrence was significantly increased if ulceration was present (6.6 versus 1.1 percent without ulceration). Those with primary lesions in high-risk locations (head and neck or distal extremities) also had a significantly increased risk of local recurrence if ulceration was present (16.2 versus 2.1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desmoplastic histology &ndash; Desmoplastic melanomas have been associated with substantially higher rates of local recurrence than other cutaneous melanomas. For this reason, adjuvant radiation therapy is often considered following initial resection of these melanomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Desmoplastic melanoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma#H8198913\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy in the management of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous primary lesions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node positive disease &ndash; Patients who have lymph node involvement (especially multiple positive bulky nodes or extracapsular extension) are at an increased risk of local recurrence as well as in the regional nodal basin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma#H8199445\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy in the management of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Regional lymph nodes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Satellitosis &ndash; The presence of satellite lesions increases the risk of melanoma recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/3,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,7</a>]. In the Intergroup Melanoma Trial there was a significantly higher rate of local recurrence in patients with satellite lesions (32 versus 2 percent in those without satellite lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL RECURRENCE AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of a local recurrence in a patient with cutaneous melanoma following adequate resection of the primary tumor has historically been associated with a relatively poor prognosis. In the Intergroup Melanoma Trial, the 5 and 10-year survival rates were 9 and 5 percent, respectively, when local recurrence was the first site of failure. In contrast, there was an 86 percent five-year survival rate for those who did not develop a local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/1,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6</a>]. More recent series that predate the approvals of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> and BRAF inhibitors suggest 5 and 10-year survival rates in the 50 and 35 percent range, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Given these advances in systemic therapy, the survival of patients with a local recurrence continues to improve.</p><p>Whether distant metastases result from local or regional recurrences rather than as a manifestation of aggressive tumor biology is not known. Although it is unlikely that local recurrences are responsible for seeding most distant metastases, local recurrences may seed distant metastases in a subset of patients, and all reasonable measures should be taken to avoid a local recurrence. </p><p>Historically, the use of a skin graft to cover the melanoma excision site was advocated to allow early detection of a local recurrence with the goal of improving survival. However, multivariate analysis of the Intergroup Melanoma Trial found that closure by skin graft versus primary closure with full-thickness flap had no impact on survival rates, even after accounting for all other factors that influenced the risk of a local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>One unusual form of &quot;true local recurrence&quot; may be an exception that can be associated with a better prognosis. A local recurrence that is contiguous with the scar and that bears an in situ component that can be excised with a 1 to 2 cm margin is associated with five-year survival rates as high as 89 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These lesions have been termed &quot;true local cutaneous recurrent melanoma.&quot; Many of these lesions probably represent new primary melanomas occurring within a &quot;field defect&quot; (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of local recurrence'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop a local recurrence of their primary melanoma have a range of therapeutic options available to them. Given the variable availability of these therapies, these patients should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board with expertise in melanoma management whenever possible. These discussions should include both the initial work up as well as the therapeutic options, which can range from simple surgical excision through various regional treatments to systemic therapies potentially used in a neoadjuvant fashion. There are numerous clinical trials available for this group of patients as well. A summary of various staging and therapeutic options are outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556504976\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a local recurrence of melanoma should undergo a careful evaluation for other sites of recurrence, including a careful history and physical examination and appropriate imaging studies. The evaluation of patients with locoregional recurrence of melanoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma#H2817889\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging work-up and surveillance after treatment of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical stage III and local recurrence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-in-melanoma#H1957558\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Approach to patient imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556505035\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strong consideration should be given to performing lymphatic mapping and a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in appropriate patients with isolated local recurrence or in transit disease, because of its prognostic significance and the potential for additional therapeutic options if the SLN biopsy is positive. Factors influencing this decision should be similar to those for patients with an aggressive primary melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>There are two main issues pertaining to SLN biopsy for local recurrence. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accuracy after wide excision &ndash; The most relevant data come from studies in patients who underwent SLN biopsy after a wide local excision. These have suggested that a SLN biopsy is accurate and reflects the nodal status of the draining regional basin:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a series of 104 patients from MD Anderson, the SLN was identified in 103 (99 percent) and was positive in 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Over a 51-month median follow-up period there were no nodal basin recurrences in any of the patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another series of 76 patients, the sentinel lymph node was successfully identified in 75 cases (98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this study, 11 patients (15 percent) had a positive SLN biopsy. Among those with a negative SLN, only 3 of 64 (4 percent) subsequently developed regional lymph node recurrence in conjunction with a systemic recurrence, and one patient had an isolated regional recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognostic significance in this patient population &ndash; In a study involving 30 patients with local or in transit recurrence, the median disease-free survival was 16 months when SLN biopsy was positive and 36 months when SLNs were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite the limited number of patients in this study, these data suggest that SLN biopsy has prognostic significance in patients with local and in transit metastases.</p><p/><p>Regarding the role of SLN biopsy in patients with in transit disease, a study from Duke University looking at SLN biopsy in 33 patients with in transit disease found that the technique could be performed successfully in patients who had undergone a previous SLN biopsy, although a previous biopsy can make a repeat procedure more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Using a technique in which the most proximal in transit lesion was injected with radioactive sulfa colloid, the sentinel lymph node was identified 97 percent of the time and was positive 33 percent of the time. There was a statistically significant difference in the time to development of distant metastatic disease in patients who had a positive sentinel lymph node as compared with those who did not. The authors suggested considering SLN biopsy when patients had a small volume of in transit disease (&lt;3 lesions) and where surgery was being considered as the primary treatment modality. The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with more advanced in transit disease is less clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is the treatment of choice for most melanoma local recurrences. For patients who are examined at regular intervals following the treatment of a primary melanoma, local recurrences are more likely to be detected at a stage in which they can be successfully managed by surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Most melanoma surgeons recommend the use of resection margins for recurrences that are sufficient to ensure a grossly and microscopically clear margin, although there are no data that definitively address this issue. Radical surgery employing extensive margins for a local recurrence is not justified. However, even when more conservative margins are used to excise a local recurrence, the surgical defect often requires use of a skin graft, because of the previous wide local excision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with melanoma local recurrences are at high risk for the development of disseminated disease.</p><p>Randomized clinical trials are not available to address the value of adjuvant immunotherapy in patients who are rendered disease free following resection of a local recurrence. However, patients who have undergone resection of a local recurrence and have no other evidence of disease could be considered equivalent to stage III and have been included in adjuvant trials; as such, adjuvant therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> or clinical trial enrollment utilizing immunotherapy or targeted therapy approaches should be discussed with patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma#H157827536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;, section on 'General approach to adjuvant therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267696561\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated limb perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resection is not an option for some patients because of the extensive nature of their local recurrences. For such patients, hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) may be an effective treatment option if the recurrence is located on an extremity.</p><p>ILP is more commonly applied to patients with extensive in transit metastases, and these patients predominate in most series. The technique and results with this approach in patients with advanced locoregional disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;, section on 'Regional chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267696567\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant ILP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for applying isolated limb perfusion (ILP) in the adjuvant (ie, postoperative setting) is to eliminate any microscopic residual cells that may remain locoregionally. Although adjuvant limb perfusion decreases the incidence of both in transit and local recurrences, clinical trials have not demonstrated an improvement in survival. The results with adjuvant ILP are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267696573\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated limb infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the technical complexities associated with hyperthermic ILP, investigators have examined intraarterial infusion of chemotherapy alone as an alternative. This technique and results in patients with in transit metastases and local recurrences are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;, section on 'Regional chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267696638\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic treatment of melanoma results in a complete response in a fraction of patients with disseminated disease. Such an approach is generally reserved for situations in which the local recurrence is not readily resectable. In some cases, initial treatment with systemic therapy can decrease tumor burden, allowing surgery to be performed with less morbidity.</p><p>Systemic treatment options that have been shown to alter the natural history of metastatic melanoma include therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors or interleukin-2 (IL-2), and molecularly targeted therapy against BRAF and MEK in patients whose tumors contain a V600 mutation in BRAF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regional therapy with isolated limb infusion or hyperthermic ILP has been commonly used in cases of unresectable local recurrences with or without in transit metastases for limb salvage and has resulted in long-term survival in a fraction of patients. More recently, however, systemic therapy appears to have gained preference to regional therapy options. To date, there are no head-to-head trials comparing regional therapy with new systemic therapy approaches. There are currently two studies looking at isolated limb infusion, with systemic immunotherapy given either before (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02115243?term=NCT02115243&rank=1&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPPxEFf/r6UYqbgoxV4vMsN+oBFCyv5P5bEu2L4oXju4ZjApiSM1hHhdxtumH3GiWRg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7607\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02115243</a>) or after (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01323517?term=NCT01323517&rank=1&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPOxb/lIGkd+vcXQiv7mYqVKsSEOt75WfANhGywdKafGJs7t+9ARgo0Eyyl8YmFi82g=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7607\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01323517</a>) isolated limb infusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Intralesional therapy of cutaneous disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intralesional therapy has several goals including local disease control with limited systemic toxicity and the theoretical potential to induce a systemic antitumor immune reaction. Intralesional therapy historically has focused on patients with unresectable, multiple, or locally advanced stage IIIB and IIIC disease as well as patients with accessible stage IVa disease. </p><p>The modern era of intralesional therapies for melanoma dates back to the early 1960s; initially intralesional BCG was used in an attempt to eradicate dermal and subcutaneous melanoma lesions with the hope of generating a systemic immune response. In early reports tumor regressions were seen in approximately 90 percent of injected lesions with regression of uninjected subcutaneous lesions occurring approximately 20 percent of the time. Regression of visceral disease, while reported, was a rare observation using BCG. As the use of BCG became more widespread, some significant toxicities were reported including severe skin reactions, systemic infections, and even anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These toxicities have led to a marked reduction in BCG&rsquo;s clinical use.</p><p>Other intralesional agents that have been studied include the cytokines IL-2, interferon gamma, and interferon alfa. Generally, these agents are associated with high response rates locally at the site of injection but no systemic response.</p><p>Three compounds that are of increased interest currently are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talimogene-laherparepvec-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talimogene laherparepvec</a> (T-VEC), HLA-B7 gene therapy (allovectin 7), and PV-10 because of the perception that they may generate a specific anti-tumor immune response and be associated with a higher systemic response rate than is seen with other compounds injected into tumors.</p><p>At the current time, only T-VEC has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Other intralesional therapies are limited to use in clinical trials. Current trials are looking at these agents not only by themselves but also in combination with other immunologic modulators like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104551421\"><span class=\"h3\">Talimogene laherparepvec</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Production of GM-CSF within tumor has been used in an effort to enhance cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

However, aggressive therapy is warranted to minimize morbidity and potentially to increase survival given the favorable outcomes in a subset of patients. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Local recurrence and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients presenting with a local recurrence should be carefully evaluated for evidence of distant metastases. In general this should include consideration of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H556504976\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a local recurrence and no other evidence of disease, we recommend surgical resection with lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). If lymph node disease is identified, surgery should include a simultaneous or subsequent completion lymph node dissection. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have undergone resection of a local recurrence and have no other evidence of disease, discussion of adjuvant immunotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> or participation in a clinical trial is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a local recurrence (with or without regional nodal recurrence) and no evidence of systemic disease, but the local recurrence is felt to be unresectable, options include neoadjuvant systemic therapy to downstage the recurrence, isolated limb infusion, isolated limb perfusion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intralesional therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talimogene-laherparepvec-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talimogene laherparepvec</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a local recurrence and evidence of systemic disease elsewhere, we suggest systemic therapy using targeted agents or immunotherapy as a first line of therapy. Use of intralesional therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talimogene-laherparepvec-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talimogene laherparepvec</a> may be considered in patients who are felt not to be candidates for systemic therapy. Surgery is occasionally utilized in a palliative fashion for control of locoregional recurrences in the presence of distant disease.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Balch CM, Urist MM, Karakousis CP, et al.
