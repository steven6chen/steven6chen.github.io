EM-like skin lesions appeared at the site of these tick bites, but serologic tests in such patients consistently failed to show evidence of infection with <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, a finding that fits with the fact that the vector for Lyme disease (<em>Ixodes scapularis</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73802\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73802 \">picture 2</a>) was unknown or uncommon in these locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Experimental studies subsequently revealed that <em>A. americanum</em> is an incompetent vector for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu stricto, the sole cause of Lyme disease in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Over the next 20 years, this illness was given a variety of names, including Southern Lyme disease and Masters' disease. The most widely used name, Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), may be misleading since this syndrome and its presumed vector is now known to occur in other regions such as the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic States.</p><p>The putative causative agent of this disease, <em>Borrelia lonestari</em>, has never been isolated from a human with STARI, and Koch's postulates (criteria used to determine if a disease is caused by a specific microbe) have not yet been fulfilled in experimental studies. Nevertheless, STARI is widely presumed to be caused by <em>B. lonestari</em> and to be transmitted to humans by the Lone Star tick.</p><p>Numerous questions remain unanswered about the spectrum of clinical features and the pathophysiology of human illness following exposure to <em>B. lonestari</em>. In addition, the nature of its intermediate vertebrate host(s), the geographic range of illness, and the most effective treatment for STARI are unknown or incompletely understood.</p><p>At present, STARI should be considered to be a syndrome of unproven cause that is clinically diagnosed on the basis of its characteristic skin rash, mild clinical course, and occurrence in areas where Lyme disease is either uncommon or not present, but where <em>A. americanum</em> ticks are known to be present. Until there is a definitive diagnostic test for this illness and until the causative organism has been definitively isolated from humans, much of our understanding about epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment will remain speculative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSATIVE ORGANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are minimal data to suggest a specific microbial etiology for STARI. Studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing have led to the preliminary hypothesis that STARI is caused by a spirochete tentatively named <em>B. lonestari</em>. Initial descriptions of this organism were based on PCR amplification of the flagellin B gene and 16S rRNA from ticks collected from patients with STARI or from ticks that were collected in regions where STARI was recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>In 2001, a patient with typical features of STARI was identified who had an embedded <em>A. americanum</em> tick in the center of an EM-like skin lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Simultaneous PCR testing of a skin biopsy sample and the imbedded tick in two geographically separate laboratories yielded an identical amplification product. This PCR product had an identical sequence to PCR amplification products of the flagellin B gene and 16S rRNA recovered from Lone star ticks by other investigators in different locations where STARI was recognized. Attempts to culture <em>Borrelia</em> from a portion of the skin biopsy were unsuccessful and serial testing of the patient's serum failed to show evidence of infection with <em>B. burgdorferi</em>.</p><p>This is the only published report of finding PCR products typical of <em>B. lonestari</em> in a sample taken from a human. No other investigators have been able to duplicate this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p><em>Borrelia lonestari</em> has been grown in vitro from <em>A. americanum</em> ticks collected in Georgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Light and electron microscopic studies of this single isolate revealed that the organism is a spirochete that is morphologically similar but not identical to <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> sensu lato (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77675\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77675 \">picture 3</a>). <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu lato is a broad term that includes several closely related borrelial species that have been associated with Lyme disease; <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu stricto is the sole cause of Lyme disease in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This <em>Borrelia</em> isolate did not react with OspA antibody specific for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> or give positive results using indirect fluorescent antibody testing methods used for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> detection. In addition, PCR amplification of DNA from this tick isolate had an essentially identical sequence to amplification products of 16S rRNA made from Lone star ticks collected in different geographic locations and from blood samples from white-tailed deer killed in several southeastern states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/3-5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spirochetes resembling <em>Borrelia</em> spp have been visualized in Lone star ticks collected in Alabama, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. Molecular evidence that such spirochetes are <em>B. lonestari</em> has been reported by investigators studying <em>A. americanum</em> ticks collected from in the field, from deer, or from patients with STARI in Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas, and from a tick from a patient who had recently been in both North Carolina and Maryland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/3-5,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7,10</a>]. A single case of STARI has also been reported in a patient from Long Island, New York [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>All three stages of <em>A. americanum</em> feed on white-tailed deer. As a result, it is possible that these animals are one of the vertebrate reservoir hosts for <em>B. lonestari</em>. In addition, white-tailed deer and <em>A. americanum</em> have well-established interrelationships in the epidemiology of <em>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</em> and <em>Ehrlichia ewingii</em> infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-ehrlichiae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of ehrlichiae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study, 7 of 80 samples obtained from deer killed in 17 separate sites in Arkansas, Georgia, North and South Carolina had evidence of <em>B. lonestari</em> infection using PCR amplification for the <em>Borrelia</em> flagellin gene. Furthermore, the flagellin gene sequence amplified from deer blood was identical to the DNA sequences previously amplified from ticks collected in Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas and from the single human patient with STARI who had PCR products typical of B. lonestari [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p>In one study, inoculation of white-tailed deer with <em>B. lonestari</em> resulted in spirochetemia, as assessed with blood smears. These deer showed evidence of infection by PCR within four days of inoculation and subsequent PCR tests remained positive for up to 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Human illness with typical clinical features of STARI have been described in patients from Mississippi, Missouri, Maryland, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/6,14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14-18</a>]; in addition, a single case has been described in a patient who was bitten by a tick on Long Island [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If subsequent studies confirm that <em>B. lonestari</em> is the cause of STARI and white-tailed deer are the intermediate host, it is likely that human disease will be found to occur in other areas where both the tick and reservoir host are common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of STARI is currently based upon the presence of an erythema migrans-like rash following a history of tick bite that occurs in areas where the vector of Lyme disease is uncommon or unknown. As a result, it is possible that the clinical spectrum of STARI is broader than currently recognized.</p><p>The clinical spectrum of STARI was illustrated in a report of 14 patients seen over a two-year period in central North Carolina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All of the patients had a recent history of EM-like skin lesions after removing attached ticks, and eight remembered removing a tick from the exact site where the rash developed. The median time from tick detection to onset of rash was 12 days with a range of 2 to 21 days. In every case in which the tick was available for subsequent study, it was identified as <em>A. americanum</em>. The illness was mild in all cases; only one had fever and all recovered without sequelae.</p><p>Skin lesions in patients with STARI may be single or multiple. The lesions are characteristically erythematous with irregular borders and central clearing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60256\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60256 \">picture 4</a>). Some patients have a papule in the center of their EM-like lesions, many recall removing a tick at the exact site of this papule. The skin lesions may expand centrifugally over several days. At the time of diagnosis, the diameter of such lesions has ranged from 3 to 10 cm.</p><p>Patients with STARI often complain of headache, generalized aching, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nausea, but these symptoms as well as the rash disappear following treatment with tetracyclines. Thus far, no long-term complications or evidence of recurrence following treatment has been recognized.</p><p>In a prospective study, the clinical and epidemiologic features of 21 patients from Missouri with EM-like skin lesions were compared to 97 patients from New York with EM-like lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The two groups of patients had substantial and statistically significant clinical differences. Compared to patients from New York, patients from Missouri with EM-like skin lesions were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More likely to recall a recent tick bite (86 versus 20 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less likely to be symptomatic (19 versus 76 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less likely to have multiple skin lesions (5 versus 27 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More likely to have smaller lesions (mean size 8.3 cm versus 16.4 cm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More likely to have lesions with central clearing (76 versus 22 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More likely to recover rapidly after antibiotic treatment (at three-month follow-up visit 0 versus 21 percent with persistent symptoms)</p><p/><p>The authors of this report concluded that these differences were further evidence that STARI is a distinct and different illness than Lyme disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ELISA testing is equivocal or weakly positive for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> antibodies in some patients with STARI, Western blot patterns show profiles that are inconsistent with acute <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection. In addition, patients with STARI do not develop antibodies to rickettsial or ehrlichial antigens. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia do not occur and routine laboratory tests of renal and hepatic function are typically normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H853624137\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histologic findings in skin biopsies from patients with STARI are similar to the histologic findings from biopsies of erythema migrans (EM) lesions of patients with Lyme disease. Superficial and deep infiltrates with lymphocytes are present in both conditions. However, the skin lesions of patients with STARI lack plasma cells whereas plasma cells are often present in EM lesions of patients with Lyme disease. In addition, silver stains for the presence of spirochetes are characteristically negative in biopsies of skin lesions in patients with STARI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7615635\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At present, there is no serologic antibody test available to detect acute infection with <em>B. lonestari</em>. The diagnosis is a clinical one, based on compatible symptoms and physical examination findings in a person with a history of a tick bite from a known endemic area of the Lone Star tick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been no randomized controlled trials of treatment for patients with STARI. Patients described in most case series and case reports have responded promptly to therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>. Since the organism causing this disease appears to be a spirochete of the <em>Borrelia</em> family, some experts believe that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> in doses similar to treat erythema migrans of acute <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection is also likely to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Early disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Suggested approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients residing in or traveling to areas where Lyme disease is uncommon develop skin lesions typical of erythema migrans and when a history of a recent tick bite is either elicited or thought to be possible, a 10-day course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice daily) should be prescribed. Patients with a contraindication to using doxycycline can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> 500 mg orally three times a day for 10 days.</p><p>Follow-up serological testing for Lyme disease is not necessary in such patients since the preceding regimens are highly effective for both STARI and early Lyme disease and because early treatment of such patients may prevent antibody development, even in patients with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the full clinical spectrum of STARI will await better diagnostic methodology. When such testing is available, there may be an expansion in both the spectrum of clinical features and the geographic range of illness. As an example, <em>A. americanum</em> and white-tailed deer are known to exist throughout the eastern United States as far north as New England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Until there is a reliable laboratory method to diagnose STARI, it is likely that some patients with EM-like skin lesions due to STARI will be misdiagnosed as having Lyme disease if they reside in areas where the vectors of both illnesses coexist. This phenomenon may be partly responsible for the increase in the reported incidence of Lyme disease in North Carolina and other states where the vector of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The frequency that such diagnostic confusion occurs has not yet been studied, nor has the potential clinical and financial consequences of unnecessary testing and treatment for Lyme disease in patients with STARI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7615687\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the 1980s, clinicians in Missouri and the southeastern United States described a new illness characterized by the presence of a rash typical of erythema migrans (EM) and mild flu-like symptoms that was temporally associated with a bite by the Lone Star tick (<em>Amblyomma americanum</em>).
