In a cohort of patients who were less than 12 years of age when they received their transplants, children in whom allograft failure occurred within 10 years of transplant compared with those with continued allograft function 10 years post-transplant were more likely to be older, non-Caucasian, have had a history of focal glomerulosclerosis, and have received a deceased donor kidney, and were less likely to have obstructive uropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, for living donor recipients, the use and duration of pretransplant hemodialysis, but not pretransplant peritoneal dialysis, adversely affected renal allograft survival. Improved allograft survival of preemptive transplantation was also reported in several studies, including one from the NAPRTCS registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA matching and graft survival in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Identical HLA matches result in the best outcomes. However, children rarely have brothers or sisters (some of whom are HLA identical) old enough to be an organ donor; as a result, most living donated allografts are from a parent, who is an obligate one haplotype match. Optimal HLA matching is also preferred to minimize sensitization, particularly for young recipients who will need retransplantations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].

Restricting deceased donor offers to only well HLA-matched donors may significantly prolong the transplant candidate's wait time, increasing morbidities associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and dialysis. In addition, improved matching may not prolong long-term graft survival, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis from the OPTN database, there was no significant five-year allograft survival advantage based on HLA-DR matching for primary pediatric renal recipients who received deceased donor allografts between 1996 and 2004 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the International Collaborative Transplant Study database of 9209 pediatric renal transplant recipients also showed that two HLA-DR mismatches compared with zero and one mismatches were not associated with significantly lower allograft survival in deceased donor transplants performed during 1998 to 2007, although they were associated with poorer allograft survival in the previous 10-year time period between 1988 and 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, increasing numbers of combined HLA-A+B+DR mismatches correlated with poorer allograft survival during both time periods.</p><p/><p>In contrast, a single-center study that determined HLA-DR sensitization post-transplantation found that HLA-DR mismatching increased the risk of rejection in 178 patients (below 21 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. At a median follow-up of 4.1 years, patients with one or two mismatches had a 1.7 times greater chance of rejection than those patients without a mismatch. In addition, the study also reported that the probability of finding a zero mismatched ABO-identical donor was low. These results highlight the tension between the waiting time required to perform HLA matching that negatively impacts allograft function and the benefit of finding a donor allograft without any mismatches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Recipient age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of kidney transplantation in children appear to vary with the age of the recipient.
