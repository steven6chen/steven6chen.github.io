At least two-thirds of melanoma in light-skinned populations worldwide may be attributed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure from both natural and artificial sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Based upon this and other data implicating UV light as a risk factor for melanoma, reducing exposure to UV radiation has been advocated as a method to reduce the incidence of this malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The observed decline by approximately 5 percent per year in the incidence of invasive melanoma in the state of Queensland, Australia, among men and women aged 15 to 24 years in the period of 2006 through 2010 may be the result of sun awareness campaigns implemented in Australia on a national scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Interventions that may be relevant to the primary prevention of melanoma will be reviewed here.

Two different epigenetic pathways that can result in cutaneous melanoma are suggested by epidemiologic population-based data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Individuals with an inherently low propensity for melanocyte proliferation may require chronic sun exposure to drive clonal expansion. In contrast, those with a high propensity for melanocyte proliferation (characterized by high nevus count) may require less solar exposure to stimulate carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

This may be related to an effort by the body to continue to produce melanin, which has a photoprotective function in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The result, however, is that severely damaged melanocytes that are at risk for incomplete DNA repair and subsequent mutation are preserved. UVB radiation (290 to 320 nm) causes the majority of DNA damage in the epidermis. However, UVA may also be important in the pathogenesis of melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In contrast to nonmelanoma skin cancers (particularly squamous cell carcinoma), which are associated with cumulative sun exposure and occur most frequently in areas maximally exposed to the sun (ie, the face, back of hands, and forearms), most melanomas are associated with intense intermittent sun exposure and tend to occur in areas exposed to the sun sporadically (eg, the back in men and women and lower legs in women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>Exposure in childhood seems particularly important; a history of five or more severe sunburns in adolescence more than doubles the risk of developing melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Furthermore, the incidence of melanoma is increased among people who migrated from northern to more equatorial latitudes, but only among immigrants who were children at the time of migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

Data from a follow-up study of a community-based, randomized trial in Queensland, Australia, published after the systematic review, support the use of sunscreen products, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>In the Australian trial, 1621 participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (unlimited supply of sun protection factor [SPF] 16 sunscreen provided and participants instructed to engage in daily sunscreen use) or a discretionary sunscreen group (participants used their own sunscreen at their own discretion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Ten years after the conclusion of the four-year trial, participants in the intervention group had developed 50 percent fewer primary melanomas compared to the control group (11 versus 22 melanomas; hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; 95% CI 0.24-1.02). The reduction was even greater for invasive melanomas: 3 melanomas occurred in the intervention group versus 11 in the control group (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08-0.97), corresponding to a risk reduction of 73 percent. This study provides strong evidence that the regular use of sunscreen reduces the incidence of melanoma. In addition, in the same trial the rates of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) were decreased by nearly 40 percent during the entire follow-up period (rate ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.38-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Individuals at increased risk of melanoma and individuals highly exposed to sunlight should apply a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher daily and thoroughly before going out.

Examples of data on the use of sun protection include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1998 and 2004, cross-sectional surveys of youth aged 11 to 18 years in the United States were conducted (n = 1196 and n = 1613, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In 2004, 69 percent of subjects reported having been sunburned during the summer, not significantly less than in 1998 (72 percent). However, the youngest children reported a significant decrease in sunburns. Sunscreen use, the most common form of sun protection, increased significantly while other sun protection measures did not change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 28,000 adults participated in the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and were asked questions regarding sun-protection behaviors and sunburns in the past year.

A 2010 analysis of the NHIS data on nearly 25,000 adult Americans found an overall sunburn rate of 37 percent in the past year, with highest rates among youngest adults of 18 to 29 years (52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Parents are more likely to protect their children than themselves, although they often do not provide adequate protection for their children. One randomized trial that investigated the impact of parent education on sun protection for children found that taken together, 22 and 54 percent of children in the intervention and control groups received a sunburn or tan during their first and second summers of life, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Young teens&rsquo; practice of sun protection tends to modestly decrease as peer pressure and fashion concerns start to influence their behavior.

Based upon these findings, the working group concluded that minors and young adults should avoid the use of tanning devices and supported restricting access to artificial tanning facilities for individuals under the age of 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>A population-based case-control study including 681 patients with melanoma and 654 matched controls younger than 50 years found that women who had ever tanned indoors had a two- to sixfold increased risk of melanoma compared with women who had never tanned indoors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In all age groups, the risk was consistently increased for women who started tanning indoors before age 25 years and for those who reported &gt;10 lifetime tanning sessions. </p><p>In Europe, individuals under the age of 18 years are banned from using tanning beds in France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Lithuania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In Canada, tanning beds are banned under the age of 18 in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia, and under the age of 19 in Nova Scotia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In 2008, a joint Australian and New Zealand solarium standard bans the use of sun tanning units for persons under 18 years and for all persons with skin type I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. From January 2015, tanning beds have been banned in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. A similar ban was introduced in Brazil in 2009. </p><p>In the United States, indoor tanning is banned for those under 18 in 14 states (California, Vermont, Nevada, Texas, Oregon, Illinois, Washington, Minnesota, Hawaii, Louisiana, Delaware, North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts) and the District of Columbia; in many other states, parental permission is required for minors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In May 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an order requiring that sunlamp products used in tanning salons carry a visible boxed warning that states that sunlamp products should not be used on persons under the age of 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In December 2015, the FDA proposed a new rule to ban indoor tanning for those under age 18 nationwide as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Increased risk for melanoma has also been detected in patients who begin tanning in mid-adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Based upon evidence implicating tanning bed use as a risk factor for melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/52,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,61-63</a>], the recreational use of tanning devices should be avoided. However, tanning bed users have reported relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>], and improved mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>] as motivation for continuing this practice, and there is increasing evidence that biochemical addiction to tanning can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].</p><p>The mechanism for an addiction to tanning is unconfirmed. It has been proposed that ultraviolet (UV)-induced production of pro-opiomelanocortin products including beta endorphins may be a contributing factor. This theory was supported by the findings of a small randomized trial in which opioid blockade with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> was associated with a reduced preference of UV exposure among frequent tanners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Administration of naltrexone also led to withdrawal symptoms in four out of eight frequent tanners, while no infrequent tanners experienced withdrawal-like symptoms. However, the relationship between tanning bed exposure and opioid production remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>If a true entity, addiction to tanning may be common. In one study of college students, 90 out of 229 students who reported tanning bed use (39 percent) met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV-TR criteria for addiction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Tanning bed addiction may be more common in individuals with anxiety, depressive symptoms, or substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/70,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,73</a>].</p><p>Further studies are necessary to determine the relationship between tanning and psychiatric disorders and the best approach to patients who exhibit signs of a tanning addiction. In the interim, clinicians should remain cognizant that psychological factors may play a role in the reluctance or inability of some patients to stop tanning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49280705\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMOPREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemoprevention or therapeutic prevention is defined as the use of natural or synthetic agents to delay, reverse, suppress, or prevent premalignant lesions from progressing to invasive cancer and has been evaluated in melanoma and other skin cancers as a means of primary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. Various phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals, and antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and targeted agents are being studied, though none has been proven to prevent melanoma in clinical trials to date. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H932772\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sun exposure is necessary for the synthesis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the skin. This intermediate metabolite is transformed to its biologically active form under conditions of physiological demand for calcium and phosphorus. The potential health benefits of vitamin D continue to be explored as the incidence and survival of major internal cancers is known to improve significantly with decreasing latitudes in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of active vitamin D (ie, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) may be a factor in the association of vitamin D with lower risk for some malignancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-prevention#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer prevention&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p>An effect of vitamin D on melanoma pathogenesis was suggested by a case control study of 500 melanoma patients, in which sun exposure, as measured by solar elastosis, was associated with increased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. However, serum vitamin D levels were not assessed in this study, and vitamin D levels are unlikely to be the only reason for this observation, particularly given our growing understanding of &quot;diverging&quot; melanoma pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

An earlier case-control study found no association of melanoma risk with total vitamin D intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>At least two studies of dietary vitamin D and melanoma risk have resulted in other conclusions. A case-control study of more than 1000 subjects identified a significant reduction of melanoma risk for individuals with high vitamin D intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Conversely, a large prospective study reported an increased risk of melanoma associated with cod liver oil intake (a source of vitamin D) among women, but not men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the overall incidence of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.64-1.16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. However, in a subgroup analysis of participants who reported a history of NMSC, women in the vitamin D and calcium group had 57 percent fewer melanomas than women in the placebo group (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.90). This finding suggests a role for either vitamin D or calcium, or their combination in reducing the incidence of melanoma in a high-risk group of postmenopausal women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22125985\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) have been suggested as having chemopreventive effects against melanoma. However, observational studies of different medications and in different populations have provided inconsistent evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Several case-control studies have found a protective effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and other NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>]. The melanoma risk reduction ranged from 13 to 50 percent, depending upon the frequency and duration of use.

A reduced risk of melanoma among ASA users was also observed in the WHI Observational Study, a large cohort study including 59,806 postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In this study, the risk of melanoma was 21 percent lower in women using acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) than in nonusers (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In contrast, another large cohort study including 63,809 men and women did not find any association between NSAID use and melanoma risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22125958\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid lowering agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins and fibrates, have been evaluated.

The media is another outlet for increasing awareness of sun protection; some television stations and newspapers notify the public of days on which the risk of high UV exposure is elevated. However, no studies have directly linked the implementation of public health programs to a reduction in melanoma incidence. </p><p>Clinician efforts to educate patients on protection from ultraviolet (UV) light exposure may influence patient behavior. A systematic review performed for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found that patient counseling with tailored feedback in the primary care setting was associated with modest improvement in sun protective practices and reduced indoor tanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The USPSTF recommends counseling children, adolescents, and young adults aged 10 to 24 years who have fair skin about minimizing their exposure to UV radiation to reduce the risk of skin cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-melanoma/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].
