Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was traditionally considered an <strong>absolute</strong> contraindication for transplantation because of the concern that immunosuppression would accelerate HIV disease progression, resulting in increased mortality and a &quot;waste&quot; of organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Since potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) became widely available in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the prognosis of patients with HIV infection has dramatically improved. There have been significant decreases in morbidity and mortality, and, for many individuals with well-controlled viral replication, HIV is now a chronic, manageable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Improvements in the long-term prognosis of those with HIV infection and studies demonstrating good outcomes with kidney transplantation have prompted many transplant programs to reevaluate their policies regarding the exclusion of patients with HIV infection. A review of the issues surrounding kidney transplantation in HIV-infected patients is presented here.</p><p>An overview of kidney disease in HIV-infected patients and a discussion of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) are presented elsewhere.

In many patients, HIV infection was only diagnosed retrospectively or acquired peritransplant by transfusion or transplantation with infected organs. The improvement in patient survival with ART called into question the previous policy of systematically denying transplantation to HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4105279010\"><span class=\"h3\">Transplantation in the ART era</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>] have demonstrated comparable patient and graft outcomes between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients who underwent kidney transplantation after the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/7,8,10-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10-19</a>]. As an example, a large, prospective, nonrandomized trial examined outcomes of kidney transplantation in 150 HIV-infected recipients with CD4 counts of &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and undetectable HIV RNA levels between November 2003 and June 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patient survival at one and three years was 95 and 88 percent, respectively; allograft survival was 90 and 74 percent, respectively. These survival rates fell in between those for recipients older than 65 years of age and those for all kidney transplant recipients, as reported by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR).</p><p>However, outcomes appear to be poorer among transplant recipients who are coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) data that compared outcomes for 492 HIV-infected recipients and 147 <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-coinfected</span> recipients, there was no significant difference in patient or allograft survival between HIV-monoinfected recipients and an uninfected reference group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.26, 95% CI 1.45-3.52) and graft loss (HR 2.59, 95% CI 1.60-4.19) was observed in the <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-coinfected</span> cohort.</p><p>The impact of new therapies for HCV on posttransplant outcomes for coinfected patients has yet to be determined. A discussion of kidney transplant in HCV-infected patients is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C infection in kidney transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal transplantation has been associated with a survival benefit over chronic dialysis. In a study of 1431 HIV-infected kidney transplant candidates, the risk of mortality at five years was significantly lower among those who underwent renal transplant compared with those who remained on dialysis (adjust relative risk [aRR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.10-0.42), and a survival benefit was achieved at 194 days posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among patients coinfected with HCV, renal transplant was also associated with a lower risk of death compared with dialysis, although the survival benefit was not achieved until 392 days posttransplant. While kidney transplantation has become more common among HIV-infected patients, the burden of ESRD remains high among HIV-infected individuals despite ART, and they are less likely to achieve transplantation than their uninfected counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3494508754\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-infected renal transplant recipients have a high frequency of rejection. In a large, multicenter trial, one- and three-year rejection rates were 31 and 41 percent, respectively, compared with an expected one-year rejection rate of 12 percent, as reported by SRTR for all kidney transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At European transplant centers, where most patients are induced with interleukin (IL)-2 receptor antibodies, one-year, acute rejection rates among HIV-infected recipients have ranged from 15 to 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>The higher rate of rejection in HIV-infected recipients is likely multifactorial. Drug-drug interactions between calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) can lead to subtherapeutic exposure to immunosuppressive agents. Patients on a CNI and PI require nonstandard dosing schedules (ie, every other or every third day), which can make patient adherence difficult. Furthermore, concomitant administration of a PI and CNI results in a 40 percent lower area under the curve (AUC) for CNI exposure at the same CNI target level, leading clinicians to systematically underdose patients taking both medications. In light of these challenges, many transplant professionals seek to transition patients off PI-based regimens whenever possible in favor of integrase inhibitor-based regimens, which avoid these drug-drug interactions and permit standard immunosuppression dosing (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv#H1322359788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;, section on 'Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)'</a>). Additionally, given concerns about overimmunosuppression, many HIV-infected patients are given IL-2 receptor antibody induction rather than lymphocyte-depleting agents, and this may also increase their acute rejection risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults#H773978634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'HIV-infected patients'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4290068935\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney transplant patients are at increased risk for the development of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In one large, multicenter trial of 150 HIV-infected transplant recipients, only 13 (8.7 percent) developed cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The most common malignancy was skin cancer, and in 3.5 years of follow-up, there were three cancer-related deaths.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4228624703\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonopportunistic infections are common in HIV-infected renal transplant recipients and mirror the trend seen in HIV-negative kidney transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In one study, one-half of recipients were hospitalized within the first six months posttransplant for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. HCV coinfection and induction with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) increased the risk of posttransplant infection. The most common etiologies were bacterial infections of the blood, urinary system, or respiratory tract. Another study using SRTR data linked to Medicare claims found no difference in posttransplant infection rates between different types of induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1991137614\"><span class=\"h1\">ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney transplantation is now accepted as &quot;standard of care&quot; for HIV-positive patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD); however, the majority of these transplants continue to be performed at large, academic medical centers with robust transplant infectious disease support.</p><p>HIV-infected renal transplant candidates must meet center-specific, general transplant candidate selection criteria in addition to HIV-specific criteria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>). There are no established HIV-specific selection criteria for recipients, but most centers follow the patient selection criteria set forth in a National Institutes of Health (NIH) multicenter trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], which specified that patients must have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count of &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> on a stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for at least six months. Opportunistic infections (OIs) are no longer a cause for exclusion, but patients with a history of Kaposi sarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy should be considered on a case-by-case basis and may not be considered candidates at many centers. Patients who are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) require hepatology evaluation and an assessment of liver fibrosis.

However, improvements in the long-term prognosis of those with HIV infection and studies demonstrating good outcomes with kidney transplantation have prompted many transplant programs to reevaluate their policies regarding the exclusion of patients with HIV infection.

However, outcomes appear to be poorer among transplant recipients who are coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition, HIV-infected transplant recipients are at an increased risk of rejection and malignancy posttransplant.

HIV-infected renal transplant candidates must meet center-specific, general transplant candidate-selection criteria in addition to HIV-specific criteria. There are no established HIV-specific selection criteria for recipients, but most centers follow the patient-selection criteria set forth in a National Institutes of Health (NIH) multicenter trial, which specified that patients must have a viral load below the limit of detection (typically &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> and a CD4 count of &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> on a stable ART regimen for at least six months. Opportunistic infections (OIs) are no longer a cause for exclusion, but patients with a history of Kaposi sarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy should be considered on a case-by-case basis and may not be considered candidates at many centers. Patients who are coinfected with HCV or hepatitis B virus (HBV) require hepatology evaluation and an assessment of liver fibrosis.
