(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and laboratory manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>However, in a small minority of patients, the characteristic prodrome of diarrhea is absent. In this setting, the presence of the defining triad in an age appropriate child should prompt consideration of infection of other organs, particularly the urinary tract, with a Shiga toxin-producing organism. The diagnosis is confirmed with serologic testing or a positive microbial culture for STEC. (See <a href=\"#H29383692\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of STEC infection'</a> above.)</p><p>In most patients, treatment is initiated because of the clinical diagnosis of HUS based on the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with fragmented red blood cells, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Renal biopsy, which is rarely performed, may be helpful in selected patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain and thrombocytopenia is not limiting. In general, patients with STEC-associated HUS will have renal parenchymal findings of glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy. In contrast, other causes of HUS (eg, complement-mediated HUS) will typically have a predominant arterial thrombotic microangiopathy pattern.

With severe diarrhea, elevations in the serum creatinine concentration and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are typically due to volume depletion, not intrinsic renal disease. Thus, the combination of severe diarrhea and renal insufficiency due to volume depletion may be confused with that due to HUS. This constellation of findings in the <strong>absence</strong> of thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia distinguishes these enteric infections from HUS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal injury can also occur in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and other forms of HUS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The distinction between HUS and DIC is more difficult, and is based upon the history and laboratory studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. DIC is associated with intravascular activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to intravascular deposition of fibrin thrombi, the consumption of all of the components of this cascade, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. As a result, patients with DIC typically have thrombocytopenia, low circulating levels of fibrinogen and factors V and VIII, and prolongation of the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times (PT and aPTT, respectively), which is not generally seen in patients with HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Furthermore, the alternative complement pathway may be transiently activated during the acute phase of STEC HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>] and STEC can trigger HUS episodes in patients with complement mutation, mostly in those with membrane cofactor protein (MCP) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].
