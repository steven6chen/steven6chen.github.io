The supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves are sensory nerves that innervate the forehead and upper eyelids. They are derived from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). The zygomaticotemporal nerve comes from the maxillary division (V2) and supplies a small area lateral to the outer canthus of the eye. The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division (V3) and provides sensation to the area in front of and above the ear. The greater occipital nerve comes from the dorsal ramus of C2 and ascends through the posterior scalp medial to the occipital artery. The lesser occipital nerve originates from the ventral rami of C2 and C3 and courses upward from the posterior neck to innervate the scalp behind the ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70877 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520467248\"><span class=\"h2\">Scalp block technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Six nerves are blocked on each side for complete scalp block.

Insert the needle 0.5 to 1 cm deep, perpendicular to the skin, until bone is contacted. Withdraw the needle slightly, and after negative aspiration, inject 3 mL of LA to block the supraorbital nerve. Redirect the needle medially under the skin, advance approximately 1 cm, and after negative aspiration, inject 2 to 3 mL of LA to block the supratrochlear nerve.

Facial nerve block should be self-limited and should resolve as the scalp block wears off, but it may complicate assessment of facial nerve trauma related to surgery. The incidence of facial nerve block may be reduced by minimizing the volume of LA injected for auriculotemporal block and by performing the block as described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520467260\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL PLEXUS BLOCKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superficial and deep cervical plexus blocks are the peripheral nerve blocks used for neck surgery. An intermediate cervical plexus block has also been described. These blocks can be used as primary anesthetics for carotid endarterectomy, where neurologic monitoring of an awake patient may identify cerebral thromboembolic or ischemic events. In this setting, coverage from a cervical plexus block may be variable and may require supplemental local anesthetic (LA) infiltration by the surgeon.

The anterior rami of C2 through C4 emerge from the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106135\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106135 \">figure 5</a>). There are four cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus, all of which are derived from C2 to C4. They are the lesser occipital nerve, the greater auricular nerve, the transverse cervical nerve, and the supraclavicular nerve. The cervical plexus supplies the skin of the anterolateral neck and posterolateral scalp, the skin around the ear, and the muscles of the neck, including the scalenes and strap muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106222 \">figure 6</a>). The cervical plexus also innervates the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve (C3, C4, C5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Cervical plexus blocks are defined by injections relative to the two layers of the deep cervical fascia (ie, the superficial, or investing, layer and the deep layer). A superficial cervical plexus block is injected superficial to the investing layer, and the intermediate block is injected between these two layers, and the deep block is injected below the deep layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108480374\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical plexus block techniques</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superficial cervical plexus block technique</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Superficial cervical plexus block is easy to master, is associated with few complications, and does not usually require ultrasound guidance. Nevertheless, we prefer ultrasound guidance because it can provide more precise deposition of LA in the posterior fascial plane of the SCM with visualization of the needle through the SCM. Ultrasound also allows identification of central vessels, allows navigation away from more superficial vessels (eg, external jugular vein), and avoids LA spread into the interscalene nerve plexus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patient is positioned supine, with the head slightly away from the side to be blocked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ultrasound guidance</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound guidance can be used, with the following technique:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Place a small, linear ultrasound probe in transverse orientation at the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, midway between the mastoid process and the C6 transverse process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53917 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106516\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106516 \">picture 1</a>). Visualize the posterior fascia of the SCM muscle. The cervical plexus, when it can be seen, may be visualized as a collection of small hypoechoic (black) ovals, immediately deep or lateral to the posterior border of the SCM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Insert the needle in plane to the transducer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97801 \">picture 2</a>) and advance until the tip is adjacent to the nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107807\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107807 \">image 1</a>). After negative aspiration, inject 10 mL of LA in 5-mL increments, with gentle aspiration between injections. If the plexus is not visualized, place the needle tip in the plane between the posterior fascia of the SCM and the prevertebral fascia below. Inject 10 mL of LA as the needle is advanced, with intermittent aspiration. LA should be visualized spreading in the fascial plane.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Anatomic technique </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Draw a line from the mastoid process to the C6 transverse process (ie, the Chassaignac tubercle) along the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53917 \">figure 7</a>). Insert the needle at the midpoint of this line. After negative aspiration, inject 10 to 15 mL of LA in 5-mL increments along the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, fanning the injection 2 to 3 cm above and below the needle insertion site, with gentle aspiration between injections. Injection deeper than 2 cm should be avoided to reduce injury to deep vessels and nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deep cervical plexus block technique</strong> &ndash; The deep cervical plexus block is essentially a cervical paravertebral block with anatomy and complications similar to paravertebral blocks in the thoracic and abdominal regions. (See <a href=\"#H318377508\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic paravertebral block'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques#H1413150725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Lumbar plexus (psoas compartment) block'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The landmark-based deep cervical plexus block is performed at the level of C6, which is known as the Chassaignac tubercle. When ultrasound guidance is used, LA can be deposited precisely in a more cephalad location, in the paravertebral spaces at the transverse processes of C2 to C4, while avoiding vascular and neuraxial complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patient is positioned supine, with the head slightly away from the side to be blocked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ultrasound guidance</strong> &ndash; We believe that deep cervical plexus block should be performed with ultrasound guidance. The following technique is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Place a small, linear ultrasound probe in transverse orientation just below the mastoid process. Scan caudally in a line between the mastoid process and the C6 transverse process. Visualize the loop of the vertebral artery to avoid vascular puncture. The transverse process of C2 is about 1 cm caudal to the loop or in the vicinity of the artery and should be identified by a hyperechoic bony structure with a large, dark drop-off shadow deep to the bone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Insert the needle in plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97801 \">picture 2</a>) to the transducer in an anterior-to-posterior orientation and advance until the tip contacts the superficial tip of the transverse process of the C2 vertebra. After negative aspiration, inject 5 mL of LA. LA should be visualized spreading adjacent to the transverse process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Scan caudally to the transverse processes of C3 and C4, and repeat injections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Anatomic technique</strong> &ndash; Where ultrasound is unavailable, the following landmark-based approach can be used:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Draw a line from the cricoid cartilage to the posterior border of the SCM. Palpate the bony C6 transverse process (ie, the Chassaignac tubercle) at this point by applying digital pressure in a posteromedial direction. Insert the needle in a posteromedial and inferior orientation until the transverse process is contacted at 1 to 2 cm. After negative aspiration, inject 15 to 20 mL of LA in 5-mL increments, with frequent aspiration. Avoid fanning and injection deeper than 2 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53917 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intermediate cervical plexus block technique</strong> &ndash; The intermediate cervical plexus block consists of a slightly more posterior superficial cervical block at C4. LA is deposited between the superficial and deep cervical fascia in the posterior triangle of the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This block is performed using ultrasound guidance as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place a small, linear ultrasound probe in transverse orientation in the posterior triangle of the neck at the level of the transverse process of C4. Insert the needle in plane to the transducer in an anterior-to-posterior orientation through the SCM and past the prevertebral fascia. The posterior cervical space is bounded by prevertebral fascia superficially, deep cervical paravertebral fascia medially, middle scalene or levator scapulae muscles posteriorly, and longus capitis or anterior scalene muscles anteriorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After negative aspiration, inject 15 mL of LA in 5-mL increments, with gentle aspiration between injections.

With deep block, potential complications include intravascular injection of LA, respiratory compromise with diaphragmatic or vocal cord paralysis, and, very rarely, intrathecal injection of LA. A systematic review of complications of superficial and deep cervical plexus blocks reported that conversion to general anesthesia was more common with deep blocks (odds ratio [OR] 5.15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The corresponding nerve associated with T12 is the subcostal nerve. The first six intercostal nerves are called the thoracic intercostal nerves.

We perform intercostal block with ultrasound guidance to minimize the chance of intravascular injection and pneumothorax and to increase reliable dermatomal coverage. The injection can be made closer to the vertebral column (and more proximal in the course of the nerve) with ultrasound guidance because palpation of the rib is less important than with an anatomic landmark approach. Therefore, with ultrasound, the injection more reliably blocks the nerve prior to its division into the lateral and anterior branches, increasing the likelihood of full dermatomal anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81512 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>The patient is placed in the lateral, prone, or sitting position.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound guidance</strong> &ndash; When possible, the patient is positioned prone, with the arms resting above the head (to rotate the scapula) and a pillow under the abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105087\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105087 \">picture 3</a>).

A total of 12 nerves (six on each side) are blocked to achieve a complete scalp block. (See <a href=\"#H520467515\" class=\"local\">'Scalp block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical plexus blocks anesthetize the anterior and lateral neck and scalp. They can provide intraoperative anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery in the neck and are particularly useful for carotid endarterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H520467260\" class=\"local\">'Cervical plexus blocks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic and thoracoabdominal intercostal nerves can be blocked individually to provide anesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesia for thoracic and upper abdominal surgical procedures (eg, thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopy, chest tube placement, breast surgery, rib fractures, and upper abdominal procedures). Each intercostal block achieves a band-like segment of anesthesia at the chosen level. This block is easy to perform, though multiple blocks are often required. (See <a href=\"#H318377196\" class=\"local\">'Intercostal nerve block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is a compartment block used most commonly to provide anesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesia for mastectomy and cosmetic breast surgery, thoracic surgery, nephrectomy, and rib fractures. Compared with epidural blockade, TPVB offers the possibility of unilateral block. (See <a href=\"#H318377508\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic paravertebral block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thoracic interfascial plane blocks include the Pecs I, Pecs II, and serratus plane (SP) blocks. These blocks can be used in combination and with other blocks for superficial and deep surgery in the pectoral and axillary regions (eg, mastectomy, cosmetic breast surgery, chest tube placement, multiple rib fractures). (See <a href=\"#H520467320\" class=\"local\">'Pecs I block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H520467326\" class=\"local\">'Pecs II block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H520467332\" class=\"local\">'Serratus plane block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block, subcostal TAP block, and ilioinguinal (II) and iliohypogastric (IH) nerve blocks are abdominal blocks performed by injection of local anesthetic (LA) into the TAP to anesthetize nerves as they traverse the space. They are used for analgesia for open and laparoscopic abdominal surgery. (See <a href=\"#H520467453\" class=\"local\">'Transversus abdominis plane block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H520467459\" class=\"local\">'Subcostal transversus abdominis plane block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H520467471\" class=\"local\">'Ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rectus sheath block is performed by injection of LA between the body of the rectus muscle and its posterior sheath. It is used for midline, periumbilical surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1153257867\" class=\"local\">'Rectus sheath block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transversalis fascia plane block is performed by injection of LA between the transversalis fascia and the quadratus lumborum muscle. It is particularly useful for analgesia after iliac crest bone graft harvest.
