Isavuconazole was also better tolerated by patients and exhibited an improved safety profile. However, only three patients with <em>Scedosporium</em> infection participated, thus precluding conclusions about efficacy for these infections. Individualized care of the patient with <em>Scedosporium</em>, including susceptibility testing of the isolate along with infectious disease consultation and careful monitoring, is crucial for managing these complex infections.</p><p>Although amphotericin B has been used to treat <em>Scedosporium</em> infection, a retrospective analysis of patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a> for invasive fungal infections showed very poor response rates in patients who were infected with <em>Scedosporium</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-scedosporium-and-lomentospora-infections/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The fungus is generally resistant to most available antifungals, but it still may be helpful to check in vitro susceptibilities to judge relative activities of antifungal agents against the specific strain.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> appears to have some activity against this organism, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) tend to be high, and the response to therapy varies depending on the site and extent of infection and the underlying immune status of the host. Patients with <em>L. prolificans</em> infection who are not severely immunocompromised and have skin and soft tissue or bone infection have better outcomes with voriconazole than patients with severe immunosuppression (eg, cancer, hematopoietic cell transplantation) or those with respiratory, central nervous system, or disseminated disease.</p><p>Given the aggressive and often fatal nature of infections with <em>L. prolificans</em>, management needs to be tailored to the individual patient. Surgical debridement and optimization of the patient's immune status (eg, reducing immunosuppression when feasible) are key elements that play a role in determining outcome. Some experts give combination antifungal therapy with an extended-spectrum azole (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> or an echinocandin or both. We typically give voriconazole plus terbinafine with or without an echinocandin. The antifungal regimen should be tailored according to in vitro susceptibility results when they become available. In cases for which susceptibility testing reveals no good antifungal options, antifungal agents are maintained while management of the infection and underlying condition are reevaluated. While an optimal outcome is desired, not all of these cases will achieve a successful result.</p><p>Mortality rates with <em>L. prolificans</em> infection are high due to resistance to available antifungal agents. A retrospective review showed successful responses to therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> in 16 of 36 patients (44 percent) infected with <em>L. prolificans </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-scedosporium-and-lomentospora-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
