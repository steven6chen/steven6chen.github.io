These injuries include hemotympanum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387 \">picture 1</a>), hearing loss, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, otic capsule injury, and traumatic perilymphatic fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>Otic capsule injury is four to five times more likely if temporal bone fracture occurs with facial nerve paralysis, CSF otorrhea, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Middle ear injury may also occur after direct blunt trauma to the external auditory canal (eg, hand blow to ear [&quot;boxed ears&quot;], fall onto the ear while water or snow skiing, motor vehicle collision, sports injury [eg, wrestling]) or penetrating trauma (eg, Q-tip, matchstick injury, gunshot wound, welding or soldering spark) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/3,4,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6-11</a>].</p><p>Barotrauma with middle ear injury can occur during air travel, scuba diving, or exposure to a blast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-barotrauma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ear barotrauma&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Middle ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The middle ear space is an air-filled cavity between the external ear canal and the inner ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75010 \">figure 1</a>). The ossicular chain and the facial nerve cross the middle ear space. The boundaries of the middle ear cavity are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tympanic membrane (TM), a three-layered membrane, laterally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The otic capsule, containing the cochlea and vestibule, medially</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bony tegmental wall under the middle cranial fossa, superiorly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bony jugular wall, encasing the internal jugular vein bulb, inferiorly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The carotid wall, containing the Eustachian tube and tensor tympani muscle, anteriorly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The entrance to the mastoid cavity, called the aditus ad antrum, posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74487 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p>The posterior aspect of the middle ear space leads into the adjacent air space called the mastoid cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74487 \">figure 2</a>). The bony roof of these regions separates them from the middle cranial fossa, which is lined by dura; the bony posterior aspect of the mastoid cavity contains the sigmoid sinus in the posterior cranial fossa. Fractures of the temporal bone into these spaces may result in any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF middle ear effusion, otorrhea, or rhinorrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemotympanum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid artery aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis days to years after the injury</p><p/><p>The middle ear space is lined by vascularized mucosa. The pressure in the middle ear cavity is equilibrated to ambient pressure by the action of the tensor veli palatini muscle and the salpingopharyngeus muscle located at the orifice of the Eustachian tube (ET). The ET is supported by cartilage and lined by mucosa as it travels from the middle ear space into the nasopharynx.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ossicles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ossicles (the malleus, the incus, and the stapes) comprise a lever system that amplifies sound by a factor of approximately 1.5. The tympanic membrane (TM) has a large surface area compared with the oval window of the inner ear, and thus, it is responsible for amplification of sound by a factor of approximately 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Sudden changes in sound intensity can be temporized by the activity of the stapedius muscle and tensor tympani muscle, both of which contract reflexively to dampen sound. Absence of air in the middle ear space, loss of TM integrity or disruption of the ossicular chain compromises the amplification system.</p><p>Middle ear injuries, such as those sustained from a slap on the ear or insertion of a Q-tip, may result in mild conductive hearing loss due to TM perforation with partial loss of sound amplification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65160\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65160 \">picture 2</a>). Hemotympanum or CSF middle ear effusion caused by temporal bone basilar skull fracture or barotrauma may also dampen TM sound conduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-barotrauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ear barotrauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Middle ear injuries, such as more severe ear canal foreign body penetrations or temporal bone fractures, may result in maximum conductive hearing loss (ie, 60 dB) if the ossicular leverage system is disrupted at the incudostapedial joint or if the stapes is subluxed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57714\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57714 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Alternatively, such injuries can result in sensorineural hearing loss as a result of a cochlear concussion, otic capsule fracture, or internal auditory canal fracture with impingement of the acoustic nerve (cranial nerve VIII).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjacent structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following structures are present within <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjacent to the middle ear and often sustain injury when middle ear trauma occurs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oval window</strong> &ndash; Sudden changes in pressure, associated with barometric pressure changes, sound waves, or direct cranial injury, may result in trauma to the oval window and may cause a perilymphatic fistula between the inner ear and middle ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75010 \">figure 1</a>). The presence of a perilymphatic fistula is associated with hearing loss and &quot;third window&quot; signs, such as Tullio phenomenon and a positive fistula test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], which are manifest as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/5,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14-16</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In Tullio phenomenon, a loud sound presented to the affected ear causes spinning vertigo and nystagmus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The fistula test is positive when pneumatic otoscopy with positive and negative pressure in the ear canal on the intact tympanic membrane results in spinning vertigo and nystagmus. If movements are large, the semicircular canal may be compromised; if movements are minimal, it may be an oval window fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inner ear (otic capsule)</strong> &ndash; The inner ear is encased by the bony otic capsule and contains the cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular canals. The bone of the otic capsule is denser than the surrounding petrous portion of the temporal bone. When the otic capsule is fractured, damage to the cochlea with permanent sensorineural hearing loss usually occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facial nerve</strong> &ndash; Usually encased in thin bone, the facial nerve exits the internal auditory canal, crosses the middle ear just superior to the oval window and stapes footplate, and then enters the fallopian canal to exit the mastoid via the stylomastoid foramen. From there, it divides into the branches responsible for activity of the muscles of facial expression. During its temporal bone course, the chorda tympani branch &quot;leaves&quot; the facial nerve to carry special sensory afferent fibers for taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Injury to the facial nerve results in ipsilateral facial paralysis, which can be either partial or complete. Injury to the chorda tympani results in a loss of taste or a metallic taste to the ipsilateral aspect of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, which often resolves over time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Middle ear trauma is typically identified during clinical evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Awake and alert patients with a history of closed head injury or direct ear trauma should be asked about the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial weakness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertigo</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New onset otorrhea (purulent, bloody, clear, or sticky) or clear, particularly unilateral, rhinorrhea that is worse with straining (Valsalva) or positioning of the head in a dependent position </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imbalance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tinnitus (suggesting concomitant inner ear damage) which may manifest as intermittent or continuous, loud or soft, high- or low-pitched</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with suspected middle ear trauma should undergo evaluation and management based upon the patient's mechanism of injury and physical findings. The clinician should evaluate unstable patients and those with a high-risk trauma mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>) according to the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 3</a>). Middle ear assessment should be part of the secondary survey in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the ear requires inspection of the auricle and surrounding area; otoscopy of the external canal, tympanic membrane, and middle ear; and, in patients without obvious tympanic membrane perforation, assessment of tympanic membrane function by pneumatic otoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70700\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70700 \">movie 1</a>). In patients with an intact tympanic membrane, decreased motion or immobility of the tympanic membrane, dullness of landmarks, or an air fluid level suggests fluid in the middle ear.</p><p>In patients with tympanic membrane perforation, pneumatic otoscopy should be deferred to the specialist because it can potentially push air into the otic capsule leading to nystagmus, vertigo, and nausea or vomiting in patients with otic capsule injuries.</p><p>In cooperative patients above five to six years of age, Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests allow for the assessment of hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Blood clots in the ear canal in patients with other signs of middle ear trauma should not be removed until the patient is evaluated by an otolaryngologist. In addition, protruding aural foreign bodies should be left in place until they can be fully assessed and removed under controlled conditions by the specialist and possibly in the operating room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Findings of middle ear injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Middle ear trauma should be suspected in patients with concerning history and the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemotympanum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amber or clear middle ear effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otorrhea (clear or bloody ear canal drainage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing deficit by Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032 \">figure 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nystagmus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ataxia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroauricular hematoma (Battle sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69660 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p>Battle sign typically appears two days after injury, but may appear within 6 to 12 hours.</p><p>In young children and the elderly, certain patterns of ear trauma (eg, bilateral auricular hematomas) or major injuries (eg, basilar skull fractures) that are unexplained by history raise suspicion for physical abuse. A complete physical examination and additional studies are warranted to identify other signs of abuse in these patients.

Facial nerve function is assessed by observing the response to commands for closing the eyes, elevating the brow, and <span class=\"nowrap\">smiling/frowning</span>. Patients with a peripheral facial nerve palsy associated with middle ear trauma may appear to have a facial droop associated with weakness of the forehead or they may appear to have the eye on the weakened side widely opened and the features of the weak side may be softer with absence of the nasolabial crease. These patients should be differentiated from those with stroke, in whom forehead and eyelid strength are preserved. The nasolabial folds and cheeks will be asymmetrical as the teeth are displayed, and the lower lip may appear to be somewhat hugging the teeth on the affected side. Decreased tearing, hyperacusis, loss of taste sensation on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a metallic taste can also indicate facial nerve disruption localized to the fallopian canal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Facial response to a painful stimulus may be helpful in patients who are unable to cooperate or have altered mental status. Early assessment is crucial as a predictor of prognosis, and it directs management steps in the setting of facial nerve weakness or paralysis. After initial examination and stabilization, patients with significant trauma may be sedated or comatose. This situation often complicates further evaluation of facial nerve function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with clinical features suggestive of middle ear trauma warrant the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of any ear or nose drainage for the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests of hearing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with head trauma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who may require operative intervention, temporal bone computed tomography without contrast including fine axial and coronal cuts</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of ear or nose drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To test for CSF leakage, the clinician may perform a quick bedside test by placing a drop of ear or nose drainage on filter paper (coffee filter or paper towel). A rapidly advancing &quot;halo&quot; or ring of clear fluid around red blood defines a positive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of note, the halo test does NOT differentiate among CSF, saline, saliva, and other clear fluids and has not been formally studied in a clinical setting.</p><p>Alternatively, the clinician may test the ear or nose drainage for beta-2-transferrin, a desialylated form of the protein transferrin, which is almost exclusively found in CSF. A retrospective observational study of 205 beta-2-transferrin tests in 182 patients with suspected CSF leak found a sensitivity of 97 percent and a specificity of 99 percent for beta-2-transferrin measured in fluid obtained from the nose or ear, although all but 11 patients in this study had rhinorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Beta-2-transferrin assays may not be immediately available in all settings. Frequently, it is a send-out test that can take 72 hours to complete.</p><p>Urine dipsticks should <strong>not</strong> be used to determine the presence of CSF by checking for the presence of glucose. This approach is NOT reliable because both blood and CSF contain glucose.</p><p>Localization of the fistula may require nuclear medicine or an intraoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> dye study in which a lumbar puncture is performed and either a radio-labeled sugar or fluorescein dye is injected into the CSF. The site of leakage is then determined either by collection of radio-labeled sugar on pledgets placed in these cavities or by endoscopic identification of the fluorescein dye in the nose or during operative middle ear or mastoid exploration. CSF leaks that persist are associated with higher risks of complication, such as meningitis. Confirmed CSF leaks are treated according to location with techniques such as fascia grafting, bone grafting, dura grafting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lumbar drain or shunting. When in doubt about the presence of a CSF leak, it is best to obtain urgent neurosurgical consultation.

Pure tone audiometry provides an objective assessment of hearing and is helpful in determining management and prognosis. The ability to hear a whisper and symmetric hearing by report may suffice as an initial screening test if pure tone audiometry is not immediately available. However, patients who do not undergo immediate audiometry should be referred to audiology as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours.
