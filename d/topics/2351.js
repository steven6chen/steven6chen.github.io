This has two important implications: a large portion of the circuit can be recorded directly, and the circuit is uniquely sensitive to the effects of focal ablation. The circuit involves antegrade conduction over the right bundle branch and retrograde conduction over the left bundle branch; the His bundle is adjacent to but separate from the circuit. </p><p>BBRVT can be very rapid (often &gt;200 bpm), often resulting in syncope or cardiac arrest. It is a relatively rare arrhythmia, usually seen in patients with advanced structural heart disease, and it forms part of the differential diagnosis of wide complex tachycardias (in addition to myocardial VT, supraventricular tachycardia [SVT] with aberrancy of the left bundle branch, pre-excited tachycardias using nodofascicular or atrial fascicular bypass tracts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A related disorder, intrafascicular reentry, utilizes the separate fascicles of the left bundle branch. It, too, is typically observed in patients with advanced structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Both arrhythmias depend on conduction delay in the His Purkinje system.</p><p>The mechanisms, clinical features, and treatment of BBRVT will be discussed here. The general approach to wide QRS complex tachycardias as well as the treatment of VT of other etiologies (ie, ischemic, scar-related) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM AND THE RESULTANT ELECTROCARDIOGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In sinus rhythm, most patients with BBRVT have a prolonged QRS (nonspecific conduction delay or left bundle branch block [LBBB]), and most have a prolonged His to ventricle (HV) interval. It is important to consider that although we speak of LBBB as an electrocardiographic pattern, the phenomena is typically a delay rather than a block, as retrograde complete LBBB would make this arrhythmia circuit impossible. The arrhythmia begins when one or more premature ventricular beats arise and conduct into both the right bundle branch, where retrograde activation is blocked due to refractoriness from the preceding normally conducted antegrade beat, and into the left bundle branch, which has a shorter refractory period than the right bundle branch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75164 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, the impulse conducts retrogradely up the left bundle branch to the bundle of His, although the His bundle is not an essential component of the circuit. The impulse then conducts antegradely down the right bundle branch, activating the ventricle at the termination of the right bundle branch. For this reason, the QRS during VT has an LBBB pattern and may closely resemble the sinus rhythm QRS if baseline LBBB is present. If the timing is right and slow conduction through the circuit allows for recovery from refractoriness of all of the component parts, sustained reentry may be established.</p><p>HV interval prolongation during sinus rhythm is common in patients with BBRVT, and a prolonged HV interval has been put forth as a prerequisite for developing sustained reentry within the bundle branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/2,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-10</a>]. However, HV prolongation in sinus rhythm is not present in all cases, suggesting that BBRVT can result from functional conduction abnormalities in the His-Purkinje system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19126553\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF BBRVT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BBRVT is recognized by the following characteristics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology (although so-called &quot;reverse&quot; BBRVT may also occur, with activation of the ventricles over the left bundle branch, producing a right bundle branch block [RBBB] QRS morphology) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The His to ventricle (HV) interval during VT is typically longer than during sinus rhythm </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During spontaneous changes in cycle length, changes in the H-H interval precede and predict changes in the V-V interval</p><p/><p>The antegrade conduction down the right bundle branch with delayed depolarization of the left ventricle results in a ventricular tachycardia with a typical LBBB appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67679\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67679 \">waveform 1</a>). In some patients, however, the reverse sequence of conduction occurs, leading a RBBB appearance. The PR interval may be normal or prolonged. The mean electrical axis is usually about +30&ordm;, but a conduction defect in the left anterior fascicle will produce a marked leftward (superior) axis deviation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79400\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79400 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Most patients have a similar electrocardiogram (ECG) during sinus rhythm because of the underlying prolongation of the HV interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67679\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67679 \">waveform 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BBRVT, usually seen in patients with advanced structural heart disease, occurs with both ischemic and nonischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The heart disease is usually severe with cardiomegaly and a history of heart failure. Presyncope and syncope are common presenting symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of BBRVT is suggested from the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded during VT. However, VT of other types and supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) with a preceding bundle branch block (BBB), functional BBB, or pre-excitation may also have a left bundle branch block (LBBB) appearance. BBRVT has a rather &quot;typical&quot; LBBB pattern as does an SVT with pre-existing or functional BBB. In comparison, an &quot;atypical&quot; LBBB pattern (slurring of the initial QRS forces) favors myocardial VT or pre-excited tachycardia.</p><p>While the presence of BBRVT may be suspected from the surface ECG, definitively establishing the diagnosis often requires electrophysiologic testing to differentiate this arrhythmia from other forms of VT. The general approach to wide complex tachycardias is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is frequently necessary in BBRVT, since BBRVT typically occurs in the presence of significant heart disease and often leads to hemodynamic compromise and presyncope or syncope. Because of the high risk of recurrence with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, we prefer catheter ablation as the therapy of choice for BBRVT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BBRVT is often resistant to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. In one study of seven patients, for example, four presented with syncope and three with aborted sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The patients, who had been unsuccessfully treated with two to four antiarrhythmic drugs, were successfully treated with catheter ablation of the right bundle branch.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In comparison to the lack of efficacy with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, catheter ablation effectively and safely eliminates BBRVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/3,4,6-8,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6-8,12-14</a>]. We agree with the 2006 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/European</span> Society of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/ESC)</span> guidelines for the management of ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD), which recommend catheter ablation of the right bundle branch for patients with BBRVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition to catheter ablation, many such patients will still have an indication for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'ICD therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Most commonly, catheter ablation of the right bundle branch is performed, leading to complete right bundle branch block (RBBB). In this procedure, a catheter is inserted into the femoral vein and passed through the tricuspid valve until a right bundle electrogram is recorded. Both DC shock and radiofrequency ablation have been used with success and we consider ablation to be the treatment of choice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67679\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67679 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77331\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77331 \">waveform 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80017\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80017 \">waveform 3</a>)</p><p>BBRVT has also been treated by ablation of the left bundle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This provides the theoretical advantage of preventing the need for pacing, as the relatively normal right bundle branch remains unaffected; however, since the majority of patients with BBRVT require ICD therapy anyway (see below), and because this is more difficult than ablating the right bundle, it is seldom performed. Reentrant fascicular tachycardia has also been treated successfully using ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Catheter ablation has been very successful in BBRVT due to bundle branch reentry that characteristically has a left (rarely a right) bundle branch morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/2,7,8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8,12</a>]. Excellent success rates were noted in a study of ablation in 28 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These results suggest that ablation therapy is the treatment of choice for this type of VT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">ICD therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following catheter ablation for BBRVT, repeat electrophysiologic testing generally reveals an inability to induce BBRVT. However, VT of myocardial origin can be induced in some cases, although only a small number of patients have been studied. Because of the concurrent underlying structural heart disease, outcomes are often quite poor in patients followed after successful ablation of BBRVT. SCD has been reported, and progressive heart failure is frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Due to the severity of underlying cardiac disease, many patients are candidates for ICD therapy for the primary or secondary prevention of SCD following catheter ablation for BBRVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
