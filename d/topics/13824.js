When people have PKD, abnormal fluid-filled sacs called &quot;cysts&quot; grow in the kidneys.</p><p>The cysts cause the kidneys to get bigger than normal. The cysts can also keep the kidneys from working normally. This can lead to problems, such as high blood pressure, kidney infections, and kidney failure. Kidney failure is when the kidneys stop working completely. Besides kidney problems, PKD can cause problems in other parts of the body.</p><p>PKD usually runs in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567781\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PKD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with PKD have no symptoms. When people do have symptoms, they can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the lower half of the back or on the side, with or without a fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the belly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones &ndash; These are small, stone-like objects that form inside the kidneys. They can cause belly or side pain, or blood in the urine.</p><p/><p>PKD can also cause problems in other parts of the body, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bulging blood vessel in the brain &ndash; If the blood vessel bursts, it can cause a sudden, severe headache and nausea and vomiting. A burst blood vessel can lead to brain damage and even death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cysts in the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 2</a>) &ndash; These can cause belly pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A weak area in the belly muscles (called a &quot;hernia&quot;) &ndash; This can cause an area of the belly to bulge out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart problems &ndash; These do not usually cause symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567788\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for PKD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To find out if you have PKD, your doctor can do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test, such as an ultrasound, CT, or MRI scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check for the abnormal genes that cause the disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567795\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PKD treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat PKD by treating the symptoms and problems the disease causes.</p><p>For example, doctors can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat high blood pressure with lifestyle changes, diet changes, and medicines &ndash; Treating high blood pressure can help the kidneys stay healthy for a longer time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat kidney infections with antibiotic medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat pain with pain-relieving medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do surgery to fix a bulging blood vessel in the brain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do surgery to fix a hernia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567802\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my kidneys stop working completely?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your kidneys stop working completely, you will need treatment that takes over the job of your kidneys. Normally, the kidneys make urine by removing waste and excess salt and water from the blood.</p><p>There are 2 treatments for people whose kidneys stop working completely. They are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called dialysis &ndash; There are 2 types of dialysis, but most people with PKD have a type called &quot;hemodialysis.&quot; During hemodialysis, a machine removes waste and excess salt and water from the blood. People who get hemodialysis need to be hooked up to a machine for a few hours at least 3 times a week. They will need hemodialysis for the rest of their life or until they can get a kidney transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney transplant surgery &ndash; During this surgery, a doctor replaces your diseased kidney with a healthy kidney. That way, the new kidney can do the job of your kidneys. (People need only one healthy kidney to live.)</p><p/><p>If you have questions about the different options, talk with your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567809\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my family members get tested?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have PKD, your adult family members should talk with their doctor about getting tested for it. There are benefits and downsides to getting tested.</p><p>Doctors do not usually recommend that children get tested unless they have symptoms. But children should see their doctor or nurse every year to have their blood pressure checked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567816\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=planning-for-a-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Planning for a kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
