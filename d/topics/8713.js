The autoantibodies also affect megakaryocytes and impair platelet production. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia and the lack of a clinically-apparent condition responsible for the low platelet count; there are no reliable laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The major initial decisions regarding treatment are whether the patient needs any therapy, and if so, which therapy to use. These decisions can be challenging because the goal of treatment is to prevent severe bleeding, but the risk of bleeding can be difficult to estimate for any individual patient. Severe bleeding is rare, and patients may be more likely to develop complications from the toxicities of therapy than they are to have severe bleeding.</p><p>The initial treatment and prognosis of ITP in adults is reviewed here. Second--line therapies for adults who require additional treatment, and the management of ITP in children, who have a different clinical course from adults, are discussed separately.

These terms have been replaced by immune thrombocytopenia to reflect the known autoantibody mechanism and absence of purpura in some patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First-line versus second-line therapy</strong> &ndash; We use &quot;first-line&quot; to refer to glucocorticoids and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) because they are generally used for initial treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Historically, second-line therapy meant splenectomy. However, the availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> has expanded the second-line options. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are useful if second-line agents fail, or they may be considered another second line therapy option. Most patients will be treated sequentially with a period of observation if possible, followed by first-line, second-line, and, if needed, other therapies, until a safe platelet count is achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Second-line and subsequent therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6197902\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of ITP therapy is to reduce the risk of clinically important bleeding; thus, many patients do not require interventions to increase the platelet count. The need for intervention is guided by bleeding symptoms and the platelet count (ie, whether it is low enough to confer severe bleeding risk). The choice of therapy depends on how rapidly the platelet count needs to be raised and the differing toxicity profiles of available therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of ITP treatment is to provide a safe platelet count to prevent clinically important bleeding, rather than to normalize the platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Clinically important bleeding is often defined as bleeding that requires medical attention. It may range in severity from life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage to symptoms such as frequent nosebleeds that do not stop with local hemostatic measures, severe menorrhagia that requires hormonal intervention, or oral mucosal blood blisters that may signify greater risk for clinically important bleeding. </p><p>The overall risk of bleeding in ITP is low; it is greatest in individuals with platelet counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span>. However, the correlation between platelet count and bleeding risk is weak even in patients with severely low platelet counts (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL)</span>. Life-threatening bleeding is rare, but hemorrhagic deaths have been reported. Sites of severe bleeding include intracerebral and gastrointestinal, and a variety of mucosal surfaces (eg, lung, genitourinary tract) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H28169821\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of bleeding'</a> below and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>Factors that increase the bleeding risk include a history of prior bleeding and older age. The role of these factors was illustrated in a series of 117 adults that found severe bleeding rates in individuals &lt;40, 40 to 60, and &gt;60 years of age of 0.4, 1.1, and 10.4 percent per patient per year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A previous bleeding event conferred a relative risk of bleeding of 27.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The following summarizes our approach to initiating therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54047\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54047 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with severe bleeding (eg, intracranial, gastrointestinal) and a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL,</span> we recommend immediate platelet transfusion along with ITP-specific therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and high dose glucocorticoids. Platelet transfusions are also appropriate for some patients with higher platelet counts and bleeding in critical sites; early involvement of the consulting hematologist is advised. (See <a href=\"#H28169821\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of bleeding'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H558395184\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Actively bleeding patient'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with a new diagnosis of ITP and any clinically important bleeding, we recommend ITP-specific therapy, rather than observation, to reduce the risk of worsening bleeding complications. We also suggest ITP-specific therapy for patients with a new diagnosis of ITP and a platelet count &lt;20,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> even in the absence of bleeding symptoms, because the thrombocytopenia may be persistent and become more severe. A platelet count above <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> provides a margin of safety since severe bleeding typically does not occur unless the platelet count is &lt;10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL</span>. Some patients with platelet counts between 20,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> may be managed safely with observation and close monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;30,000/microL</span> may require treatment if they have an increased risk of bleeding (eg, peptic ulcer disease, high risk of falling); other hemostatic defects (eg, use of antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants); a history of bleeding at a higher platelet count; or a need for <span class=\"nowrap\">surgery/invasive</span> procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. For some patients, maintaining the platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL</span> may be desirable because of lifestyle (eg, active sports) or occupation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require therapy but do not have severe bleeding requiring platelet transfusion, we suggest glucocorticoids, rather than IVIG, because glucocorticoids are easy to administer and lower in cost. Short-term glucocorticoid administration is generally safe and well-tolerated. However, IVIG may be used for some patients who do not tolerate glucocorticoid toxicities or added to glucocorticoid treatment for patients who require a more rapid platelet count increase. (See <a href=\"#H88767833\" class=\"local\">'Choice of first-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not administering ITP-specific therapy in the majority of patients with platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;30,000/microL;</span> these patients can be monitored on a regular basis. Unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia should be avoided because there is a risk of potential toxicities in the setting of extremely low to no increased risk of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H88767810\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1370199\" class=\"local\">'Disease course'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of therapy, all patients should be monitored regularly and advised to consult their clinician for any signs of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H88767810\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>This approach is compatible with guidelines for ITP issued by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology, General Haematology Task Force in 2003, an international consensus report published in 2010, and the American Society of Hematology evidence-based practice guideline published in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18960585\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapeutic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of other issues warrant consideration along with the decision of whether to administer treatment to increase the platelet count. We address the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirmation of the diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Although ITP is likely to be the correct diagnosis in the majority of patients with isolated severe thrombocytopenia, referral to a hematologist is appropriate for all patients with a new observation of thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span>. Occasionally, patients are mistakenly labeled as having ITP and are unnecessarily exposed to treatments, including long-term glucocorticoid administration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenectomy, when they actually have other conditions (eg, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, congenital platelet disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, it is important to consider alternative diagnoses before initiating therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"#H4762390\" class=\"local\">'Hematologist referral'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation for HIV, HCV, H. pylori, and hepatitis B</strong> &ndash; We do not perform an extensive evaluation for underlying conditions associated with secondary ITP in the absence of specific indications. However, it is appropriate to perform screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in all patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In North America, we do not routinely screen patients for Helicobacter pylori infection, although this may be indicated in other parts of the world, such as Japan, where the infection is endemic and more closely linked to ITP. This issue is discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H88769745\" class=\"local\">'Helicobacter pylori infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who will receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, which we reserve for second-line therapy, should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). However, prior treatment with IVIG may confound anti-HBc results due to the passive transfer of the antibody in IVIG; thus, testing for HBSAg and anti-HBc may also be done earlier in the patient's course if the need for therapeutic intervention is likely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Shared decision-making</strong> &ndash; The ultimate decision to initiate treatment should be shared between the clinician and the patient. The risks and benefits of treatment versus close monitoring should be considered, especially in asymptomatic patients, since therapies for ITP may have substantial toxicities. Patient support materials are available on several websites, many of which are collated by the author (JG) on <a href=\"http://www.ouhsc.edu/platelets/ITP/itp+patient+support+groups.html&amp;token=wE5idIsweqOFT8ub3H7Xv+49PBshNgAy+cHz1/ljVO8MGLjjHJ8p1SAAbCMawOd5rsePSawx9e8yf2j0y1FlNFEDA/D8cCVfquZSkqxyThI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6677\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">our website</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunizations</strong> &ndash; Patients should be current with all recommended routine immunizations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 2</a>) because ITP therapies are immunosuppressive and may blunt immunization responses.

Individual considerations apply to participation in certain activities. As an example, those with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;50,000/microL)</span> may need to avoid extreme sports such as boxing, rugby, and martial arts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of antiplatelet agents</strong> &ndash; Patients should be educated about which medications and non-prescription remedies interfere with platelet function (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ginkgo biloba). In general, these agents should be avoided unless there is a specific indication for which equivalent alternatives are lacking. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>) are not expected to affect platelet function substantially. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;, section on 'Lack of effect upon platelets'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, however, appropriate antithrombotic therapies should not be withheld from a patient with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL)</span> if indicated (eg, patient with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation). For patients with more severe thrombocytopenia, decisions are made on a case-by-case basis regarding the risks of bleeding and benefits of anticoagulation. The consequences of thrombosis are generally more severe than the consequences of thrombocytopenia, and often therapy to prevent thrombosis can be administered along with therapy to raise the platelet count if needed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88767810\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring of patients with ITP includes clinical evaluation for bleeding and measurement of the platelet count.

However, platelet count recovery may require more than one course (for high-dose dexamethasone) or several weeks of administration (for oral prednisone).

For individuals who have received more than one or two weeks of daily prednisone, the dose is tapered. There is no standard duration of the taper, and hematologists vary on their preference for a more rapid taper to reduce toxicities versus a more gradual taper to increase the chance of remission. Our practice is to taper and discontinue prednisone as rapidly as possible, usually over eight to ten weeks. If the platelet count falls during the taper, we prefer using other therapies (eg, IVIG) instead of continuing a prolonged course of prednisone. Additional issues related to glucocorticoid tapering are presented separately.

The effect of IVIG is usually transient; thus it is most useful for patients who require a rapid, temporary increase in platelet count (eg, before an urgent invasive procedure) or who are unable to tolerate glucocorticoids and are awaiting initiation of second-line therapy. IVIG increases the platelet count by interfering with macrophage uptake of autoantibody-coated platelets (ie, &quot;overwhelming&quot; the reticuloendothelial system).

The overall risk of bleeding in ITP is low, but severe and life-threatening bleeding can occur. Bleeding risk is greatest in individuals with platelet counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span>.

Platelet transfusions are also appropriate for some patients with higher platelet counts and bleeding in critical sites; early involvement of the consulting hematologist is advised. Platelet transfusions may be effective even if the post-transfusion platelet count does not increase. (See <a href=\"#H28169821\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with a new diagnosis of ITP and any clinically important bleeding, we recommend ITP-specific therapy rather than observation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54047\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54047 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
