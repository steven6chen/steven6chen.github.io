The presence of infection is documented by a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture and an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count (&ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm3)</span>. The absolute PMN count is calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell count (or total &quot;nucleated cell&quot; count) by the percentage of PMNs in the differential. The cell count and differential are performed manually without formal quality control. The accuracy of these tests is totally dependent upon the skill and interest of the medical technologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of SBP will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of SBP are discussed separately.

Over the past decades, this void of information has been at least partially filled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52311 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology and bacterial entry into ascites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the early steps in the development of SBP is a disturbance in gut flora with overgrowth and extraintestinal dissemination of a specific organism, most commonly Escherichia coli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80188 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Cirrhosis predisposes to the development of bacterial overgrowth, possibly because of altered small intestinal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and the presence of hypochlorhydria due to use of proton pump inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, patients with cirrhosis may have increased intestinal permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>However, the role of bacterial overgrowth in the pathogenesis of SBP remains unsettled. In one study, small bowel motility and bacterial overgrowth were compared in 20 patients with cirrhosis and a history of SBP and 20 patients with cirrhosis without a history of SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The prevalence of bacterial overgrowth was higher in the patients with a history of SBP (70 versus 20 percent); these patients also exhibited more severe small intestinal motility disturbances. In contrast, in another study, the presence of bacterial overgrowth was not associated with the development of SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whether or not they are present in increased numbers, bacteria within the gut lumen can traverse the intestinal wall, and colonize mesenteric lymph nodes. This phenomenon is called translocation and has been documented to occur in animal models of cirrhosis and SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Bacterascites can occur if the lymphatic carrying the contaminated lymph ruptures because of the high flow and high pressure associated with portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Alternatively, the organism can move from the mesenteric lymphatics to the systemic circulation and then percolate through the liver and weep across Glisson's capsule to enter the ascitic fluid.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that bacterial translocation is also increased in patients with advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In an illustrative study, mesenteric lymph nodes were obtained from 101 patients with cirrhosis and from 35 non-cirrhotic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Enteric organisms were grown from culture in only 8.6 percent of controls compared to 3.4, 8.1, and 30.8 percent of patients with Child class A, B, and C cirrhosis, respectively. Selective intestinal decontamination reduced the rate of positive cultures to that of non-cirrhotic patients.</p><p>Other studies have shown molecular evidence of bacterial translocation and suggested that it occurs prior to the development of clinical SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites can have bacterial DNA in their serum and ascitic fluid even when viable organisms cannot be cultured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Low levels of translocation of intact bacteria or pieces of bacteria may lead to activation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may explain the higher levels of TNF that have been observed in patients who ultimately develop SBP compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The presence of bacterial DNA in serum and ascitic fluid is a risk factor for death in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Proton pump inhibitors increased bacterial translocation in an animal model of SBP and also increase the risk of SBP in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Proton pump inhibitors have also been shown in humans to decrease phagocyte oxidative burst; this could further handicap defenses against resident bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Bacteria that eventually cause SBP can also originate in sites other than the gut via bacteremic seeding. These include urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], pneumococcal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], cellulitis, pharyngitis, and dental infections. These infections are labeled &quot;spontaneous&quot; because they are not amenable to surgical therapy. Surgically treatable infections, eg, perforated duodenal ulcer, that lead to ascitic fluid infection are called secondary bacterial peritonitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.) The pathogenesis of this form of peritonitis is quite different than that of SBP; millions of bacteria flood into the peritoneum through the rent in the gut wall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Host defenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the organism enters ascitic fluid, a battle ensues between the virulence of the bacteria and the host's resistance to infection. Microbes that cause SBP are usually serum-resistant, ie, they cannot be killed by serum alone but also require functional phagocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Foreign matter is first &quot;opsonized&quot; with complement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> globulin so that it is more identifiable by and digestible to phagocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The resident macrophages represent the first line of defense of the peritoneal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. If these phagocytes fail to eradicate the colonizing microbes, complement is activated and cytokines are released. PMNs enter the peritoneum to seek and destroy the invading organisms. If, however, complement levels are inadequate or the PMNs are dysfunctional, then colonization may not be contained and a potentially fatal infection may ensue.</p><p>Cirrhosis is actually one of the most common forms of acquired immune deficiency, creating an environment that facilitates the persistence of peritoneal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum complement deficiency is quite common in patients with liver disease that is advanced enough to produce ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Furthermore, ascitic fluid is frequently a fivefold or even 10-fold dilution of serum in patients with cirrhosis; thus, ascitic fluid complement concentrations may drop to levels similar to those of the serum of patients with congenital complement deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The function of both motile (eg, PMNs) and stationary phagocytes (eg, Kupffer cells) is reduced in patients with advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with SBP have advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
