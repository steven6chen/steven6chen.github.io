Out-toeing is a rotational variation of the lower extremity where the feet or toes point away from the midline during gait (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75796\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75796 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In-toeing and out-toeing are among the most common anatomic musculoskeletal variations encountered by pediatric primary care providers and a frequent reason for referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon. However, most children with in-toeing or out-toeing have variations of normal lower-extremity development that will improve spontaneously and can be monitored by the primary care provider.</p><p>An understanding of the normal growth and development of the lower extremity is essential in evaluating a child's rotational alignment and helps to elucidate the mechanism of in-toeing. The most common causes of in-toeing in children are metatarsus adductus, internal tibial torsion, and increased femoral anteversion. These rotational variations are seen in normal, healthy children, and rarely persist into adolescence. Even when persistent, in-toeing rarely causes dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. History and examination generally are sufficient to distinguish common rotational variations from less common pathologic causes of in-toeing and out-toeing (eg, hemiplegic cerebral palsy). (See <a href=\"#H21546688\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of lower-extremity rotational development, common causes of in-toeing, pathologic causes of in-toeing that must be excluded, and an approach to the evaluation and management of the child with in-toeing. Out-toeing is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with out-toeing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21546639\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PHYSIOLOGIC ALIGNMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotational alignment of the lower extremity is determined by the alignment of the foot, the rotation of the tibia in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur (tibial torsion), and the rotation of the neck of the femur in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur (femoral anteversion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56825 \">figure 2</a>). In-toeing and out-toeing may be accentuated between six months and five years, when children are developing their walking and coordination skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Normal growth and improved coordination typically lead to spontaneous resolution of rotational variations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64901 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Intrauterine positioning has an important influence on the rotational alignment of the legs. At the seventh week of gestation, the lower limb rotates medially (internally), followed by external (lateral) rotation of the upper leg. For the remainder of gestation, the tibiae and feet are medially (internally) rotated, and the hips and femora are laterally (externally) rotated, resulting in an external rotation contracture at the hip joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79381\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79381 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Normal newborn posture reflects intrauterine positioning. The hips are flexed and externally rotated, with the patellae pointing outward. The tibiae and feet remain relatively internally rotated, but this is overshadowed by the external rotation contracture at the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Out-toeing due to external rotation contracture of the hip usually resolves by the time the child begins walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21546646\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES OF IN-TOEING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of in-toeing originate from the foot (metatarsus adductus), lower leg (internal tibial torsion), and hip (increased femoral anteversion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68100\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68100 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These conditions may occur in combination, which increases the severity of in-toeing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. They generally do not cause pain or interfere with development or stability of gait, although children with in-toeing may stumble or trip more frequently than other children, particularly when they are tired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21546653\"><span class=\"h2\">Metatarsus adductus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metatarsus adductus is characterized by angulation at the midfoot, with the metatarsals pointing toward the midline relative to the hindfoot. This gives the foot a &quot;kidney bean&quot; or &quot;C&quot; shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57425 \">picture 1</a>). Metatarsus adductus is the most common cause of in-toeing in infants younger than one year of age.</p><p>Metatarsus adductus is thought to result from intrauterine molding. It may be associated with other &quot;packaging problems,&quot; such as torticollis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An association between metatarsus adductus and developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) has been noted in some, but not all, studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The neck and hips of children with metatarsus adductus should be examined to exclude torticollis and DDH, but isolated metatarsus adductus is not an indication for hip imaging to exclude DDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The true incidence is difficult to determine because mild variations generally are not reported. Metatarsus adductus is most commonly diagnosed in children younger than two years of age and is more frequent in girls than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Metatarsus adductus is often bilateral; when unilateral, it occurs more often on the left than on the right (for unknown reasons) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On examination of the foot, the heel bisector line is lateral to the second toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60426 \">figure 4</a>). The hindfoot is in the neutral or valgus position, and the range of motion of the ankle and subtalar joint are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25515563\" class=\"local\">'Focused examination of the lower extremities'</a> below.)</p><p>Classification of metatarsus adductus also should be made according to the degree of flexibility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60426 \">figure 4</a>), which has implications for management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

It is the most common cause of in-toeing in children between one and three to four years of age and typically noticed when children begin to walk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p>Internal tibial torsion affects boys and girls equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It does not occur in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. External tibial torsion is more likely in premature infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing#H141829715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with out-toeing&quot;, section on 'External tibial torsion'</a>.)</p><p>Internal tibial torsion is bilateral in approximately two-thirds of cases; in unilateral cases, the left side is more commonly involved for unknown reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/17,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,22</a>]. Internal tibial torsion is associated with metatarsus adductus in about one-third of cases. It is often associated with, and may accentuate the appearance of, physiologic tibia vara and bow legs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-bow-legs#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with bow-legs&quot;, section on 'Physiologic varus'</a>.)</p><p>Characteristic examination features of internal tibial torsion include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When standing or walking, the foot points inward, and the patella points straight ahead or outward (an internal foot progression angle and a neutral or external patellar progression angle) (see <a href=\"#H25515547\" class=\"local\">'Observation of gait'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medial malleolus is level with or posterior to the lateral malleolus (with the child seated with the thigh directly in front of the hip joint and the knee pointed straight ahead)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the prone position, the thigh-foot angle is neutral or internal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68556 \">figure 5</a>)</p><p/><p>Internal tibial torsion typically resolves by five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, wide variation of tibial rotation is common. An internal thigh-foot angle of 20 degrees falls within 2 standard deviations (SD) of the mean in infants and toddlers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67096 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>Management of internal tibial torsion is discussed below.

Increased femoral anteversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50912\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50912 \">picture 2</a>) (also called medial femoral torsion) is associated with increased internal rotation and decreased external rotation at the hip.</p><p>Increased femoral anteversion is the result of intrauterine molding and genetic inheritance.

Although these etiologies are uncommon, they must be considered in the evaluation of a child with in-toeing because they do not resolve spontaneously. They can generally be excluded through history and physical examination.</p><p>Mild hemiplegic cerebral palsy rarely may present with an in-toeing gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Spasticity secondary to cerebral palsy may result in over-pull of the internal rotators of the hip or the adductors and inverters of the foot, which may cause an asymmetric, unilateral in-toeing gait. Asymmetry is a red flag. The history may reveal perinatal problems or abnormal developmental milestones. Examination may demonstrate spasticity of the gastro-soleus, hamstrings, and hip adductors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Such findings should prompt referral to a specialist (eg, neurologist, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist) for evaluation for cerebral palsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and classification of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Developmental dysplasia or dislocation of the hip may present with in-toeing related to limitation of hip abduction, leg-length discrepancy, or persistent increased femoral anteversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/4,8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,26</a>].

Unilateral limp while walking or running should raise suspicion of pathologic causes of in-toeing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25515563\"><span class=\"h3\">Focused examination of the lower extremities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the rotational alignment of the lower extremities is best done with the patient lying prone on the examination table [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The parents should be encouraged to stand with the examiner next to the patient so that they can appreciate the findings as the examination is performed. The examination should progress through the three main sites for rotational variations: foot, tibia, and <span class=\"nowrap\">femur/hip</span>. This can be accomplished by making the following measurements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heel bisector line &ndash; The heel bisector line is measured with the knee flexed and ankle dorsiflexed so that the plantar surface of the foot is parallel to the ceiling. A visual line is approximated parallel to the heel and extended distally to the toes. A normal heel bisector line goes through the second toe. Metatarsus adductus is diagnosed when this line passes through the more lateral toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60426 \">figure 4</a>). The more severe the deformity, the more lateral the line passes. Flexibility of metatarsus adductus also should be assessed by applying lateral force to the great toe and attempting to reduce the heel bisector line back to the second toe. (See <a href=\"#H21546653\" class=\"local\">'Metatarsus adductus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thigh-foot angle &ndash; The thigh-foot angle is measured with the knee flexed and the ankle dorsiflexed so that the plantar surface of the foot is parallel to the ceiling. Allow the foot to fall into a neutral position. A visual line is approximated along the long axis of the thigh and a second line along the long axis of the heel. The angle between these two lines is the thigh-foot angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68556 \">figure 5</a>). If the line of the heel points toward the midline relative to the thigh, it suggests internal torsion of the tibia. If the line of the heel points away from the midline relative to the thigh, it suggests external torsion of the tibia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normal values for the thigh-foot angle were determined in a study of 1000 limbs of 500 subjects (all white) ranging in age from &lt;1 to 70 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67096 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The average thigh-foot angle at birth is 5 degrees (external) and increases to 15 degrees (external) at maturity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip rotation &ndash; Hip rotation is measured with the knees flexed. Internal rotation is measured by rotating the leg away from the axis of the body (rotating the hip internally). External rotation is measured by rotating the leg towards the axis of the body (rotating the hip externally).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normal values for hip rotation were determined in a study of 1000 limbs of 500 subjects (all white) ranging in age from &lt;1 to 70 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71765 \">figure 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The average amount of internal hip rotation during childhood is between 40 and 50 degrees. The average amount of external hip rotation during childhood is between 40 and 70 degrees.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with increased femoral anteversion may have as much as 90 degrees of internal rotation, allowing the legs to rotate flat against the exam table [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similarly, they will have a decreased amount of external rotation, often only to neutral. Conversely, patients with femoral retroversion will have increased external rotation (to almost 90 degrees) and very little internal rotation.</p><p/><p>Other aspects of the lower-extremity examination that may be helpful in identifying associated conditions and excluding pathologic causes of in-toeing include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for associated angular variations (bow legs are associated with internal tibial torsion; knock-knees are associated with external tibial torsion) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-bow-legs#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with bow-legs&quot;, section on 'Physiologic varus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-knock-knees#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with knock-knees&quot;, section on 'Physiologic valgus'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of motion at the ankle; the ability to dorsiflex the ankle above neutral helps to exclude true clubfoot</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation and palpation of the medial aspect of the foot; a visible or palpable head of the talus may indicate skewfoot although additional evaluation is necessary</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90884693\"><span class=\"h3\">Parental rotational profiles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased femoral anteversion and internal tibial torsion tend to run in families.

The most common causes of in-toeing in children are metatarsus adductus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57425 \">picture 1</a>), internal tibial torsion, and increased femoral anteversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68100\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68100 \">table 2</a>). These rotational variations are related to intrauterine molding and resolve spontaneously through normal growth and development. (See <a href=\"#H21546639\" class=\"local\">'Normal physiologic alignment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21546646\" class=\"local\">'Common causes of in-toeing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metatarsus adductus is medial deviation of the forefoot on the hindfoot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57425 \">picture 1</a>). It is the most common cause of in-toeing in infants younger than one year of age. Metatarsus adductus is characterized by a &quot;kidney bean&quot; or &quot;C&quot; shape; heel bisector line that is lateral to the second toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60426 \">figure 4</a>); normal range of motion of the ankle and subtalar joint; internal foot progression angle; and a neutral or external patella progression angle. It usually resolves spontaneously by two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H21546653\" class=\"local\">'Metatarsus adductus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Internal tibial torsion is internal (medial) rotation of the tibia in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur. It is the most common cause of in-toeing in children between one and three to four years of age. Internal tibial torsion is characterized by a foot that points inward when the patella faces forward or externally; medial malleolus level with or posterior to the lateral malleolus (with the knee pointed straight); and neutral or internal thigh-foot angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68556 \">figure 5</a>). Internal tibial torsion usually resolves spontaneously by five years of age. (See <a href=\"#H21546660\" class=\"local\">'Internal tibial torsion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased femoral anteversion is an increased angle of rotation of the femoral neck in relation to transcondylar axis of the femur. It is the most common cause of in-toeing in children older than three years of age. Increased femoral anteversion is characterized by inward facing feet and patella during walking and standing; &quot;egg-beater&quot; pattern during running; symmetrically increased internal rotation and decreased external rotation of the hips; and preference for sitting in the &quot;W&quot; position. Increased femoral anteversion tends to improve spontaneously by 11 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H21546765\" class=\"local\">'Increased femoral anteversion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of the child with in-toeing include neuromuscular diseases (eg, cerebral palsy), disorders of the hip (eg, developmental dysplasia), and lower leg deformities (eg, skewfoot, clubfoot). These conditions usually can be excluded through history and examination. (See <a href=\"#H21546674\" class=\"local\">'Uncommon pathologic causes of in-toeing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21546688\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with rotational variations of the lower extremity can be followed in the primary care office.

Nonoperative interventions (eg, shoe inserts, braces, twister cables, casting) are ineffective in the treatment of internal tibial torsion and increased femoral anteversion. We recommend against such interventions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
