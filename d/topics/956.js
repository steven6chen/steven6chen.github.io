Angle-closure glaucoma (also called &quot;narrow-angle glaucoma&quot;) is the less common type. The more common type is called &quot;open-angle glaucoma.&quot;</p><p>Glaucoma is usually caused by pressure inside the eye. Angle-closure glaucoma happens when the fluid-draining system in the eye gets blocked. This causes eye pressure to rise quickly. It is different from open-angle glaucoma, which happens when eye pressure builds up slowly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24902424\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing halos around lights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very bad eye pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick (nausea) and throwing up (vomiting)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness in the white part of the eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling and cloudiness in the colored part of the eye</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24902439\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You should see an eye doctor right away if you have symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma. If you cannot get an appointment, go to an emergency room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24902454\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for angle-closure glaucoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for angle-closure glaucoma, doctors can use a few different tests. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look into the back of your eye with a magnifying tool to check for signs of nerve damage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a special tool to measure the angle at the opening where fluid drains from the eye</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well you see things in the center of your field of vision, and how well you see things that are off to the side</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check the pressure inside your eye by pushing or blowing on your eye with a special tool</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24902469\"><span class=\"h1\">How is angle-closure glaucoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for angle-closure glaucoma work by lowering the pressure inside the eye. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; These are usually given as eye drops. Sometimes, the medicines are given as pills or through a thin tube in a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser therapy &ndash; Laser therapy helps fluid drain from the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Surgery involves making a small opening or inserting a tiny tube in the eye so that fluid can drain better.</p><p/><p>People with angle-closure glaucoma who have not had laser therapy or surgery should not take certain over-the-counter medicines. Taking them might cause the problem to come back. These medicines include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat cold and allergy symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat motion sickness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24902484\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to prevent angle-closure glaucoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angle-closure glaucoma is more common in some families. If you have a family history of this condition, be sure to get regular eye exams, especially after middle age. If you have angle-closure glaucoma, tell your relatives (children, brothers, or sisters) that they should be tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24902501\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Open-angle glaucoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-vision-loss-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related vision loss (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
