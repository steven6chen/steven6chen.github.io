It is defined mechanistically as &quot;a pathologic fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The severity of clinical signs and symptoms vary between patients and more advanced disease is characterized by pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, duct distortion and strictures, calcifications, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, and dysplasia. In advanced disease, the structural changes, pain syndromes, and exocrine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endocrine pancreatic insufficiency appear to be irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The structural changes include irregular sclerotic and diffuse or focal destruction, acinar cell loss, islet cell loss, inflammatory cell infiltrate, and pancreatic duct abnormalities. Intraductal obstruction may be caused by protein plugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calculi. Chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis are distinguished by frequency of symptoms and presence or absence of irreversible changes in the pancreas or pancreatic function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109644 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis in children with chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis.

The child may have had a recognized episode of pancreatitis or may present with what appears to be the initial episode of pancreatitis but with a history of unexplained abdominal pain. The most common presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and poor growth. Less commonly, patients may be asymptomatic or present only after developing signs of pancreatic failure (eg, malabsorption, diabetes), which occur late in the course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/2,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6,7</a>]. The age of onset, rate of disease progression, and prognosis depend upon the specific etiology and severity of the underlying condition or process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and contributing risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis of pancreatitis in children is based upon a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory testing, and imaging, as outlined in a consensus statement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109644 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is the cardinal feature of chronic pancreatitis. The pain typically is epigastric, often radiates to the back, is often associated with nausea and vomiting, and may be relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward. </p><p>The pain pattern varies among patients and may change during the course of the disease. Early in the course of chronic pancreatitis, the pain may occur in discrete attacks; as the condition progresses, the pain tends to become more continuous. In some patients, with the loss of pancreatic tissue and fibrosis, the pain eventually improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in a long-term study of the natural history of chronic pancreatitis in 335 adults, the majority did not experience pain relief (so-called &quot;burnout&quot;) over more than 10 years of clinical follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Chronic pain, similar to other visceral pain syndromes, may evolve and lead to both peripheral and central sensitization. Patients may experience hyperalgesia or neuropathic pain, or both. Symptoms at sites inconsistent with pancreatic pain are legitimate symptoms of chronic pain, although this pattern is sometimes misinterpreted as falsified pain or malingering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Hyperalgesia is generally recognized as severe pain in response to light touch or brushing of the abdomen. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain in the absence of a clear nociceptive stimulus (eg, phantom limb pain). Neuropathic pain may be difficult to confirm in chronic pancreatitis because it can be difficult or impossible to demonstrate the absence of inflammation in the pancreas, yet studies suggest it is a component of pain in chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"#H1432315510\" class=\"local\">'Pain management'</a> below.)</p><p>Age and maturity may also affect a child's experience or expression of pain. Very young children may be irritable rather than complaining specifically of pain. Some children may develop depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety associated with chronic abdominal pain, but complain of pain rather than expressing these psychologic symptoms. Other children may deny pain because of fear of &quot;shots&quot; for pain relief.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in children is broad and includes physiological and functional disorders. Functional abdominal pain is the most common cause of chronic or recurrent abdominal pain in children. Functional abdominal pain usually is not related to meals, is rarely associated with vomiting, and does not affect the child's growth. The clinician must attempt to distinguish between possible causes of abdominal pain based on the clinical pattern of symptoms, supported by carefully selected laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pancreatitis may develop malabsorption of protein and fat due to exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. However, clinically significant protein and fat deficiencies do not occur until more than 70 to 90 percent of pancreatic exocrine function is lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a national series of 200 patients with hereditary pancreatitis in France, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency eventually developed in 34 percent and presented at a mean age of 29 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Clinically important nutrient deficiencies may occur in the absence of steatorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of fat malabsorption include loose, greasy, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush. It should be noted that these stool characteristics are not consistently found in patients with fat malabsorption and growth failure may be the main finding. Malabsorption of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> also may occur, although clinically symptomatic vitamin deficiency is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Malabsorption may also affect levels of other micronutrients, including magnesium, iron, zinc, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">selenium</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pancreatitis may develop endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, manifested by glucose intolerance. Overt diabetes mellitus usually occurs only late in the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. In a national series of 200 patients with hereditary pancreatitis in France, diabetes mellitus eventually developed in 26 percent and presented at a mean age of 38 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Patients with chronic calcifying disease, particularly those who develop early calcifications, appear to develop diabetes more frequently than those with chronic non-calcifying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Diabetes also is more likely to occur in patients with a family history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (probably because these patients have a decrease in pancreatic reserve or in insulin responsiveness).</p><p>Diabetes that is caused by chronic pancreatitis is known as pancreatic diabetes, or type 3c diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The primary abnormality is decreased insulin secretion, similar to type 1 diabetes. However, pancreatic diabetes is also characterized by impaired secretion of glucagon, which leads to hypoglycemia due to loss of the pancreatic counterregulatory mechanism. The problem of glucose control in patients with pancreatic diabetes is exacerbated by diminished pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion with maldigestion and delayed nutrient absorption, and altered gut hormone secretion. As a result, patients with this disorder are at increased risk for hypoglycemia. Ketoacidosis is relatively rare. Routine screening for diabetes is appropriate in patients with advanced pancreatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H1719019334\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the manifestations described above, chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis may present with or later develop signs or symptoms related to various complications. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile duct obstruction, which may cause abdominal pain and abnormal liver enzyme tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duodenal obstruction, which may cause postprandial pain and early satiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudocysts, which are usually asymptomatic but may be associated with fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epigastric mass.

The first step is a focused history and physical examination to help to distinguish this disorder from other causes of abdominal pain. If this evaluation is consistent with pancreatitis, further steps include laboratory testing and imaging, which are necessary to make the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109644 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. The initial steps in the evaluation can be taken by the primary care provider; referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist or other clinician with special expertise is valuable as soon as there is a strong suspicion for pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1753313782\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should include each of the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characterize the painful episodes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The initial onset, location, nature, duration, and progression of epigastric pain episodes should be established, as well as whether the episodes are triggered by food or exercise and whether there is associated vomiting (with or without flu-like symptoms). These characteristics can help to distinguish the pain of pancreatitis from the many other physiological and functional causes of abdominal pain. A standardized pain Likert score may be useful, either a numeric system for older children or a FACES scale for younger children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51021\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51021 \">figure 1</a>). It is important that the clinician acknowledge that the child's pain is real; children with a history of recurrent or chronic abdominal pain may have experienced disbelief on the part of family members or previous clinicians. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of pain management, including non-medication approaches (visual imaging, distraction, and formal training in these techniques), use of opioids (frequency and dose, who in the household controls the opioids), and use of non-opioids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gabapentin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>). This information may be useful in designing a treatment program in the future. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquire about psychosocial problems, such as include absences from school, inability to participate in sports, and withdrawal from social situations. Such problems are common in children with chronic pancreatitis and may be direct consequences of the painful episodes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> manifestations of associated anxiety or depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate for symptoms suggesting complications of chronic pancreatitis, including poor appetite and growth failure, diarrhea, and symptoms of diabetes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquire about clues to the cause of the chronic pancreatitis, including a history of acute pancreatitis, abdominal trauma (including sports-related trauma, as might occur in gymnastics), severe illness, toxic-metabolic risk factors including medications, and previous evaluation, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP). Risk factors for chronic pancreatitis are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65173\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65173 \">table 2</a>) and discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and contributing risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The family history should include questions about pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and cystic fibrosis in family members. The clinician should specifically ask about a family history of alcoholic pancreatitis because genetic risk factors may contribute to the development of this disorder. Families may not volunteer information about family members with alcoholic pancreatitis, believing that this history does not pertain to their child's problem. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1795020232\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal examination &ndash; This provides information to support or rule out the diagnosis and also helps to identify options for pain management. In patients with pancreatitis, the site(s) and severity of tenderness are generally the mid-epigastric, but may also be right and left upper quadrants. The spleen should be evaluated; splenomegaly suggests the possibility of splenic vein thrombosis, which can be a complication of chronic pancreatitis. Signs of constipation may be present and can be triggered by opioid use or poor fluid intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General physical examination &ndash; The general physical exam should evaluate for growth failure or weight loss, or other signs of malnutrition. Other sites where the patient experiences pain should also be evaluated. Chest wall musculoskeletal pain is common in patients with chronic pancreatitis, perhaps as a result of tension and positioning to relieve abdominal pain. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830784898\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the history and physical examination suggest a high index of suspicion for chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis, the next steps are laboratory testing and imaging to provide further evidence of the diagnosis and to evaluate for complications of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. </p><p>Laboratory tests provide important biomarker evidence of pancreatic dysfunction but cannot be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis outside of the clinical context (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109644 \">table 1</a>). Other laboratory tests are targeted to evaluate for risk factors for chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis, to exclude other causes of chronic abdominal pain, and to evaluate the child's general condition and nutritional state. </p><p>In children with previously confirmed or highly suspected chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis, laboratory testing includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum amylase and lipase &ndash; Elevation of amylase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lipase at least three times the upper limit of normal on several occasions, coupled with a characteristic episode of pain, supports a diagnosis of acute recurrent pancreatitis. However, lipase and amylase are made by tissues other than the pancreas and elevations do not always represent pancreatitis. Conversely, normal results for amylase and lipase do not exclude the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, albumin, glucose, and calcium &ndash; These results are usually normal in chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin &ndash; Elevations in these tests suggest concomitant liver disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bile duct obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fecal elastase &ndash; This is performed as a screening test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal elastase &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/g</span> stool suggests exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (although higher thresholds are sometimes used for patients with high risks for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, such as cystic fibrosis). The test should not be performed during an episode of acute pancreatitis because results may be temporarily low. Similarly, the test should not be performed in a patient with diarrhea because results will be falsely low levels due to dilution. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pancreatic insufficiency develops only after a substantial portion of the pancreas is destroyed. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency does not perfectly correlate with pain or fibrosis and it sometimes occurs in patients with otherwise limited signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Malabsorption'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fat-soluble vitamins &ndash; Fat-soluble vitamin status should be assessed by measuring vitamin A, vitamin E, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels. Vitamin K adequacy is assessed indirectly by measuring international normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-a\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin A&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-e\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin E&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1636363986\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation typically starts with abdominal ultrasonography, followed in most cases by magnetic resonance imaging cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP). MRCP may not be necessary if the ultrasonography clearly demonstrates a cause of the pancreatitis that can be treated by proceeding directly to therapeutic ERCP. (See <a href=\"#H1111083165\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic ERCP'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasonography with Doppler</strong> &ndash; The primary purpose of this test is to evaluate for evidence of biliary pathology such as gallstones, which may trigger episodes of acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In patients with more advanced disease, ultrasound also evaluates for complications of acute or chronic pancreatitis, including pseudocyst, or thrombosis of the portal or splenic veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MRCP</strong> &ndash; MRCP is the imaging study of choice in the evaluation for chronic pancreatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72655\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72655 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It provides anatomic detail of the pancreas and its ducts, without radiation. Findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis or chronic pancreatic damage include ductal changes (irregular contour of the main pancreatic duct or its radicles; intraductal filling defects; calculi, stricture, or dilation) and parenchymal changes (generalized or focal enlargement, irregular contour [accentuated lobular architecture], cavities, calcifications, heterogeneous echotexture) and atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/5,22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22-27</a>].

The diagnosis of acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis is made from a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.</p><p>Chronic pancreatitis in advanced stages is typically diagnosed by the combination of functional and structural features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain consistent with pancreatic origin (particularly if exacerbated by meals), with or without elevations in amylase and lipase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging findings demonstrating pancreatic atrophy, calcifications, increased diameter of the pancreatic duct or other ductal abnormalities</p><p/><p>Other supporting evidence may include episodes of severe exacerbation with amylase or lipase elevations, or evidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (low fecal elastase or high fecal fat), or endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (diabetes mellitus). Imaging studies alone are not diagnostic, especially in early stages of the syndrome. If chronic pancreatitis is suspected but initial imaging is normal, it may be necessary to follow the child for a time to confirm the diagnosis. Combinations of findings that can be used to make the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109644 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H670919798\"><span class=\"h1\">FURTHER EVALUATION FOR THE CAUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further evaluation to determine the cause or contributing risk factors for the chronic pancreatitis is directed by the results of the initial evaluation.

Pathogenic genetic variants in multiple susceptibility genes are common in children with unexplained acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis. Genetic testing should be performed in children with unexplained early chronic pancreatitis to define the etiology, classify the patients by syndrome and disease mechanisms, and guide future management. Other tests listed below are selected based upon suspicion for specific risk factors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3398614400\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by acute recurrent pancreatitis that typically begins in childhood and may progress to chronic pancreatitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary pancreatitis&quot;</a>). Clinical indications for genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis include unexplained chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. A low threshold for genetic testing is appropriate because of the high prevalence of genetic etiologies in pediatric populations and because genetic factors may interact with other risk factors (for example, pancreas divisum, trauma, or <span class=\"nowrap\">toxic/metabolic</span> causes) in the development of chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Genetic testing may be helpful in predicting the future course of the disease, counseling family members and, in some cases, increasing confidence in the diagnosis. It should be noted that some of the genetic risk factors occur at high frequency in the general population, so the finding of these mutations in the absence of clinical and radiographic abnormalities should not be construed as confirming the diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis. The finding of a genetic risk factor for chronic pancreatitis should trigger genetic counseling for the family and child (if appropriate for the child's age), as well as discussions about the risk of smoking or alcohol use, which can trigger or exacerbate the pancreatitis. The counseling may include information about the complications of chronic pancreatitis, including development of diabetes and increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

Management involves treating pain, ensuring adequate nutrition to preserve normal function and growth, and monitoring for complications of the disease. Patients experience exacerbations of disease that may resemble episodes of acute pancreatitis. Creating a specific plan for managing exacerbations helps to avoid unnecessary imaging studies and delay in pain management by other physicians who may be unfamiliar with chronic and recurrent acute pancreatitis. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis is detailed in a separate topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>); the main considerations for children are outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1111083165\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis and dilated main pancreatic duct may benefit from endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) or other surgical procedures to relieve the obstruction. The role of endoscopic versus surgical intervention has not been well established in either adults or children; however, most practitioners would perform ERCP to relieve obstruction before considering surgical drainage. Management in children is based on expert opinion, guided by indirect evidence from adults with chronic pancreatitis and a few small case series in children. Therapeutic ERCP in children requires special expertise and is generally available at major medical centers.

Routine monitoring should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of growth and nutritional status with serial plotting of height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) on growth charts, and tracking of pubertal development.

Measurement of fecal elastase is the simplest test for this purpose. The use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) does not interfere with fecal elastase testing, as PERT is porcine and the fecal elastase test measures human elastase. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Malabsorption'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of fat-soluble vitamin levels (vitamin A, E, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and prothrombin time <span class=\"nowrap\">[PT]/partial</span> thromboplastin time [PTT]). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus). An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the best test for endocrine insufficiency but may be too invasive or time consuming early in the course of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. Hemoglobin A1C, with or without a fasting glucose, is used as a screening test by some. This may not be the most sensitive test but may be acceptable, particularly in patients with preserved exocrine function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1432315510\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is by far the greatest burden in chronic pancreatitis, responsible for loss of school and social time and for many hospitalizations. Pain relief is crucial to management and crucial to the goal of maintaining as normal a life as possible.</p><p>Patients with chronic pain should ideally be evaluated by a skilled pediatric pain team <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychologist to develop an integrated pain management program.

Children should not control their own home medications, regardless of age. It is helpful to develop a specific plan for pain management in the event of hospitalization and include it in chart notes to facilitate early relief of pain during an exacerbation. The pain team can also develop treatment plans for hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain, and educate families on these symptoms.</p><p>Other factors may contribute to the child's distress and should be evaluated and specifically addressed. These include non-pancreatic sources of pain, such as constipation and musculoskeletal pain. Depression and anxiety are common among children with chronic pain, and treatment may improve the child's quality of life and ability to cope with the illness. Social engagement, a regular daytime schedule, and distraction are often beneficial; for this reason, it is often helpful to keep the child in school as much as possible rather than changing to home schooling, although individual families' decisions must be respected.</p><p>Evidence for other agents improving pain in chronic pancreatitis, including PERT and antioxidant therapy, is controversial. A trial of non-enteric-coated PERT is reasonable, but its efficacy is unproven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1404650280\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with chronic pancreatitis should be routinely monitored for growth and development, as well as for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. (See <a href=\"#H1719019334\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p>Children who develop significant weight loss, reduced BMI, or stunting of linear growth, or have severe disease and many hospital admissions, may benefit from nasogastric or nasojejunal feedings.

Such patients should be treated with PERT, as well as close monitoring and replacement of fat-soluble vitamins.

Early referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is valuable in guiding the evaluation and management. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial laboratory testing include a complete blood count (CBC), liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase. Normal results for amylase and lipase do not exclude the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. Elevation of amylase and or lipase at least three times the upper limit of normal supports a diagnosis of acute recurrent pancreatitis if it coincides with a characteristic episode of pain. (See <a href=\"#H1830784898\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The patient should also be evaluated for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by measuring fecal elastase, and for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. (See <a href=\"#H1830784898\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Imaging typically starts with abdominal ultrasonography, followed in most cases by magnetic resonance imaging cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRCP may not be necessary if the ultrasonography clearly demonstrates stigmata of chronic pancreatitis and a cause of the pancreatitis that can be treated by proceeding directly to therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP). (See <a href=\"#H1636363986\" class=\"local\">'Initial imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pancreatitis is most commonly diagnosed by the combination of abdominal pain consistent with pancreatic origin (particularly if exacerbated by meals) and imaging findings demonstrating pancreatic atrophy, calcifications, increased diameter of the pancreatic duct, or other ductal abnormalities. Combinations of findings that can be used to make the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109644 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3705350071\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation to determine the cause or contributing risk factors for the chronic pancreatitis is directed by the results of the initial evaluation. The main considerations are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65173\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65173 \">table 2</a>). Genetic testing should be performed for most children with chronic pancreatitis and ideally should include testing for mutations in the gene encoding serine protease 1<em> (PRSS1),</em> <strong>s</strong>erine <strong>p</strong>rotease <strong>in</strong>hibitor <strong>K</strong>azal type <strong>1</strong> gene (<em>SPINK1)</em>, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (<em>CFTR)</em>, and Chymotrypsinogen C<em> (CTRC).</em> Testing for toxic-metabolic risk factors or autoimmune disease is appropriate for selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H670919798\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation for the cause'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3398614400\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis involves managing pain and nutrition to preserve normal function and growth, and monitoring for complications of the disease, including psychosocial stress. Pain should be managed with a tiered program that includes non-medication strategies, non-opioid medications, and carefully planned use of opioids. (See <a href=\"#H1404650280\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1719019334\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1432315510\" class=\"local\">'Pain management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical options may be indicated in select cases.
