Many patients can even achieve sustained remission. The therapeutic approach has certain general principles, but it is highly individualized for each patient. It depends upon the age of the patient, the severity of the disease, particularly dictated by respiratory or bulbar involvement, and the pace of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>The chronic immunotherapies used in the treatment of MG will be reviewed here. The general approach to the treatment of MG and to common clinical situations in patients with MG is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four basic therapies used to treat myasthenia gravis (MG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70721 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic treatments: anticholinesterase agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic treatment'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic immunomodulating treatments: glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid immunomodulating treatments: plasma exchange and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Rapid immunotherapies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;, section on 'Rapid therapies'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment: thymectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Symptoms can be treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (also called anticholinesterase medications). These medications are all that is ever needed for some patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyridostigmine</a> bromide is the main cholinesterase inhibitor currently in use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic treatment'</a>.)</p><p>However, most patients with MG require some form of immunotherapy at some point in their illness, if not indefinitely. An immunomodulating agent is usually required for those patients who remain significantly symptomatic on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, or who become symptomatic again after a temporary response to pyridostigmine.</p><p>Balancing the improvement of MG symptoms with the side effects of the immunotherapeutic agents is always a challenge for the clinician and patient. Even when immunotherapeutic drugs are used, it is common to continue the use of anticholinesterase medications in order to reduce the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs and therefore minimize their adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOCORTICOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies and clinical experience support the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). Limited evidence from randomized, controlled trials likewise suggests that glucocorticoid treatment offers significant short-term benefit in MG compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The administration of moderate or high (1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) doses of glucocorticoids produces remission in about 30 percent of patients and marked improvement in another 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The onset of benefit generally begins within two to three weeks and peaks after a mean of 5.5 months.</p><p>Due to its rapid onset of action, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is usually recommended as initial therapy for most patients with MG who require chronic immunotherapy.</p><p>When high-dose glucocorticoids are started, up to 50 percent of patients develop a transient deterioration that can be serious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and up to 10 percent have respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The transient worsening usually occurs 5 to 10 days after the initiation of glucocorticoids and lasts about five or six days. For this reason, glucocorticoids are most often started in high doses only in hospitalized patients who are receiving concurrent plasmapheresis or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) for myasthenic crisis. These latter therapies have a quick onset of action that precludes the transient worsening of MG that would otherwise occur due to the glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;, section on 'Rapid therapies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose escalation and tapering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid the transient worsening that can occur early after starting high-dose glucocorticoids, an outpatient dose escalation regimen works quite effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is the preferred strategy for patients who do not have rapidly progressive symptoms, or those who do not have significant bulbar or respiratory symptoms. Patient with more severe exacerbations should be treated with plasma exchange or IVIG before starting corticosteroids.</p><p>There are several equally reasonable ways to start and then taper the dose. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> can be started at 20 mg daily and then increased by 5 mg every three to five days to the target dose of 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, which is usually around 50 to 80 mg daily (but no more than 100 mg daily). This often takes four to eight weeks. By that time, it is generally clear if there is a response to glucocorticoids. Tapering of the dose can then begin after a month or so at this dose. This can be individualized as well. If the patient has responded completely with resolution of the symptoms at a lower dose, then the dose does not need to go any higher. However, it is probably wise to hold the dose at that level for a month or so to be certain that the response is sustained, before beginning a tapering schedule.</p><p>Once an effective response is obtained, it is important not to taper the glucocorticoids too quickly, or else relapse is likely. Also, it should be remembered that worsening due to a reduction in dose would take at least two weeks.</p><p>Glucocorticoid tapering can be done with the final goal of achieving either a daily or alternate-day regimen. We use daily dosing of glucocorticoids in myasthenia gravis. However, there are no data to support the benefits of one over the other in myasthenia. Which of these regimens to choose is determined by the individual nature of the patient's medical health and the myasthenia. Daily dosing may be preferred for younger patients, those with little in the way of side effects, and patients with diabetes (to get a more even daily effect on blood sugars).</p><p>With either regimen, the daily dose may be reduced by 5 to 10 mg each month until below 30 mg, then more slowly thereafter (eg, 5 mg per month or slower). As an example, with the every other day regimen, the taper from 80 mg daily would begin with 80 mg alternating with 60 mg, then a month later to 80 mg alternating with 40 mg, and eventually to 80 mg alternating with 0 mg. Tapering of the high-dose day would then commence. It may be necessary to go back up to a higher dose by at least 10 to 20 mg if symptoms recur during the taper.</p><p>Many patients who respond to glucocorticoids can be effectively tapered down to approximately 10 mg per day (or 20 mg every other day) as a maintenance dose that keeps them minimally symptomatic. Young patients, in particular, tolerate such doses well with few of the side effects of these drugs. To avoid relapse, patients may need to stay on this maintenance dose for years, if not indefinitely. The relapse rate is not well defined.</p><p>Other immunosuppressive therapies are often combined with glucocorticoids. If the glucocorticoids cannot be tapered below a reasonably acceptable level without recurrence of symptoms, or if the patient does not respond satisfactorily, then other immunotherapeutic agents are usually needed, either to supplant the glucocorticoids or as a &quot;glucocorticoid-sparing&quot; agent. This is done to allow the use of lower doses of glucocorticoids, or none at all. Agents commonly used in combination with, or as a long-term replacement for, glucocorticoids are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-sparing agents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major disadvantages with chronic glucocorticoid use are their well-recognized side effects. Most are not specific to myasthenia and are dose and duration of treatment dependent. These commonly include weight gain, Cushingoid facies, easy bruising and skin fragility, cataracts, aseptic necrosis of the femoral or humeral heads, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be advised of the potential weight gain and provided an appropriate diet if necessary. Calcium (1500 mg per day) and vitamin D (400 to 800 IU per day) supplementation should be used to reduce bone mineral loss, especially in postmenopausal women. For those most at risk for osteoporosis, bone density should be measured at the start of treatment and then periodically. If bone mineral loss has occurred, patients are generally given a bisphosphonate or an alternative agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A histamine-2 blocker does not need to be used routinely, but it should be given in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or those who develop symptoms of gastritis. Blood pressure and serum glucose levels should be routinely monitored. Yearly checks for cataracts and glaucoma are also recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69890628\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulsed IV methylprednisolone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some have used pulsed intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (2 g over 12 hours) for exacerbations of MG, followed by 30 mg of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, and a case series suggested that there is a faster onset of action and less in the way of transient worsening than with oral prednisone alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One randomized, controlled trial showed that there was a marked improvement in patients with MG after only one pulse compared with placebo-treated patients and that the mean duration of improvement was eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOCORTICOID-SPARING AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic immunotherapies most commonly used for the long-term control of myasthenia gravis, and for glucocorticoid-sparing (steroid-sparing) effects, are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil.

The more rapidly acting glucocorticoid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) is started for short-term effect. As the glucocorticoids are tapered, usually after a few months, azathioprine can be started. The ultimate goal is to slowly withdraw the steroids entirely. However, this can take longer than a year to achieve.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a>, whether used alone or in combination with glucocorticoids, is begun at a dose of 50 mg daily for two to four weeks. If it is tolerated without systemic side effects, it can be increased by 50 mg increments every two to four weeks to a maintenance dose of 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> total body weight. In most patients, this is typically 150 to 200 mg each day. Monthly monitoring of complete blood counts and liver function studies is warranted for the first six months and then less frequently if stable.</p><p>Before starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, it is prudent to screen patients for mutations in the thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) gene that causes TPMT deficiency. One in 300 individuals are homozygous for a mutant allele and have very low or absent enzyme levels. These patients should not receive azathioprine because they cannot metabolize the drug and may develop life-threatening bone marrow suppression. Patients who are heterozygous for a mutant allele generally have low enzyme activity, but can tolerate azathioprine at lower than usual doses.

The initial flu-like illness is idiosyncratic and develops within the first few weeks of treatment. The drug should be discontinued in the patient, and the symptoms quickly abate.

Overall, clinical improvement lasted from five months to 7.5 years, and in seven patients the improvement lasted longer than one year.
