Allergy to shellfish is among the leading causes of food allergy in adults and the most common cause of food-allergic emergency department visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Several large studies have provided estimates of prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5-7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,10</a>]. One multinational survey of 17,280 adults (aged 20 to 44 years) from 15 countries questioned participants about foods that &quot;nearly always&quot; caused &quot;illness&quot; or &quot;trouble&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Shrimp, oysters, and fish were implicated by 2.3, 2.3, and 2.2 percent, respectively. In a random calling telephone survey in Canada, probable shellfish allergy was reported for 0.5 percent of children and 1.7 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The same study found rates of fish allergy to be 0.2 percent of children and 0.6 percent of adults.</p><p>Internationally, patterns of seafood consumption likely influence the prevalence of specific fish and shellfish allergies. As examples, allergy to whelk is seen in Korea, where this mollusk is a popular form of seafood, and barnacle allergy has been reported in the Portuguese population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A random calling survey in Singapore found a reported rate of shellfish allergy of 7.2 percent in 4- to 6-year-olds and 11.6 percent in 14- to 16-year-olds; applying features of a convincing history reduced these rates to 1.2 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, these rates are higher than similar studies from the United States and Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>An American study estimated the prevalence of seafood allergy using a nationwide cross-sectional telephone survey, in which a standardized questionnaire was administered to households chosen by randomly generated phone numbers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Criteria were established in advance to define seafood allergy by either a convincing history of symptoms (eg, urticaria, angioedema, trouble breathing, oral pruritus, or throat closing) or a diagnosis of allergy by a clinician. This study did not attempt to determine a rate of isolated gastrointestinal reactions to seafood. A total of 5529 households completed the survey (67.3 percent participation rate), representing a census of 14,948 individuals. Fish or shellfish allergy defined by established criteria was reported in 6 percent of households and among individuals as follows: 2.3 percent for any seafood allergy, 2 percent for shellfish, 0.4 percent for fish, and 0.2 percent for both fish and shellfish.</p><p>This study also revealed the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevalence rates in children were significantly lower than those in adults in all categories, as follows: any seafood allergy (0.6 versus 2.8 percent), shellfish (0.5 versus 2.5 percent), and fish (0.2 versus 0.5 percent). Boys were affected more often than girls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, the gender trend was reversed, and rates in females were significantly higher than in males for both shellfish allergy (2.6 versus 1.5 percent) and fish allergy (0.6 versus 0.2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The highest rates of seafood allergy were reported by African Americans, with shellfish reported as the leading cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common reported fish allergies, in order of decreasing frequency, were salmon, tuna, catfish, cod, flounder, halibut, trout, and bass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common reported shellfish allergies, in order of decreasing frequency, were shrimp, crab, lobster, clam, oyster, and mussel.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seafood allergy accounts for up to one-third of serious allergic reactions to food in patients referred for allergy evaluations.

Persons with seafood allergy may react to these <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other seafood proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parvalbumins are major allergens in fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Enolases, aldolases, and fish gelatin are also significant allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tropomyosins and sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein are major allergens in shrimp and possibly other shellfish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other allergens, including the muscle protein myosin light chain, are prominent allergens in shrimp. Several additional proteins (eg, arginine kinase and hemocyanin) are also present in other arthropods (ie, dust mites, cockroaches), accounting for cross-reactivity between these groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Cross-reactivity with non-food allergens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The pathogenesis of non-IgE-mediated seafood allergy is unclear. A syndrome that clinically resembles protein-induced enterocolitis has been described in both children and adults. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Non-IgE-mediated reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic reactions are the most commonly described type of allergic reactions to seafood ingestion. These may present as generalized reactions, asthmatic reactions in response to occupational or household exposures, or as food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis.</p><p>IgE-mediated reactions are rapid in onset (usually within minutes to one hour after ingestion), and extra gastrointestinal manifestations, such as urticaria, angioedema, respiratory symptoms, and laryngeal edema, are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>). These can range in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis; severe reactions are not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The clinical features of IgE-mediated reactions are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occupational and household exposures involving inhalation of cooking or processing vapors may cause asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis to seafood has also been reported. In this condition, the food causes symptoms only if ingestion is followed soon after by exercise or exertion but is tolerated in the absence of exertion. Wheat products and seafood are the two most frequently implicated foods in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated fish and shellfish allergies can vary from mild to severe. In the United States prevalence study, 60 to 70 percent of respondents experienced <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema,</span> and over one-half reported dyspnea or throat tightness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Consistent with this, approximately one-half of reactions prompted evaluation by a clinician or care in an emergency room. Despite the severe symptoms, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> was provided to only 16 percent of individuals treated in medical settings. In a retrospective chart review of 68 children with shrimp allergy from a referral center in Texas, the rate of anaphylaxis (compared with lesser reactions) was 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Several deaths from seafood allergy have been recorded. In a registry of food-induced fatal anaphylaxis comprised primarily of children, 1 of 32 deaths was due to fish, and in a report of 7 deaths, 1 was reported to crab and 1 to fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In a United Kingdom registry of fatalities from anaphylaxis, 3 of 33 fatalities to a known food were caused by seafood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several other reactions to seafood exposure that are not immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) in children, a non-IgE-mediated allergic reaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An enterocolitis-like reaction in adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact dermatitis in those with occupational and household skin exposure</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some regions, particularly Spain, fish is a prominent cause of FPIES in infants and young children. FPIES is a non-IgE-mediated form of food allergy that presents with profuse vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea several hours after ingestion of a given food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Infants and young children can present with a sepsis-like picture. Skin prick tests to the causative food are typically negative. FPIES in children is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Seafood may also cause an enterocolitis-like disorder in adults, with delayed onset of nausea, crampy abdominal pain, and protracted vomiting or diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>]. One severe case involved hypotension and blood-tinged diarrhea reproduced upon oral challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This appears to be primarily reported in response to mollusks. Adults typically present after having experienced this on several occasions, reporting that they had attributed the first one or two reactions to possible food poisoning. Indeed, these reactions clinically mimic diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), beginning one to six hours after ingestion and resolving within a few hours to three days, depending on severity. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The etiology of these enterocolitis-like reactions in adults is unclear. Their repeated occurrence in certain individuals suggests either that some persons are more susceptible to toxic components in these foods or that this reaction represents a form of allergy. There are very few studies of the pathogenesis of these reactions, although one study of adults with isolated gastrointestinal symptoms to various types of seafood included six patients who reacted repeatedly to oyster, in whom specific IgE was generally undetectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. No formal information about epidemiology, range of severity, or prognosis is available, and there are no data to guide informed recommendations about this type of reaction. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Delayed gastrointestinal reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergic contact dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic contact dermatitis can result from occupational skin exposure to seafood (eg, in food handlers or packers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/28,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,40</a>]. Disruption of the skin barrier has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of this condition in exposed workers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Age of onset and natural course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the American prevalence survey reviewed previously, allergy developed in adulthood for 40 and 60 percent of individuals with fish and shellfish allergy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Fifty-eight percent reported multiple reactions, with two to five episodes being typical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Fifteen to 20 percent of people experienced more than six reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Seafood allergy is considered to be persistent in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/35,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,41,42</a>]. In a study evaluating IgE binding to various epitopes of major shrimp allergens, children showed stronger and more diverse IgE binding than adults, implying the allergy may wane with time. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In the American telephone-based survey, only 3 to 4 percent of individuals with seafood allergy reported developing tolerance over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, loss of fish allergy during childhood or in adulthood has been reported, although the extent to which this occurs is not well-studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/42,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,44</a>]. Recurrence of fish allergy after tolerance has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A general discussion of the diagnosis of food allergy is presented elsewhere. A summary of this information, with a focus on those aspects that are most relevant to the diagnosis of seafood allergy, is provided below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of in vitro immunoassays for specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), other diagnostic allergy procedures, including skin testing and food challenges, should be performed by allergy specialists with training in the management of serious allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For suspected immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions, the history of an immediate reaction consisting of typical allergic symptoms supported by positive tests for specific IgE antibodies is sufficient to establish a diagnosis. Either skin prick tests or in vitro tests for IgE are usually performed initially. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The positive predictive value of skin prick testing with commercial seafood extracts and IgE immunoassays has not been compared with clinical reactivity in appropriate populations using oral food challenges. This is true for seafood and for most foods.</p><p>However, the negative predictive value of skin prick testing with commercial food extracts is generally high. In our clinic, we have found that negative skin tests with commercial seafood extracts that are in accordance with the clinical history are usually reliable. If there is uncertainty or the clinician has limited experience with a specific commercial extract, the actual food can be used for skin testing instead.</p><p>If the history is suggestive of allergy and one or both forms of testing are negative, then it is useful to repeat skin testing using the implicated seafood, prepared in a manner similar to the exposure that caused the reaction (eg, raw if sushi caused the reaction). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic pitfalls'</a> below.)</p><p>Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) refers to in vitro testing to determine if a patient's IgE binds to individual proteins within an allergenic food. Some CRD testing for allergenic proteins in seafood is commercially available, although these tests are not able to obviate the need for food challenge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-animal-derived-food-allergies#H12438221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for animal-derived food allergies&quot;, section on 'Shrimp'</a>.)</p><p>In each case of diagnosed seafood allergy, possible allergy to cross-reactive fish or shellfish must be addressed. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Cross-reactivity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Eating other seafood'</a> below.)</p><p>If the history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgE test results do not clearly indicate an allergy, then clinician-supervised oral food challenges would be required to exclude the diagnosis. The use of challenges in the diagnosis of food allergy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of suspected occupational asthma due to seafood allergy, which is also IgE-mediated, involves skin prick testing, pulmonary function testing, and possible bronchoprovocation challenge. Occupational asthma is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE tests are expected to be negative if the symptoms do not suggest an IgE-mediated reaction, such as delayed gastrointestinal reactions or contact dermatitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis can be confirmed by challenge in the case of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) in children, although this type of challenge can induce severe symptoms and is uncommonly performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of enterocolitis in adults would also require challenge, although patients who have experienced these reactions on several occasions may decline, understandably. Diagnosis based upon history alone is reasonable in cases of recurrent reactions, as this essentially rules out incidental poisoning or bacterial contamination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cases of contact dermatitis, patch testing with a preparation of the seafood in question may be informative, although such testing is not standardized.

Digestion, various processing methods <span class=\"nowrap\">(heating/canning),</span> and preparation issues (eg, which part of the fish is eaten) may influence the amount of relevant allergen in the final meal, as demonstrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies suggest that fish preparation methods (eg, boiling versus frying versus eating raw) may impact the allergenicity of fish in different ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Humans are accidental hosts who can become transiently infected as a result of eating the raw or undercooked flesh of infected fish (typically herring, hake, black plaice, and cod) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Deep freezing and rethawing of fish kills the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

This appeared to be the case in a report of seven children with atopic conditions who were sensitized to fish but had no clinical symptoms on ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. The children were placed on fish-elimination diets and followed prospectively. Within the ensuing two to five years, all of the children developed clinical allergy to fish, including two with anaphylaxis. Similar examples of this phenomenon exist for other foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Possible reasons for the heightened sensitivity include both lack of exposure and the opposite explanation, namely, ongoing low level exposure (through hidden sources or cross-contact).</p><p>Thus, if a patient with allergy to a certain fish or shellfish wishes to continue eating other forms of seafood, the clinician's recommendations must carefully balance the patient's preferences with what is known about cross-reactivity among seafood. The severity of the patient's reaction also influences the decision. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Cross-reactivity'</a> above.)</p><p>The following scenarios illustrate some of the issues involved and our management approach. Individual clinicians may decide to adopt different strategies depending upon their level of expertise and the resources available (eg, ability to perform oral food challenges).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have experienced life-threatening anaphylaxis to a specific shellfish, we advise avoidance of all shellfish, largely because of the higher chance of encountering a cross-reactive tropomyosin in these foods. Similarly, a person who reacted to one finned fish would usually be advised to avoid all finned fish. We typically do <strong>not</strong> advise patients with serious reactions to shellfish to avoid finned fish (or vice versa), since the major allergens in shellfish and finned fish are different. However, patients must be wary of settings in which cross-contamination is common, such as seafood restaurants. It may be wise to avoid these settings altogether.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with non-life-threatening reactions, we are more flexible in our approach. If patients are content to avoid all shellfish or finned fish (depending upon which group they reacted to), we do not discourage this approach. However, if a patient wishes to continue to include similar seafood in the diet, then a careful evaluation must be performed to determine which specific foods may be safely eaten. As an example, a patient who developed an allergy to codfish that is moderate in severity and has been avoiding all seafood for several months may ask about the safety of eating tuna, which had been a regular component of the patient's diet before the reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In this case, we would first perform skin testing with commercial extracts of tuna. If negative, we would allow the ingestion of tuna because the experience in our clinic suggests the negative predictive value of skin prick testing for seafoods is generally high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, if there was any clinical suspicion of tuna allergy or if the clinician was uncomfortable proceeding without additional evaluation, skin testing and oral food challenge with fresh tuna should be performed. If skin tests were positive to tuna but the patient still had a strong interest in eating it, we would perform a cautious graded challenge to determine whether there was true clinical reactivity (because false-positive skin tests are not uncommon).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We allow persons to continue to eat seafood that has not caused symptoms in the recent past and which they have eaten regularly (similar to having just passed an oral food challenge). As an example, a patient with a newly diagnosed allergy to codfish who continued to eat tuna without incident after the reaction can simply continue to do so.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698844487\"><span class=\"h3\">Eating only certain forms of the food in question</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who react to fresh tuna and salmon will often tolerate canned versions of these fish, presumably because of modification of allergens during processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. If an individual has reacted to fresh tuna or salmon and is interested in eating the canned form, we suggest prick-by-prick testing and oral food challenge with the canned fish be performed to ensure the patient tolerates it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of reactions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of individuals with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated seafood allergy is important because these reactions can be severe. As in other forms of food allergy, the severity of symptoms in a given individual may vary dramatically between reactions, and the severity of an initial reaction should not be used to predict the patient's subsequent risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. Accordingly, all individuals diagnosed with IgE-mediated seafood allergy should have an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector(s) available at all times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].

Fish is a common cause of food allergy in children, although rates of seafood allergy are lower than in adults. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifestations of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated seafood allergy include <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis,</span> occupational asthma, and food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis. IgE-mediated seafood allergy can be severe and is usually long-lasting. There are also non-IgE-mediated forms of allergy that present with delayed gastrointestinal reactions, although limited data are available about these reactions. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parvalbumins in fish and tropomyosins in shellfish are the proteins that are responsible for the majority of IgE-mediated allergies. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of IgE-mediated seafood allergy is based upon a careful history supported by skin prick tests or in vitro tests for specific IgE. Positive tests for food-specific IgE may be present to seafood that is clinically tolerated, and a supervised oral food challenge may be necessary for definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several factors may alter the allergenicity of seafood and complicate diagnosis, including preparation method, changes as a result of digestion, and the specific part of the fish that is consumed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65968\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65968 \">table 2</a>). The differential diagnosis includes allergy to seafood parasites and nonallergic reactions to toxins in seafood. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic pitfalls'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of clinical cross-reactivity to different types of seafood within a group are high (ie, a person allergic to one fish is likely to react to others). In contrast, a minority (about 10 percent) of those allergic to any seafood are allergic to both fish and shellfish, although this observation is based on limited data. Because false-positives on skin testing are possible, supervised challenge may be needed to definitely determine if a patient reacts to a specific seafood. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Cross-reactivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of seafood allergies includes instructions about avoidance of the specific culprit food, evaluations for reactivity to related foods in patients who wish to continue eating seafood, and education in the proper management of accidental exposures. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with life-threatening reactions are generally advised to avoid all related seafood. Some patients will choose to avoid all seafood to minimize the risk of exposure through cross-contact. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with less severe reactions, some may wish to continue eating other forms of seafood in the future. In this case, testing and possibly oral challenges are needed to determine which specific foods are tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Eating other seafood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with IgE-mediated reactions to fish or shellfish should be equipped with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors, regardless of the severity of their initial reactions.
