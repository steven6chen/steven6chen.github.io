In addition, guidelines have been published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and a European consensus group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In the immediate postoperative period, complete clinicopathologic findings may be unavailable to fully estimate these risks, and the clinician may need to modify dosing four to six weeks postoperatively.

They can be performed when the extent of residual disease cannot be determined from surgery and neck ultrasonography and when the presence of residual disease may alter the decision to treat with radioiodine or the administered activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, because almost all patients have thyroid remnants, our approach is to omit the pre-radioiodine treatment diagnostic scan, administer empiric therapeutic doses of iodine-131 (131-I) therapy (based upon surgical and ultrasonography findings), and obtain only a post-radioiodine treatment scan for localization of uptake. (See <a href=\"#H3438702415\" class=\"local\">'Radioiodine therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Radioiodine treatment&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment scanning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2272967712\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinicopathologic features of each case are important for providing prognostic information. Since the TNM (Tumor Node Metastasis) staging system is designed to stratify risk based upon disease-specific mortality and may not accurately predict the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">recurrence/persistent</span> disease in thyroid cancer, we use TNM staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 2</a>) to estimate mortality and the ATA risk stratification system to estimate the risk of recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Staging is reviewed briefly below and in more detail separately.

The risk of recurrence, however, follows a continuum across the three discrete risk categories (low, intermediate, and high). Additional prognostic variables (eg, extent of lymph node involvement, degree of vascular invasion in follicular thyroid cancer) were included in a modified version of the risk stratification system, although the additional variables have not been rigorously evaluated.
