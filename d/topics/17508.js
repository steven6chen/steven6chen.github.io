Men with clinically significant lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) suggestive of BPH who do not find adequate relief with medical treatment may benefit from transurethral resection or ablation to enlarge the urethral channel to reduce the amount of prostate tissue around the urethra. Surgery also may be indicated for urinary retention, bladder stone formation, recurrent urinary tract infections, or upper urinary tract deterioration. </p><p>Most procedures are performed via the urethra (ie, transurethral) using a cystoscope. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the main form of treatment for many years in men with BPH and remains the standard against which other treatments should be compared. Most men who undergo TURP experience a marked decrease in urinary symptom scores and a substantial increase in maximal urinary flow rates. However, the complications and cost associated with TURP have encouraged development of several alternative methods to remove or destroy prostatic tissue using a variety of energy sources. </p><p>Transurethral procedures for resection or ablation of prostate tissue and other therapies for the treatment of BPH will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and management of BPH are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376676258\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign prostate enlargement is the physical enlargement of the prostate gland that is due to histologic changes known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Bladder outlet obstruction due to BPH is frequently diagnosed clinically on the basis of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) that can present acutely, or, more often, chronically. A decision to treat BPH is usually based upon the severity of symptoms determined by either the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) or the International Prostate Symptom Score (I&ndash;PSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57680 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], which are very similar. In general, symptoms only require therapy if they have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Whether to proceed to surgical intervention is generally based upon the adequacy of medical therapy, the development of complications, and patient preference, rather than any specific urological parameter. The medical treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>General indications for surgical intervention include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery offers the most effective resolution of bladder outlet obstruction symptoms of the lower urinary tract suggestive of BPH and can be offered to patients with moderate-to-severe chronic symptoms who are bothered by their symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H376676270\" class=\"local\">'Chronic lower urinary tract symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is generally recommended for patients with symptoms of acute urinary retention that are refractory to medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H376676276\" class=\"local\">'Acute urinary retention'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is also the treatment of choice for patients who have renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, whether due to acute urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction on urodynamic evaluation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a median lobe configuration are unlikely to respond to medical therapy and should also preferentially be treated surgically. A median lobe configuration represents a lobe of hyperplastic tissue that protrudes into the lumen of the bladder, producing a mechanical obstruction to urine flow by occluding the bladder neck like a valve each time the bladder contracts during voiding. For patients who fail medical therapy, we suggest prostate imaging, either using transrectal ultrasound or by direct visualization (ie, cystoscopy) to evaluate the patient's anatomy. (See <a href=\"#H376677020\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy of the prostate'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376676270\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic lower urinary tract symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower urinary tract symptoms include increased frequency of urination, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency, and weak urinary stream. These symptoms typically appear slowly and gradually progress over a period of years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower urinary tract symptoms in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, these symptoms require treatment only if they have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. For men with moderate symptoms, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may be more effective compared with watchful waiting, but watchful waiting is still a reasonable alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Watchful waiting may be the best alternative for men with significant medical comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H376681963\" class=\"local\">'Outcome comparisons'</a> below.)</p><p>Surgical intervention is indicated if bladder outlet obstruction is creating a risk for upper tract injury such as hydronephrosis or renal insufficiency, or lower tract complications such as urinary retention, recurrent infection, or bladder decompensation (eg, low-pressure detrusor contractions, post-void residuals of &gt;25 percent of total bladder volume) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most patients who develop complications will require treatment, as will patients who develop bladder calculi or persistent gross hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376676276\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute urinary retention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BPH is a common cause of acute urinary retention in older men. Catheterization is the initial treatment, but subsequent treatment varies. Although some urologists continue to favor surgery for men with acute urinary retention due to BPH, most suggest a trial of catheter drainage combined with alpha blockers, and cessation of any anticholinergic agents or opiates, followed by a voiding trial. For patients with acute urinary retention who subsequently fail a voiding trial one or more times, we suggest transurethral resection of the prostate (bipolar TURP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;, section on 'Surgical therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention#H73274109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;, section on 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia'</a>.) </p><p>Many men who are able to void successfully after removal of the catheter eventually have recurrent urinary retention. As an example, in one study of 228 men, 56 percent had a recurrence within one week after the initial episode and 68 percent within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Factors predictive of recurrence included a retained volume &gt;500 mL and a maximum flow rate of &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> after the episode of retention. Another important stratification of the risk for recurrent acute urinary retention is whether or not the episode was spontaneous or precipitated by some other event (eg, unrelated surgery, opioids, cold medication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The risk of developing acute urinary retention in men with BPH depends upon the population studied. In one report of more than 3000 men with BPH who were randomized to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> or placebo, the risk of needing surgery for BPH or developing acute urinary retention over four years was 4 percent in the finasteride and 7 percent in the placebo group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81016\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81016 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this study, the baseline serum prostate specific antigen concentration and prostate volume were the best predictors of the development of acute urinary retention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376676207\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1087585699\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), we obtain both free and total serum prostate specific antigen, a serum creatinine, and urinalysis and culture to exclude a urinary tract infection. If infection is present, it should be treated prior to surgery. </p><p>We also obtain a transrectal prostate ultrasound to assess the size and configuration of the prostate, as well as a renal ultrasound to assess the kidneys. Although the American Urological Association guidelines on diagnostic evaluation of patients with BPH do not recommend routine prostate or renal ultrasound, the guidelines do acknowledge that such studies could be useful in select patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (including BPH) is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Appropriate antibiotic choices are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87199 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376676756\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-third of patients requiring a transurethral procedure for BPH are taking some form of antithrombotic therapy (eg, Vitamin K antagonist, antiplatelet agents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The management of patients on antithrombotic therapy undergoing a transurethral procedure to manage BPH continues to evolve. Because of the risk of perioperative bleeding associated with TURP, bridging anticoagulation (intravenous heparin, low molecular-weight heparin) or temporary cessation of therapy is generally used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A decision to withhold antithrombotic therapy needs to consider the relative risk of a significant adverse cardiovascular event versus the risk of bleeding. Lower bleeding rates associated with non-TURP procedures may influence the choice of procedure in patients for whom the risks of altering the anticoagulation regimen are deemed too high. (See <a href=\"#H664264162\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> below.) </p><p>The details of perioperative <span class=\"nowrap\">antiplatelet/anticoagulation</span> management are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In one large multicenter study, the outcomes of TURP in patients on antithrombotic therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in 33 percent, antiplatelet agents in 23 percent, and combined in 1.5 percent) were compared with those with no antithrombotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Bridging anticoagulation was used in 76 percent of patients on chronic warfarin therapy. Patients in the antithrombotic therapy group had significantly higher rates of bladder clots (13 versus 4.7 percent), transfusion (1.9 versus 1.0 percent), late hematuria (15.0 versus 8.4 percent), and thromboembolic events (2.4 versus 0.7 percent), and a significantly longer duration of hospitalization (6.4 versus 4.7 days). Patients on antithrombotic therapy were significantly older (75 versus 71 years), had significantly larger prostate volume (56 versus 49 mL), and had a significantly higher rate of bladder catheterization prior to surgery (26 versus 17 percent). In contrast, a retrospective review of 305 patients did not find significant differences in postoperative bleeding rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this study, the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage (early &lt;14 days, and delayed &ge;14 days) was not significantly different between those in whom anticoagulants were ceased preoperatively and then resumed postoperatively (generally within three to five days after TURP), and those not receiving any anticoagulants <span class=\"nowrap\">(10/108</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">16/194)</span>. The overall rate of cardiovascular events was low (&lt;1 percent) and not significantly different between the groups.</p><p>Two studies using non-TURP resection or ablation procedures (eg, holmium laser enucleation of the prostate [HoLEP], photoselective vaporization [PVP]) found no significant differences in bleeding comparing patients who were, or were not, on antithrombotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Compared with TURP, non-TURP procedures are generally associated with lower bleeding rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. One small study compared the bleeding rates between TURP (n = 57) and plasma vaporization (n = 54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients treated with plasma vaporization required less bladder washout (2 versus 18 percent) and had a lower incidence of late hematuria (4 versus 19 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376676973\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to proceeding, the patient should be informed about potential complications, including alterations in sexual function.

The prostate is composed of both glandular and muscular tissue. Secretions from the prostate, vas deferens, and seminal vesicle empty into the prostatic urethra (ie, section of the urethra that traverses the prostate); each of these structures contributes to the composition of the semen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54803\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54803 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The prostate gland is divided into three general zones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57801 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral &ndash; Approximately 70 percent of the normal prostate gland is contained within the peripheral zone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central &ndash; The central zone comprises 25 percent of the volume of the normal prostate.

Because the resection is limited to the area between the bladder neck and the verumontanum, the ejaculatory ducts should not be affected; however, they can be injured, which can lead to discomfort during orgasm.

However, the popularity of monopolar TURP has waned since 2000 due to the emergence of alternative techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>At our institution, bipolar TURP and plasma vaporization (ie, the &quot;button&quot; procedure) have largely replaced traditional monopolar TURP, and we anticipate that bipolar TURP will replace monopolar TURP in the near future. (See <a href=\"#H367258155\" class=\"local\">'Bipolar TURP'</a> below and <a href=\"#H367258685\" class=\"local\">'Plasma vaporization (&quot;button&quot; procedure)'</a> below.)</p><p>Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) using monopolar electrocautery is the standard procedure used for treating BPH. It can be performed under general anesthesia, neuraxial anesthesia (spinal, epidural), or regional nerve block. The procedure takes approximately 60 to 90 minutes to perform and generally requires a 24 hour postoperative observation period in the hospital due to the need to monitor the patient for bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrolyte abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H376678940\" class=\"local\">'Postprostatectomy syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>For a monopolar TURP, the resectoscope, which is loaded with a monopolar diathermy loop, is introduced into the bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72119\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72119 \">figure 4</a>). Continuous irrigation using a nonconductive solution (eg, 1.5% glycine in sterile water, mix of 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> plus 0.54% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>) is used to distend the bladder and to wash away blood and prostate tissue fragments. Under direct vision, strips of prostate tissue are resected one at a time and placed temporarily into the bladder. The resection is continued until the entire region of hyperplasia (ie, adenoma) is resected. Once the resection is completed, the prostate chips are evacuated from the bladder and bleeding is controlled using electrocautery. The prostatic fossa is left wide open, bounded by its capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58306 \">figure 5</a>). The cavity will be lined by a regenerated epithelial surface in 4 to 12 weeks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367258155\"><span class=\"h2\">Bipolar TURP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bipolar TURP uses bipolar electrocautery instead of the monopolar electrocautery used with the standard TURP procedure described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In contrast to standard TURP, saline can be used as an irrigant (also known as TUR in saline), eliminating the risk of hyponatremia (ie, postprostatectomy syndrome). The advantages of bipolar electrocautery are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;, section on 'Bipolar electrosurgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367258685\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma vaporization (&quot;button&quot; procedure)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma vaporization uses bipolar electrocautery similar to bipolar TURP described above. High-frequency electric current passing between two electrodes creates the resection &quot;loop,&quot; which vaporizes the prostate tissue with minimal blood loss. It has the advantage of not causing sloughing of the tissue and is associated with less blood loss than TURP. In contrast to monopolar and bipolar TURP, no prostate tissue is available for pathological analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

TUIP can be performed under general anesthesia or with a regional block and generally requires a 24-hour observation period in the hospital. The resectoscope is loaded with monopolar or bipolar electrocautery and introduced into the bladder under direct vision. Traditionally, glycine was used as an irrigating solution; however, saline is more commonly used. Usually, two deep incisions are made starting distal to each ureteral orifice and proceeding in a retrograde fashion through the bladder neck and the prostatic adenoma distally toward the verumontanum of the prostate.

A <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> technique has also been described. Given the emerging technologies described above (bipolar TURP, PVP, HoLEP, ThuLEP), it is likely that the use of open prostatectomy will continue to diminish with time.

A study comparing laparoscopic prostatectomy with historical controls who received open prostatectomy concluded that the procedures have similar efficacy and that the laparoscopic procedure required longer operating room time but led to a shorter hospital stay and less blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>In some studies, open prostatectomy had lower complication and mortality rates than TURP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], but the difference probably relates to patient selection for the procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. </p><p>In a prospective study of 902 men in Germany who underwent open prostatectomy (mean prostate size 96 mL; baseline IPSS 20.7), the mortality rate was 0.7 percent and the complication rate was 17 percent, with 7.5 percent requiring transfusion, 5.1 percent treatment for urinary tract infection, and 3.7 percent reoperation for severe bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

For most men who require an invasive procedure to treat BPH, we suggest transurethral resection of the prostate (bipolar TURP), which is effective at reducing symptoms and avoids the need for repeat treatment. At our institution, bipolar TURP (along with plasma vaporization [ie, the &quot;button&quot; procedure]) has largely overtaken traditional monopolar TURP, and we speculate that bipolar TURP will completely replace monopolar TURP in the near future. Our recommendation places a relatively higher value on reducing symptoms and avoiding repeat treatment for <span class=\"nowrap\">BPH/lower</span> urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) and a relatively lower value on shortening length of stay and avoiding postoperative blood transfusions. Patients with a large prostate gland, and those with significant medical risk factors, might reasonably choose an alternative procedure. </p><p>Options under individual circumstances may include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large prostate &ndash; Monopolar or bipolar TURP, laser enucleation (holmium laser enucleation of the prostate [HoLEP], thulium laser enucleation of the prostate [ThuLEP]), plasma vaporization (ie, &quot;button&quot;), open prostatectomy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulated patient &ndash; Photoselective vaporization (PVP), radiofrequency ablation (see <a href=\"#H376676756\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk medical patient &ndash; PVP, radiofrequency ablation, transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder outlet obstruction, small prostate &ndash; TUIP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with small- to moderate-sized prostates who seek to preserve normal ejaculation &ndash; TUIP, radiofrequency ablation, transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), or prostatic urethral lift (PUL). </p><p/><p>Non-TURP procedures such as transurethral enucleation (HoLEP, ThuLEP), plasma vaporization (&quot;button&quot;), and PVP are becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of BPH because they are associated with less blood loss compared with TURP (monopolar), avoid hyponatremia, and can often be performed as a day procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/21,22,98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,98,99</a>]. Although there are as yet no long-term data on their efficacy, it is anticipated that results will be comparable to standard TURP. PVP is a particularly good option for men who are not good candidates for TURP, but less prostatic tissue is removed with PVP. We continue to prefer TURP to PVP in good risk patients with moderate-to-large prostates. (See <a href=\"#H2344313\" class=\"local\">'Transurethral procedures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H376681963\" class=\"local\">'Outcome comparisons'</a> above.) </p><p>Microwave thermotherapy (eg, TUMT) is an effective alternative to TURP for treating small- to moderate-sized prostates in men with BPH who do not have a history of urinary retention or prior prostate procedures. </p><p>Radiofrequency ablation of the prostate is an alternative for men who are poor candidates for surgery, particularly men who require anticoagulation, but also for those who wish to undergo a procedure with fewer lower urinary and sexual side effects than TURP. The improvements in urodynamic and symptom score parameters are generally inferior to TURP or vaporization procedures; however, radiofrequency ablation can be repeated, or a more invasive procedure can be performed subsequently, if needed. Radiofrequency ablation should not be used in patients on the verge of urinary retention or in patients with deteriorating renal function caused by obstructive uropathy. (See <a href=\"#H376681963\" class=\"local\">'Outcome comparisons'</a> above.)</p><p>Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) may be useful for men with bladder outlet obstruction and relatively little prostate enlargement, particularly men with medical comorbidities. Similar to transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), TURP provides greater improvements in urinary symptom scores and flow improvements than TUIP and reduces the need for subsequent BPH treatments. (See <a href=\"#H376681963\" class=\"local\">'Outcome comparisons'</a> above.)</p><p>Four procedures (TUIP, radiofrequency ablation, TUMT, and PUL) may be better suited for patients who seek to preserve normal ejaculatory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. These procedures cause significantly less retrograde ejaculation than resectional procedures such as TURP, laser enucleation, or PVP. However, patients should be advised that these four procedures are generally used to treat a smaller prostate volume, and that more reoperations may be required in patients who develop recurrent LUTSs.

Men with BPH who are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms may not require treatment. Those with more severe urinary symptoms may benefit from medical therapy and will improve or stabilize without the need for surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, men who develop upper tract injury (eg, hydronephrosis, renal dysfunction) or lower tract injury (eg, urinary retention, recurrent infection, bladder decompensation) require invasive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H376676258\" class=\"local\">'Indications for Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most procedures used in the treatment of BPH are performed transurethrally. Prostatic tissue can be removed (ie, resected) or destroyed (ie, ablated) using a variety of techniques, which include transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral laser enucleation (holmium laser enucleation of the prostate [HoLEP], thulium laser enucleation of the prostate [ThuLEP]), plasma vaporization (the &quot;button&quot; procedure), photoselective vaporization (PVP), radiofrequency ablation, microwave thermotherapy, transurethral incision (TUIP), and convective water vapor energy (WAVE) ablation. Other procedures include the prostatic lift and injection of botulinum toxin. (See <a href=\"#H2344313\" class=\"local\">'Transurethral procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most men undergoing TURP experience a marked decrease in urinary symptom score and a substantial increase in maximal urinary flow rates. Non-TURP procedures that remove a sufficient quantity of prostate tissue have early results that are comparable to TURP. The level of urinary improvement is not as good as TURP for radiofrequency ablation and incision procedures, and retreatment is common. Data on long-term outcomes are limited for most procedures. (See <a href=\"#H376681963\" class=\"local\">'Outcome comparisons'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men who require an invasive procedure and are in good health, we suggest transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We use bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (bipolar TURP), or bipolar plasma vaporization of the prostate (&quot;button&quot; procedure), rather than traditional monopolar TURP. Urologic symptom improvements using bipolar TURP or vaporization are comparable to monopolar TURP, but bipolar procedures have a better safety profile. Where expertise and equipment are available, laser photoselective vaporization (PVP) is an alternative that will likely produce similar outcomes. Alternative procedures may be chosen under selected circumstances (eg, medical comorbidities, anticoagulation, avoidance of side effects). (See <a href=\"#H664264162\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications associated with transurethral procedures include bleeding, postprostatectomy syndrome, erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, urethral stricture, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence. Technical modifications involving the use of bipolar instead of monopolar electrocautery, and the use of other forms of transurethral resection and ablation of prostate tissue, have generally lowered complication rates. (See <a href=\"#H376678934\" class=\"local\">'Periprocedural morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Barry MJ, Fowler FJ Jr, O'Leary MP, et al.
