(See <a href=\"#H126131023\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of benefit from treating hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p>Our proposed blood pressure targets depend in part upon the method by which the blood pressure is measured. The ausculatory method of measurement using a manual cuff is the most common technique employed in clinical practice and, in addition, was the technique used in most clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy. By contrast, automated oscillometric blood pressure (AOBP), using a device that can average multiple consecutive readings with the patient resting alone in a room, is less frequently employed in clinical practice but was the technique that was used in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). In general, systolic pressure readings are 5 to 10 mmHg lower with AOBP than with manual (ausculatory) measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].

This is the goal if manual (ausculatory) blood pressure is measured, but the goal is lower (systolic pressure of &lt;130 to 135 mmHg) if AOBP is measured. This goal is generally consistent with recommendations from major societies and organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/1,2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7-9</a>].</p><p/><p>However, those who are frail, those older than 80 years, and those with low diastolic pressures (&lt;70 mmHg using manual [ausculatory] measurements) may be more likely to develop significant side effects with blood pressure lowering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, some older patients are unable to achieve even a systolic blood pressure of &lt;140 mmHg; in such patients, targeting a systolic pressure of &lt;150 mmHg is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>These blood pressure targets also apply to older adults with isolated systolic hypertension. However, the diastolic blood pressure should be reduced to a minimum post-treatment value of &gt;60 mmHg overall or perhaps &gt;65 mmHg in patients with known coronary artery disease unless symptoms that could be attributable to hypoperfusion occur already at higher diastolic pressures. In many cases, the level of systolic blood pressure that is reached with two or three antihypertensive agents (even if greater than 140 mmHg) may be a more reasonable <strong>interim</strong> goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In these cases, lower blood pressure levels may be accepted to permit sufficient drug doses.</p><p>The above recommendations and suggestions assume that the blood pressure is being accurately measured. They also assume that the blood pressure is being gradually reduced since acute lowering of the blood pressure in patients with severe underlying hypertension can lead to deleterious cerebrovascular and coronary events. When blood pressure is measured to assess control, whether in the clinic or at home, an average of multiple measurements provides a more accurate assessment of blood pressure control than single measurements.

The risk is greater for each increment in systolic pressure than for the equivalent increase in diastolic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals over age 65 years, the risk continues to increase with the rising systolic pressure. However, a reversal occurs with the diastolic pressure: the lower the diastolic pressure at a given systolic pressure, the greater the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, an increased pulse pressure is associated with an increased risk of an adverse event.</p><p/><p>The relative prognostic importance of the different blood pressure components in individuals of different ages was perhaps best studied among participants in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this cohort study of 7830 participants between the ages of 30 and 74 years who were initially free of cardiovascular disease, the baseline blood pressure was correlated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality over a 15-year follow-up. Over this period, 1588 patients died, with cardiovascular disease being responsible in 582 (37 percent).</p><p>Unlike previous studies, the analysis was based upon a generalized additive risk model that utilized the correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressures to estimate the risk for different baseline blood pressure combinations. As a result, the risk associated with a blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">150/100</span> mmHg could be ascertained, whereas other studies permitted determination of the risk of a systolic pressure of 150 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of 100 mmHg, but not the combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the latter studies, the risk attributed to a diastolic pressure of 100 mmHg was a composite of the range of systolic pressures associated with this diastolic pressure.</p><p>The following results were obtained concerning mortality beyond the first two years of follow-up:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among participants less than 65 years of age, increases in the systolic blood pressure were linearly related to increases in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality at <strong>all</strong> diastolic blood pressure levels. By comparison, the correlation between diastolic blood pressure and mortality in this age group was &quot;hockey stick-shaped.&quot; This shape corresponds to a flat region of risk with diastolic values below 80 mmHg and a marked increase in risk occurring with values above this level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those greater than 65 years of age, increases in the systolic pressure were also linearly related to increased mortality at all diastolic pressures. However, the risk with the diastolic pressure was J-shaped; thus, for a fixed systolic pressure, increasing diastolic pressure that was below approximately 80 to 90 mmHg was associated with a decreased risk of mortality, while increasing diastolic pressure above 80 to 90 mmHg was associated with an enhanced risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased pulse pressure was associated with marked variations in risk of mortality, depending upon age, and the exact systolic and diastolic pressures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126131023\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT FROM TREATING HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to keep in mind that there is a meaningful difference between goal blood pressure and achieved blood pressure. Many trials have demonstrated that lower <strong>achieved</strong> blood pressure is associated with superior outcomes. As an example, a meta-analysis of 123 randomized trials of antihypertensive therapy including 613,815 patients found that a 10 mmHg reduction in achieved systolic pressure reduced the risks of death (relative risk [RR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.91), coronary heart disease (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.88), stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.77), and heart failure (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.67-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The benefit from blood pressure reduction was present regardless of the baseline blood pressure (including in patients whose initial systolic pressure was less than 130 mmHg). In addition, patients with both low initial systolic pressure and preexisting cardiovascular disease benefited from lower blood pressure, suggesting the absence of a J-curve.</p><p>By contrast, comparatively fewer trials have directly evaluated two different <strong>goal</strong> (ie, target) blood pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. A separate meta-analysis of goal blood pressure trials (ie, comparing a more intensive versus a less intensive goal) included 16 trials (including the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial [SPRINT] trial, discussed below) and 52,235 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Nonsignificant relative risk reductions were found for heart failure (0.80, 95% CI 0.49-1.31) and all-cause mortality (0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.03).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative risk reductions were similar regardless of the cardiovascular risk at baseline (ie, patients whose estimated five-year risk of having an event was &lt;5 percent had the same relative benefit from blood pressure lowering as those whose five-year event risk was &gt;10 percent). However, absolute benefits from blood pressure lowering were greater among patients who were high risk at baseline. In patients whose baseline five-year cardiovascular risk was estimated to be &gt;10 percent, for example, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure in 1000 patients over five years prevented 66 strokes, 94 coronary heart disease events, 31 heart failure events, and 128 deaths (including 75 from cardiovascular disease). By contrast, in low-risk patients (ie, those with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk of &lt;5 percent), a similar blood pressure reduction in 1000 patients over five years prevented only four strokes, four coronary heart disease events, and four deaths; none of these absolute risk reductions in low-risk patients were statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Systolic and diastolic hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitions of systolic and diastolic hypertension depend upon the method used to measure the blood pressure.

Thus, the rate of adverse events reported in SPRINT may be an underestimate of the adverse event rate that would be seen with intensive treatment in routine practice. In addition, patients in routine practice may require more antihypertensive medications than participants in SPRINT (the average was three in the intensive treatment group, and approximately one-fourth required four or more medications), and this could increase risk of adverse events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure in SPRINT was measured using AOBP, which corresponds more closely with mean daytime blood pressure (using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring) than with the manual (ausculatory) blood pressure measurements that are routinely performed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Technique of measurement'</a>). Ausculatory systolic pressure measurements are usually higher than AOBP measurements (by 5 to 10 mmHg). Thus, if clinicians use routine ausculatory blood pressure measurement (the most common method in clinical practice) rather than AOBP measurement, then targeting a systolic pressure of &lt;120 mmHg is likely to increase the risk of serious adverse events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients enrolled in SPRINT had diastolic pressures greater than 70 mmHg at baseline, and these pressures remained above 65 mmHg during the course of the trial, even in the intensive treatment group.

Treatment was begun with the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a> (5 mg once a day). Either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or beta-blocker was added if the target pressure was not obtained with initial therapy.

The respective mean systolic blood pressures were 144, 141, and 140 mmHg. This close degree of blood pressure reduction among the three groups fails to provide the power to detect any difference in protection with varying degrees of blood pressure lowering.

Although this adverse effect may be due to chance, support for its validity includes the large number of smokers studied (nearly 3000 patients); the fact that smoking-stratification was included in the randomization; and the fact that no baseline differences in characteristics were noted among smokers in the three randomized categories.

Many trials have demonstrated that lower <strong>achieved</strong> blood pressure is associated with superior outcomes, while comparatively few trials have directly evaluated two different <strong>goal</strong> (ie, target) blood pressures. (See <a href=\"#H126131023\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of benefit from treating hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefit in patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension that was most pronounced in severe and moderate disease. Although the number of patients was small in the severe and moderate hypertension trials, the magnitude of benefit was extremely high. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Benefit according to severity of hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the degree of blood pressure elevation, the magnitude of absolute benefit from antihypertensive therapy depends upon the presence or absence of other cardiovascular risk factors and, therefore, the overall cardiovascular risk. Patients with higher baseline cardiovascular risk derive greater absolute benefit from blood pressure lowering (ie, the number needed to treat to prevent one cardiovascular event is smaller than in patients with low baseline cardiovascular risk). (See <a href=\"#H479320743\" class=\"local\">'Benefit according to overall cardiovascular risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our proposed <strong>blood pressure targets depend in part upon the method by which the blood pressure is measured</strong>. The ausculatory method of measurement using a manual cuff is the most common technique employed in clinical practice and, in addition, was the technique used in most clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy. By contrast, automated oscillometric blood pressure (AOBP), using a device that can average multiple consecutive readings with the patient resting alone in a room, is less frequently employed in clinical practice but was the technique that was used in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). In general, systolic pressure readings are 5 to 10 mmHg lower with AOBP than with manual (ausculatory) measurement. (See <a href=\"#H126130858\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to goal blood pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We propose the following blood pressure goals in patients with hypertension (see <a href=\"#H126130858\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to goal blood pressure'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Goal blood pressure for patients who are similar to the SPRINT population</strong> &ndash; SPRINT enrolled patients aged 50 years or older who had a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 180 mmHg plus one or more of the following additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease: age greater than or equal to 75 years; clinically evident cardiovascular disease (ie, previously documented coronary, peripheral arterial, or cerebrovascular disease [except for stroke]); subclinical cardiovascular disease (ie, an elevated coronary artery calcification score by computerized tomography scan, left ventricular hypertrophy, or an ankle-brachial index &lt;0.9); an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>; or a 10-year Framingham Risk Score greater than or equal to 15 percent.

In addition, when treating older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the diastolic blood pressure should be reduced to a minimum post-treatment value of &gt;60 mmHg. In many cases, the level of systolic blood pressure that is reached with two or three antihypertensive agents (even if greater than 140 mmHg) may be a more reasonable interim goal.

Rather than demonstrating a progressive benefit at lower pressures, many trials revealed a J-shaped curve in which the risk of cardiac events declines as the diastolic pressure falls from above 100 mmHg to approximately 85 mmHg, but then rises back up at pressures below 80 to 85 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55532%7ENEPH%2F81362\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55532 graphicRef81362 \">figure 5A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75482\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75482 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71321\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71321 \">figure 7</a>).
