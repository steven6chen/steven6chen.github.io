This referral should occur within days to no longer than a week. These include CHD with left-to-right shunting, such as ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, aortopulmonary window, and moderate cases of tetralogy of Fallot, and less commonly, dilated cardiomyopathy, which may be due to tachycardia or ALCAPA.

As an example, an infant with a large ventricular septal defect with associated pulmonary overcirculation due to a large amount of left-to-right flow across the defect may present with a history of poor feeding, failure to thrive, respiratory symptoms, grunting, and physical examination findings that include a loud, harsh holosystolic murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104797\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104797 \">movie 1</a>), tachypnea, and hepatomegaly. In contrast, patients with less severe cardiac disease may present with a single isolated finding. For example, a child with mild aortic stenosis may present with a pathologic murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104800\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104800 \">movie 2</a>) without any associated symptoms.</p><p>The following sections describe clinical features that are suggestive of underlying cardiac disease in a hemodynamically stable child. It is beyond the scope of this discussion to address every specific cardiac defect and the range of its clinical presentation. However, if an infant or child presents with one of these historical features or physical findings, the clinician needs to consider whether or not the underlying cause of these manifestations is likely due to cardiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105035 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>If the primary care provider has any question regarding whether referral is appropriate or the timing of referral, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should discuss the patient with a pediatric cardiologist by phone.

Patients with cardiogenic shock require emergent care. Urgent referral may also be warranted for those with cyanosis, syncope, or tachycardia depending upon the clinical context. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Urgent referral'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough history and physical examination should be performed in hemodynamically stable patients to identify those at risk for cardiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105035 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of stable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of referral is based upon the risk (and time course) that the underlying suspected cardiac disease may progress and potentially result in hemodynamic compromise, morbidity, and even mortality. If the primary care provider has any question regarding whether referral is appropriate or the timing of referral, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should discuss the patient with a pediatric cardiologist by phone. If there is any question, the patient should be referred. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Timing of referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most infants and children with serious cardiac disease, clinical manifestations present as a constellation of findings rather than one isolated finding. (See <a href=\"#H2412339\" class=\"local\">'Clinical context'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with cardiac disease often present with nonspecific symptoms, including lethargy, irritability, sweating, grunting, poor feeding, failure to thrive, and respiratory symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms in infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with cardiac disease may present with nonspecific symptoms, including lethargy, inability to keep up with their peers, respiratory distress, and diaphoresis with exertion. Although chest pain is one of the more frequent reasons for referral to a pediatric cardiologist, it is infrequently associated with cardiac disease. Fever may be seen in patients with cardiac disease due to systemic illness. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms in children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of cardiac disease increases if a sibling or parent has a history of congenital cardiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103088 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2413222\" class=\"local\">'Family history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key physical examination findings that are suggestive of underlying childhood cardiac disease include failure to thrive, poor peripheral perfusion, respiratory abnormalities (tachypnea, retractions, wheezes), and cardiac abnormalities (pathologic heart murmur, abnormal second heart sound, gallop, rub, active precordium). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination findings'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H14181578\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography may be helpful in identifying cardiac disease. The role of routine electrocardiography (ECG) as screening tools is less certain. ECG may be helpful in the diagnosis of specific cardiac diseases in an infant or child in whom cardiac disease is suspected based upon the history and physical examination. The routine use of pulse oximetry to screen for neonatal critical cardiac disease has been shown to be an effective screening test. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suspected-heart-disease-in-infants-and-children-criteria-for-referral/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ilina MV, Kepron CA, Taylor GP, et al.
