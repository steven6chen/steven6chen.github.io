These differences are probably because of variable effects on gene expression in different cell types. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of action of selective estrogen receptor modulators and down-regulators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> have antiestrogenic activity in breast tissue, reducing epithelial cell proliferation. This property has led to their clinical study as breast cancer chemopreventive agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-aromatase-inhibitors-for-breast-cancer-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, an important difference between the two drugs is their effect on the uterus, where <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> has an estrogen-like effect while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> acts as an estrogen antagonist. In apparent contrast to raloxifene, tamoxifen has been associated with endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], fibroids, polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], and endometrial tumors (estrogen agonist effects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Tamoxifen is also associated with other side effects, including hot flashes (an estrogen antagonist effect), vaginal discharge, menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and blood clots. Although longer treatment with tamoxifen increases the risk of adverse effects, the reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with longer treatment outweighs those risks. &#160;</p><p>This topic review will cover management of the major side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. The use of tamoxifen as a hormonal treatment for breast cancer, both in the adjuvant setting and for advanced disease, and the use of tamoxifen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> as chemopreventive agents in women at increased risk for breast cancer are discussed elsewhere.

Up to 80 percent of women prescribed tamoxifen complain of hot flashes, and about 30 percent rate them as severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, strong CYP2D6 inhibitors have the potential to adversely affect drug efficacy. A list of CYP2D6 inhibitors is available online. Among SSRIs, there is a gradient of potency for inhibition of CYP2D6; for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>&nbsp;are strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>&nbsp;are moderate inhibitors. However, the data to suggest that this issue decreases <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> effect are very weak, at best. Therefore, the choice of which SSRI or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) is up to the individual clinician and <span class=\"nowrap\">her/his</span> comfort with a specific agent.

The relative risks of venous thromboembolism are increased two-to three-fold in older women receiving tamoxifen. Additionally, the elevated risk of thromboembolic events associated with tamoxifen appears to continue as long as the patient takes the drug. More women experience pulmonary embolism when the treatment course of tamoxifen is extended to 10 years from 5 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.13-3.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for tamoxifen-induced VTE include prior surgery, fracture, and immobilization. These data suggest that women receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> should discontinue use for several days prior to prolonged immobilization from anticipated surgery or travel. In addition, there is evidence that patients receiving tamoxifen who harbor a heterozygous Factor V Leiden mutation have a nearly fivefold risk of thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The possibility that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> may be associated with an increased incidence of arterial thromboembolism (ie, stroke) was raised in two NSABP randomized trials: P-1 (the breast cancer prevention trial) and NSABP B-24, a trial of tamoxifen for intraductal breast cancer. However, the available data are conflicting, and any increased risk of stroke may be counterbalanced by favorable effects on ischemic heart disease. This was shown in the most recent overview analysis of randomized trials of adjuvant tamoxifen from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The non-significant excess of stroke deaths (three extra per 1000 women during the first 15 years) in women treated with tamoxifen was exactly balanced by a non-significant reduction in cardiac deaths (three fewer per 1000 women during the first 15 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
