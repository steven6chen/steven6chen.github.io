Unfortunately, the data on the effects of antineoplastic drugs administered during pregnancy have largely been derived from case reports, small case series, and collected reviews of pregnant women treated for a variety of cancers. There are even less data on long-term outcomes in offspring.</p><p>This topic will address the administration of chemotherapy for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in pregnancy. In order to optimize treatment outcomes, a pregnant woman with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer should be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in the fields of maternal-fetal medicine, gynecologic oncology, pediatrics, and pathology. </p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ovarian cancer in pregnancy and surgical management of this disease are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adnexal mass in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns about the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy during pregnancy arise because chemotherapy preferentially kills rapidly proliferating cells, and the fetus represents a rapidly proliferating cell mass. All chemotherapy agents used in the treatment of epithelial and nonepithelial ovarian cancers are pregnancy category D, meaning that fetal exposure to individual chemotherapeutic agents have resulted in adverse effects including intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity, and low birth weight in the infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Chemotherapy may also cause fetal toxicities similar to those observed in the mother (eg, bone marrow suppression).</p><p>The risks of spontaneous abortion, fetal death, and major malformations vary depending on the agent used and the trimester of pregnancy. These risks must be weighed against the benefits of immediate versus delayed (ie, postdelivery) chemotherapy for the mother. Ethical considerations of treatment during pregnancy have emphasized the role of patient autonomy and the concept of beneficence and nonmaleficence for both the mother and fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Although previous data suggested that the administration of chemotherapy increased the risk of fetal malformations, most data suggest this is not the case. It is now believed that the impact of chemotherapy during pregnancy is predominantly dependent on when treatment is administered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first four weeks of gestation (first two weeks post conception) the embryo is undifferentiated. Fetal exposure to cytotoxic agents at this point results in &quot;all or none&quot; phenomena: either the pregnancy is lost or it continues with no apparent adverse effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organogenesis occurs during weeks 5 to 10 weeks of gestation. The administration of cytotoxic drugs, particularly antimetabolites (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) and alkylating agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>), during this period carries an increased risk of fetal malformations. In a review of the literature, rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) for anti-neoplastic agents in single and combination therapy were 33, 27, and 25 percent for the first, second, and third trimesters. Rates of congenital malformations (included in the APOs) were 16, 8, and 6 percent for the first, second, and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The majority of stillborn infants and infants with chromosomal or congenital abnormalities occur when chemotherapy is administered in the first trimester. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When chemotherapy is delivered to the mother during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the risk of fetal malformation is lower. First trimester exposure poses a larger and more permanent risk to the fetus. Administration of chemotherapy within three weeks of anticipated delivery or beyond 35 weeks of gestation may induce neonatal myelosuppression and complicate delivery due to adverse effects of treatment on bone marrow reserves. This includes potential complications such as bleeding, sepsis, and death. Additionally, neonatal toxicity may be higher if chemotherapy is administered peripartum because placental drug clearance is generally more effective than either hepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal drug clearance in the neonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN CANCER DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several different histologic types of malignancy that can arise within the ovary including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), ovarian germ cell tumors, and sex-cord stromal tumors. In some series of women presenting with an ovarian malignancy while pregnant, germ cell tumors predominate, while others report a higher frequency of EOC. The indications and medical treatment of ovarian cancer during pregnancy by histologic type is discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adnexal mass in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Malignant neoplasms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84410292\"><span class=\"h1\">EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgery, the indications for adjuvant treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are similar for pregnant and nonpregnant women. However, administration of chemotherapy during the first trimester <strong>should be avoided</strong>. We recommend chemotherapy for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with early-stage EOC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 1</a>) if any of the following high-risk features is present: stage <span class=\"nowrap\">IA/IB,</span> grade <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3;</span> stage IC or II (any histology); serous or clear cell carcinoma (stage IA, IB, IC, or II) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with stage III or IV EOC </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294838285\"><span class=\"h2\">Regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with nonpregnant women, we recommend the use of a platinum drug plus taxane for women with EOC in pregnancy because, in general, this combination results in the best survival outcomes. For women diagnosed during pregnancy, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> because it is a better tolerated agent and reduces the risk of long-term side effects (eg, renal and neurotoxicity). Although there are few data to guide the use of taxanes in pregnancy, it has been used to treat breast cancer in pregnancy without apparent adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> because it is generally less myelotoxic. In the absence of data on the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, we recommend not using it in pregnancy.</p><p>All women with EOC in pregnancy should be informed of the limited data on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with treatment. In one of the largest cohort studies of pregnant women with all types of cancer treated at multiple institutions, 84 were exposed to taxanes and 74 were exposed to platinum-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Both drugs were associated with an increased risk of delivery of a small for gestational age infant: platinum odds ratio (OR) 3.12, 95% CI 1.45-6.70 and taxanes OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.11-3.86. However, it was not possible to determine whether these findings were related to in-utero drug exposure or to other factors, such as effects of other medications, maternal stress, lack of adequate gestational weight gain, and other prenatal factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294839653\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can be treated with single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> or a combination of carboplatin and a taxane. A decision should be made on an individual basis taking into account potential risks and benefits of treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294839610\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraperitoneal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of a larger experience, we do not administer intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy in these patients. There is only one case report of a woman with ovarian cancer treated with IP therapy for four cycles during pregnancy. She underwent a cesarean section at 37 weeks; the baby was male and had bilateral congenital talipes equinovarus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The role of IP therapy for advanced ovarian cancer is discussed separately.

The approach is similar to the treatment of nonpregnant women with early-stage EOC. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy of early stage (stage I and II) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancer&quot;, section on 'Choice of adjuvant treatment'</a>.)</p><p>For women who prefer not to receive treatment during pregnancy due to concerns for fetal safety, it may be reasonable to delay adjuvant chemotherapy until after delivery. The evidence to support this comes from two studies that evaluated the impact of a treatment start delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In these trials, 271 nonpregnant women with high-risk stage I EOC were randomly assigned treatment with adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> versus observation (trial 1) or P-32 (trial 2). In both trials, women who were not treated with cisplatin received cisplatin at the time of relapse. The main results were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> reduced the risk of relapse in both trials (compared with observation, hazard ratio [HR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.89; compared with P-32, HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.77).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference in five year overall survival (88 and 82 percent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> or observation; HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.44-2.98; 81 and 79 percent with cisplatin or P-32; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.72, 95% CI 0.37-1.43).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294838374\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced-stage disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with advanced disease should begin chemotherapy as soon as they are out of the first trimester and have recovered from surgery. We generally prefer to initiate treatment in two to four weeks after surgery for ovarian cancer. The approach to treatment is similar to that for nonpregnant women with advanced EOC. Although dose-dense (weekly) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> has been reported to improve progression-free survival, other groups have been unable to duplicate these data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Maximal surgical cytoreduction is usually undertaken initially.

When indicated, chemotherapy should be delayed at least until completion of the first trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The most commonly used regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65516 \">table 2</a>)).

Etoposide is teratogenic in mice and rats at doses much lower than the human dose and should not be used in the first trimester. A consensus report suggested paclitaxel-carboplatin or cisplatin-vinblastine-bleomycin as alternatives to BEP in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that germ cell neoplasms are exquisitely sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, several investigators have published case reports addressing a treatment delay until after the completion of the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. A summary of findings is presented below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One case report documents a woman with a yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor that was surgically resected at 19 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The pregnancy was allowed to continue and BEP was not initiated until after the baby was delivered at 36 weeks. At a follow-up of 27 months, there was no evidence of recurrence disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report described a patient with a yolk sac tumor resected at 22 weeks of gestation, after which the pregnancy was allowed to continue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Unfortunately, at 34 weeks she was found to have tumor regrowth. After secondary debulking and delivery of the infant, the mother was successfully treated with BEP and was without evidence of disease 39 months after her last treatment with chemotherapy.</p><p/><p>These reports suggest that delaying adjuvant chemotherapy may increase the risk of recurrence, although without an apparent risk to long-term recurrence free survival. Given the low quality of the data, however, a decision on the timing of adjuvant chemotherapy for women with a germ cell tumor should take into account the individual circumstances and preferences of the mother.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TUMORS OF LOW MALIGNANT POTENTIAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumors of low malignant potential have an excellent prognosis and management is the same as that for nonpregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
