The effector mechanisms include activation of the following systems: signal transduction machinery in the B cell cytoplasm (in the case of surface immunoglobulin receptors), receptors for the constant region of immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the complement system. They also play a role in the afferent limb of the immune system both through antigen presentation and by interacting with regulatory receptors on immune cells.</p><p>The basic aspects of immunoglobulin structure will be reviewed here. A discussion of their function, the derivation of monoclonal antibodies, and the various laboratory and clinical applications of immunoglobulin reagents is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN PROTEINS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Four-chain unit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunoglobulin molecule contains four separate polypeptides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two identical light (L) chains of molecular weight (MW) 23 kilodaltons (kd)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two identical heavy (H) chains of MW around 55 kd</p><p/><p>Each subunit folds into immunoglobulin domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. L chains have two domains. H chains have four or five. The domain structures and the complete four-chain unit, (H<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>), are maintained by covalent and noncovalent interactions within and between H and L chains.</p><p>The variable region of the L chain (VL) is the N (amino)-terminal half of the protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>) and is encoded by a V kappa or V lambda gene. The L chain joining region (JL) is a small region at the C (carboxy)-terminal end encoded by a separate J kappa or J lambda gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68398\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68398 \">figure 2</a>). The L chain constant region (CL) is the C-terminal half of the chain and is encoded by a C kappa or C lambda gene.</p><p>Similarly, the H chain variable region (VH) is at the amino-terminal end of the molecule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>). At the C-terminus of VH is the D (diversity) region, followed by the H chain joining region (JH) region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68398\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68398 \">figure 2</a>). The H chain constant region (CH) is much larger. The VH, VL, and CL regions all consist of only one domain, while CH contains three or four domains. The domains of the CH region are numbered with CH1 nearest VH and CH3 or CH4 at the C-terminus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>). When any immunoglobulin is produced as an integral membrane protein by B cells, there is a hydrophobic transmembrane sequence that comes after the last CH region and anchors the immunoglobulin into the cell membrane. This sequence is not present on secreted immunoglobulins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Combining site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The variable regions of each pair of H and L chains form an antibody combining site, the portion of the antibody that interacts with antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, a single four-chain immunoglobulin molecule contains two combining sites and is said to be bivalent. Within each H or L chain V region amino acid sequence, greater variety of amino acids occurs in certain positions. These highly variable sections are called the hypervariable regions. Between them are the less variable framework regions. The hypervariable regions are juxtaposed in the tertiary protein structure to form the combining site that makes contact with antigen. They are therefore referred to as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68398\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68398 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hinge region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hinge region is between CH1 and CH2 of certain antibody classes (immunoglobulin G [IgG], immunoglobulin A [IgA], and immunoglobulin D [IgD]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>). This area is more flexible than a standard CH domain. The hinge region permits a single immunoglobulin molecule to be able to bind to two sites on one antigen particle or molecule. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) possess hinge-like regions at the C-terminal end of CH2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbohydrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody molecules contain several glycosylation sites distributed in their sequences. These occur mainly on the H chain. Saccharides increase immunoglobulin solubility and protect it from enzymatic degradation. Sugars also contribute to several of the biologic properties of immunoglobulin by influencing interactions with immunoglobulin receptors, binding factors, and other serum proteins, such as the complement system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The sialic acid content of H chain oligosaccharides has been implicated in important anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IgG. Immunoglobulin molecules with high sialic acid content have lower affinity for Fc receptors generally, but are thought to interact with a still hypothetical class of &quot;regulatory macrophages&quot; to suppress inflammation and inflammatory immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Structural features of these saccharides have also been implicated in certain disease processes, such as rheumatoid arthritis, where antibody reactions with other antibodies may be an important pathogenetic mechanism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOGLOBULIN CLASSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody heavy (H) and light (L) chain classes and subclasses are distinguished by major structural differences (eg, four versus five H chain domains, the covalent association of four-chain units to form dimers or pentamers) and by their primary amino acid sequence. Mammals possess two classes of light chains, kappa and lambda. The proportion of antibodies containing kappa versus lambda light chains varies among species. The ratio is approximately 3:2 in humans.</p><p>Five major classes of H chains are found in mammals, designed mu, delta, gamma, alpha, and epsilon. These five types of H chain correspond to the five major classes of immunoglobulins, respectively: immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin D (IgD), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE).</p><p>In humans, IgG is further divided into four subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgA is subdivided into IgA1 and IgA2. Any heavy chain class or subclass can combine with either light chain class to build the four-chain unit.</p><p>IgG, IgA, and IgD have three constant region domains. IgM and IgE have four (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>). Various properties of the different antibody classes and subclasses are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74659\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74659 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Note that the variable region, which interacts with antigen, is encoded by gene segments that are distinct from those that encode the constant regions. The constant regions determine the various classes of immunoglobulin (eg, IgM, IgA, or IgG) through the process of class-switch recombination. Because the variable region genes are distinct, antibodies of different classes could have the same variable region. Class-switch recombination occurs during antigen-dependent B cell activation and development and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;, section on 'Immunoglobulin class-switching'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">IgG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most abundant immunoglobulin and constitutes 75 percent of serum immunoglobulin in an adult human. The concentration is between 500 and 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. IgG is monomeric (H<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>) and has a molecular weight (MW) of 150 kilodaltons (kd). IgG is also found throughout internal tissues because of its abundance and relatively small size. The mean half-life of IgG in the blood is 23 days, although this property varies with subclass.</p><p>IgG subclasses are present in the serum at varying concentrations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG1 at 300 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG2 at 100 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG3 at 30 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.3 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4 at 20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.2 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span></p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclasses-physical-properties-genetics-and-biologic-functions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">IgM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin M (IgM) occurs as a monomer when located in the B cell membrane and as a pentamer (H<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>)5 with a MW of 950 kd when secreted. Hexameric forms of IgM have also been observed, but their biologic significance is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pentameric IgM is covalently linked by disulfide bonds with a separate molecule called the J chain (which should not be confused with the J regions of immunoglobulin H and L chains). The serum concentration of IgM is about 50 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.5 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. Its half-life in the circulation is five days. Because of its size, the majority of IgM is found in the circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">IgA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration in serum is about 50 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.5 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> but it is the predominant antibody class in secretions. IgA occurs mainly as monomers (MW 160 kd) and as dimers (H<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>)2 held together by the same J chain found in pentameric IgM. IgA has a serum half-life of about six days.</p><p>IgA has a shorter half-life than IgG, and tremendous quantities are secreted into various body spaces and onto mucosal surfaces (the gut lumen, the pharynx and sinuses, the larger airways, although not the alveoli). As a result, IgA is the isotype with the highest rate of production, although its serum concentration is less than IgG. In a 70 kg adult, approximately 4.5 g of IgA is produced each day, compared with 2.4 g of IgG and 0.6 g of IgM (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-iga-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective IgA deficiency: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Normal biology of IgA'</a>). IgA in the circulation is primarily monomeric.</p><p>The IgA in secretions, called secretory IgA (SIgA, MW 400 kd) is mostly dimeric. It contains an additional protein, the secretory component (SC, also called the secretory piece), which is synthesized by epithelial cells. SC is a fragment of the epithelial cell poly-immunoglobulin receptor (poly-IgR or PIgR), which binds the J chain in polymeric IgA and IgM.</p><p>IgA, produced by B cells within the mucosa, is taken up as a complex with poly-IgR at the basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells. Poly-IgR undergoes proteolysis at the apical surface where SIgA is secreted. Some pentameric IgM is also secreted in this fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">IgD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is present at low levels in serum, &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. However, along with IgM, IgD is predominant among the surface receptors of mature B cells, where it plays a key role in B cells activation. IgD has MW 170 kd and a serum half-life of three days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">IgE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin E (IgE) has the lowest concentration in normal human serum. The concentration is usually expressed as international units. One unit is equivalent to 2.4 ng. Approximately 100 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> or 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> is the upper limit of normal. In disease states such as atopic dermatitis, the IgE concentration can rise proportionally very high (eg, 100-fold or more). IgE has a MW of 190 kd, as it is heavily glycosylated and has 5 CH domains. While it has a short serum half-life of about three days, it plays a prominent role in immune responses to helminth parasites and in allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8608107\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBODY FRAGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a number of clinical and experimental applications, antibodies are chemically modified to generate reagents with particular properties. The example given here involves chemical modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG), although antibodies of other classes can be similarly altered. These fragments generally have greatly shortened half-lives compared with the native molecule, which negatively impacts their therapeutic potential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8012461\"><span class=\"h2\">Papain digestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protease papain cleaves the IgG hinge region, yielding three antibody fragments, two of which are identical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8012447\"><span class=\"h3\">Fab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two identical fragments are generated, each bearing one combining site. These fragments are called Fab (antigen binding), since they react with antigen. A Fab fragment contains a complete light (L) chain and the H chain variable region (VH) and H chain constant region (CH1) domains of the heavy (H) chain. Clinical applications of Fab fragments are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8012454\"><span class=\"h3\">Fc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The other papain cleavage product is called Fc, an abbreviation for the fragment that is &quot;crystallizable.&quot; The Fc portion contains the binding site for C1q of the classical complement pathway, although Fc alone cannot bind or activate complement because it is monovalent. The Fc portion of IgG is comprised of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Several distinct receptor systems on leukocytes interact with the Fc of various immunoglobulin isotypes (collectively referred to as Fc receptors) and influence a variety of cellular processes influencing both innate and adaptive immune functions. The function and clinical application of the Fc portion of antibody molecules are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8012482\"><span class=\"h2\">Pepsin digestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pepsin cleaves IgG near the site at which papain acts, but leaves the hinge regions joined, yielding a fragment containing both combining sites. This fragment is called F(ab')<sub>2</sub> (&quot;f-a-b-prime-two&quot;). Since F(ab')<sub>2</sub> is bivalent (has two combining sites), it may bind two particles simultaneously and agglutinate and precipitate antigens. In contrast, Fab has only one combining site and cannot participate in these reactions. The clinical applications of agglutination and precipitation are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIGENIC DIFFERENCES AMONG ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an antibody is introduced into a foreign host under appropriate conditions, it can elicit a specific immune response, as can any other glycoprotein antigen. This process of generating antibodies to antibodies reveals various types of differences among them. Immunoglobulin molecules have different antigenic determinants, which are defined by their variation among species (isotype), among individuals within a species (allotype), or within an individual (idiotype) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70298 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Isotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;isotype&quot; is often used interchangeably with the terms &quot;class&quot; and &quot;subclass.&quot; Isotypic determinants are immunoglobulin structures characteristic of a particular class or subclass of antibody heavy (H) or light (L) chains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70298 \">figure 3</a>). Isotypes are defined in relation to H and L chain C (constant) regions only. All isotypes are found among the immunoglobulins of all healthy individuals of a species. Thus, antibodies specific for isotypes are generally observed with immunization of a different species (heterogeneic or xenogeneic immunization), such as human antibodies to horse immunoglobulin or to mouse monoclonal antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Allotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the genes encoding antibody C regions are polymorphic and thus may differ between individuals. The antigenic determinants distinguishing an antibody of a particular isotype encoded by allele &quot;a&quot; from an antibody of the same isotype encoded by allele &quot;b&quot; are called allotypic determinants (allotypes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70298 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Allotypes have been defined serologically by examining reactivity patterns of anti-allotypic antisera. They occur in all subclasses of IgG, IgA2, and kappa light chains. Human allotypes are named with a letter and number designating the antibody class and subclass, followed by the letter &quot;m&quot; and a number in parentheses, such as G1m(1), A2m(1), and Km(1).</p><p>Protein sequence data correlate allotypes with particular amino acid residues in certain locations in the H or L chain. Allotype-specific antibodies may be obtained by immunizing an individual of the same species who does not express the allotype (allogeneic immunization). Fortunately, anti-allotypic antibodies are generally not an issue in the therapeutic administration of human immunoglobulin.</p><p>Allotypes may correlate with variations in function or immune responsiveness, such as response to polysaccharide vaccines and atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-of-immunoglobulins/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Mechanisms have not yet been described, but are likely to involve both structural correlates as well as linked elements in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene complex on chromosome 14.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An idiotype is an antigenic determinant that is located in the variable region of an immunoglobulin molecule. The variety of idiotypic determinants, or idiotypes, occurring in one individual is vastly greater than the number of isotypes or allotypes. This is because there are many more V region genes (including D and J) than there are C region genes, which determine the immunoglobulin isotypes and allotypes. In addition, immunoglobulin V genes undergo tremendous diversification during B cell development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Idiotypes may be unique to one antibody, may be shared by antibodies with the same or different antigen specificities, may be found in the same or different individuals of a species, and may even be observed on antibodies from different species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70298 \">figure 3</a>). It is also possible to obtain antibodies specific for an idiotype (anti-Id antibodies) in the same individual that produced the Id-bearing antibody. Anti-Id antibodies are observed in many natural antibody responses to infection or antigen administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8608264\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An immunoglobulin molecule contains four chains: two light (L) chains and two heavy (H) chains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 1</a>).
