Although it is sometimes stated that chronic pancreatitis &quot;burns out&quot; over time, the duration of time over which this may occur is highly variable, if it occurs at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In addition, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine dysfunction may develop as the disease progresses, and a variety of complications can occur, including pseudocysts, bile duct or duodenal obstruction, pancreatic ascites, splenic vein thrombosis, and pseudoaneurysms.</p><p>The etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of this disorder in adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96851787\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive fibroinflammatory process of the pancreas that results in permanent structural damage, which leads to impairment of exocrine and endocrine function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Chronic pancreatitis may be divided based on underlying morphology into the following: a large-duct type and a small-duct type with or without calcification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96851837\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACUTE AND CHRONIC PANCREATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory response to pancreatic injury and is usually nonprogressive. Recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis may lead to chronic pancreatitis over time. Chronic and acute pancreatitis can be distinguished by several features.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pancreatitis may be asymptomatic over long periods of time, can present with a fibrotic mass, or there may be symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency without pain. Acute pancreatitis is almost always painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum amylase and lipase concentrations tend to be normal in patients with chronic pancreatitis, but are almost always elevated with acute disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morphologically, chronic pancreatitis is a patchy focal disease characterized by a mononuclear infiltrate and fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80018 \">picture 1</a>). In contrast, acute pancreatitis diffusely involves a large portion of the entire pancreas with a predominantly neutrophilic inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two disorders may involve a different pathophysiologic process.

There is considerable variation in individual sensitivity to the toxicity of alcohol; thus, it is difficult to define a &quot;safe&quot; level of consumption. This is illustrated by the fact that only 5 to 10 percent of alcoholics develop chronic pancreatitis, suggesting that other factors may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Very high protein or fat diets, for example, have been implicated, although this hypothesis was refuted in at least one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another hypothesis is that patients at risk for pancreatitis have a genetic predisposition that increases susceptibility to injury from toxins, such as alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Cigarette smoking also appears to increase the risk of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Alcohol abuse was previously reported to account for 70 to 80 percent of cases of chronic pancreatitis, but the association between alcohol and chronic pancreatitis is complex and these high percentages likely overestimate the contribution of alcohol. </p><p>In a large cohort study from the United States, alcohol was estimated to account for 45 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The study also found that while alcohol was the most common etiology in men (59 percent), it was the least common etiology in women (28 percent). In women, both nonalcoholic and idiopathic etiologies were more common (37 and 35 percent, respectively). However, a couple of the study&rsquo;s limitations should be pointed out:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The designation of alcohol as the cause of chronic pancreatitis was based upon the report of the patient&rsquo;s physician and did not include information on the quantity or duration of alcohol consumption. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the physician indicated multiple contributing factors (eg, alcohol and genetic factors), alcohol was considered to be the primary cause.</p><p/><p>These limitations could lead to cases being incorrectly attributed to alcohol abuse. This is particularly important to keep in mind since patients deemed to have alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis are often stigmatized both by society and by physicians. In addition, the assumption that a large proportion of cases of chronic pancreatitis are due to alcohol can lead to patients being labeled &ldquo;closet alcoholics&rdquo; when no alternative etiology can be found. More studies with strict diagnostic criteria are needed to clarify the true prevalence of alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cigarette smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between cigarette smoking and both acute and chronic pancreatitis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In a multicenter study of 1000 patients with chronic and recurrent acute pancreatitis in the United States, cigarette smoking was found to be an independent, dose-dependent risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Smoking'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary pancreatitis accounts for a small subset of cases of chronic pancreatitis. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with a penetrance rate of 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The majority of affected individuals develop symptoms before the age of 20, and often before the age of five. Hereditary pancreatitis is associated with a marked increased risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The treatment of hereditary pancreatitis is similar to that of other causes of chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and contributing risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and nonfamilial risk factors for exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ductal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstruction of the pancreatic duct from strictures secondary to trauma, pseudocysts, calcific stones, or tumors can lead to chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The histologic abnormalities that are induced may persist after relief of the obstruction.</p><p>Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction has also been associated with chronic pancreatitis in a small subset of patients; whether this is a causative factor remains unknown. In one report of 100 patients, those with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction were four times more likely to have evidence of chronic pancreatitis than patients without sphincter dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>It is controversial whether pancreas divisum also may cause chronic pancreatitis by producing a relative obstruction to flow at the minor papilla. Pancreas divisum is a common anatomic variant which occurs in approximately 7 percent of individuals in autopsy series; it is due to failure of the embryologically derived dorsal and ventral pancreas to fuse, resulting in separate pancreatic ductal systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas divisum: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite the prevalence of pancreas divisum, most affected subjects are asymptomatic, leading to considerable debate regarding the importance of this entity as a risk factor for pancreatitis. The arguments against an association cite studies which have found that the incidence of pancreas divisum is the same in patients with and without pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. On the other hand, different reports have found that 60 percent of patients with pancreas divisum had relief of abdominal pain after surgical sphincteroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, most of the patients who achieved benefit with minor papillotomy in the latter review were suffering from recurrent bouts of acute rather than chronic pancreatitis.</p><p>Thus, caution should be exercised in the management of patients with pancreas divisum. Those with pain and no evidence of pancreatitis should not be treated; they are likely to have another etiology of their pain (eg, irritable bowel syndrome). It is possible that minor papillotomy will be of benefit in patients with pain and chronic pancreatitis, but endoscopic stenting should not be performed; this procedure can cause permanent damage to the pancreatic ducts, possibly resulting in chronic pancreatitis and chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

Children are commonly affected, and often die in early adulthood from endocrine and exocrine dysfunction. The cassava fruit had been implicated as an etiologic factor in this disorder, although it is no longer thought to be related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Mutations in the serine protease inhibitor SPINK1 have been identified in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic diseases implicated as causes of chronic pancreatitis include cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and perhaps primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and hypertriglyceridemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of cases of chronic pancreatitis that are not related to alcohol abuse are idiopathic. Concealed alcohol ingestion, hypersensitivity to small amounts of alcohol, unreported pancreatic trauma, and mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene, which are responsible for hereditary pancreatitis, and the cystic fibrosis gene may be contributing factors in patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-pancreatitis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutations of the cystic fibrosis gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystic fibrosis is due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>). Most patients with cystic fibrosis develop progressive pancreatic damage as a result of defective ductular and acinar pancreatic secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mutations in CFTR have been identified in some adults with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis who have no other evidence of cystic fibrosis; these mutations also may contribute to the development of chronic pancreatitis in patients who have additional risk factors for chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. As an example, in a study of 27 patients with apparently idiopathic pancreatitis, 37 percent had at least one abnormal CFTR allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a similar series of 134 consecutive patients with chronic pancreatitis attributed to a variety of causes, 13 percent had a CFTR mutation on one chromosome (compared to a frequency of 5 percent among 600 local unrelated partners of persons with a family history of cystic fibrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The CFTR mutations identified in the above reports may underestimate their frequency in the setting of pancreatitis since only limited genetic screening was performed. Most commercially available genetic screening tests only identify 18 to 23 of the most severe CFTR mutations that cause classic, childhood cystic fibrosis. It is possible that a number of &quot;milder&quot; mutations within the CFTR locus may be associated with chronic pancreatitis. This hypothesis was supported in a study where 18 out of 40 patients (45 percent) with chronic pancreatitis had at least one abnormal allele when complete DNA analysis was performed looking for the more than 1000 known mutations in CFTR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Another study suggested that CFTR-related pancreatitis risk correlated with having two CFTR mutations and reduced extrapancreatic CFTR function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In one study, nine variants of CFTR (R74Q, R75Q, R117H, R170H, L967S, L997F, D1152H, S1235R and D1270N) not associated with typical cystic fibrosis were found to be associated with pancreatitis through defective bicarbonate permeability and conductance with normal chloride function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These findings suggest that CFTR mutations may have an important role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3545537205\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatitis susceptibility genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the PRSS1 and CFTR mutations discussed above, mutations or polymorphisms in several other genes have been associated with chronic pancreatitis. Loss of function variants in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1) gene may play a role by altering the first line of defense to prematurely activated trypsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. SPINK1 can only inhibit 20 percent of the activity of pancreatic trypsin in its normal state and therefore alterations in SPINK1 are thought to be a cofactor for a polygenic complex trait or a disease modifier when combined with other genetic factors to predispose to pancreatitis. Chymotrypsinogen C produced in pancreatic acinar cells encodes for the digestive enzyme chymotrypsin C and can also act on the calcium-binding loop in the absence of calcium to destroy prematurely activated trypsin. Many polymorphisms identified in this gene have been found to be overrepresented in pancreatitis patients compared with controls and have been identified in Indian patients with tropical pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Other potential susceptibility loci in genes that do not regulate intrapancreatic trypsin activity are the claudin-2 (CLDN2) and the carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) genes. Mutations in CLDN2 cause atypical localization of CLDN2 in pancreatic acinar cells and have been reported to interact with alcohol consumption to increase risk of pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Variants in CPA1 may lead to an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis through endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by misfolding rather than increased trypsin activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis is incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, there are two consistent findings that are characteristic and may help explain the pathogenesis of this disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is hypersecretion of protein which is not compensated for by an increase in ductal bicarbonate secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This impairment in ductal bicarbonate secretion is the basis for the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> pancreatic function test used to diagnosis chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inflammatory changes seen on histologic specimens are patchy within the exocrine pancreas.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteinaceous ductal plugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One theory regarding the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis suggests that increased secretion of pancreatic proteins causes proteinaceous plugs to form within the interlobular and intralobular ducts. These plugs may act as a nidus for calcification, leading to stone formation within the duct system. The net result is the formation of ductal epithelial lesions that scar and obstruct the ducts, thereby causing inflammatory changes and cell loss. The formation of plugs within some but not all of the ducts explains the patchy nature of this disease.</p><p>A protein called GP2 has been identified as a major component of intraductal plugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. GP2 is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchored protein that is cleaved from the zymogen granule membrane and secreted into pancreatic juice. A similar protein, uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein), is secreted by the thick ascending limb of the kidney and constitutes the matrix for renal casts.</p><p>Another protein released from the pancreatic acinar cell, lithostathine, is thought to normally prevent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> precipitation and therefore stone formation in pancreatic juice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Although lithostathine levels are low in alcoholics with chronic calcific pancreatitis, this appears to be only one factor involved in stone formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemia has been proposed as another factor in the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis. In an experimental canine model, for example, chronic pancreatitis was produced by ligating and separating branches flowing into the left pancreatic lobe from the splenic artery, thereby inducing chronic ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Macroscopic findings at three and six months after model preparation showed that the pancreas was hard, with severe inflammatory change.</p><p>However, it is more likely that ischemia is important in exacerbating or perpetuating rather than initiating disease. Other canine and feline models of partial pancreatic duct ligation (which may be analogous to plug and stone formation in human chronic pancreatitis) have found that ductal hypertension increased the resistance to blood flow within the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Vascular perfusion decreased further following secretory stimuli. Pancreatic interstitial pressure may rise to a greater degree in patients with chronic pancreatitis than in normal individuals due to the inelasticity of the gland. This model explains why ductal decompression (eg, Puestow procedure) improves chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antioxidants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pancreatitis are frequently nutritionally depleted, particularly with regard to antioxidants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>, vitamins C and E, and methionine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. An imbalance between a decrease in antioxidants and an increased demand for them in &quot;stressed cells&quot; may lead to elevations in free radical formation, which is in turn associated with lipid peroxidation and cellular impairment. This hypothesis is supported by a report in which antioxidant therapy led to improved pain in a 10-year-old boy with calcific chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Controlled trials are needed to define the role of antioxidant therapy.</p><p>In a randomized trial, 127 patients were assigned to either placebo or an antioxidant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. After six months, the reduction in the number of painful days per month was higher in the patients who received antioxidants compared with those who received placebo (7.4 versus 3.2 days). In addition, patients who received antioxidants were more likely to become pain free (32 versus 13 percent).</p><p>Antioxidants may be more effective in patients with chronic pancreatitis due to causes other than alcohol. In a retrospective study of 516 patients with chronic pancreatitis, antioxidants were tried in 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The study found that antioxidants were more often effective in patients with idiopathic and obstructive chronic pancreatitis than in patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (25 versus 4 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pancreatitis has been found in association with other autoimmune diseases such as Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and renal tubular acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In one report, a serum autoantibody to a pancreatic antigen was found in 6 of 20 patients (30 percent) with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, 3 of 11 patients (27 percent) with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, and 1 of 15 patients (7 percent) with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. By comparison, this autoantibody was present in no patients with stone-related chronic pancreatitis or autoimmune thyroiditis, or in healthy controls.</p><p>Some cases of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis are associated with the expression of novel HLA-DR antigens on duct cells, in combination with a localized T cell inflammatory infiltrate. These observations lend further support to an autoimmune pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>A rare autoimmune disorder of the pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis) has also been described. Clinical characteristics include symptomatic or asymptomatic diffuse enlargement of the pancreas, diffuse and irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, increased circulating levels of gamma globulin, the presence of autoantibodies, and a possible association with other autoimmune diseases. Fibrosis with lymphocytic infiltration is seen on pathology. The disorder is associated with elevated immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 concentrations.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The first is a decrease in bicarbonate secretion, due to either functional impairment caused by genetic abnormalities of the ductal cells, or mechanical obstruction such as strictures or tumors. The second involves intraparenchymal activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreatic gland. This may be due to genetic abnormalities (such as those seen in hereditary pancreatitis) that directly cause impairment in enzyme activation and regulation or predispose to toxic injury from environmental exposures, such as alcohol.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ammann RW, Akovbiantz A, Largiader F, Schueler G.
