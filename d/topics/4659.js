It can cause diarrhea, nausea, and stomach ache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115033217\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryptosporidiosis does not always cause symptoms. It is caused by a parasite. Some people carry the parasite without knowing it.</p><p>When symptoms do happen, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>People with conditions that weaken the body's infection-fighting system can get sicker from cryptosporidiosis. This includes people with HIV and AIDS. The body's infection-fighting system is also called the &quot;immune system.&quot; People with weak immune systems have a hard time fighting infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115033231\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends. See your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe diarrhea (4 or more runny or watery bowel movements in 1 day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot eat or drink</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have symptoms that last for more than 2 weeks</p><p/><p>Young children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems should make sure to see their doctor or nurse if they have symptoms. That's because they can get dehydrated more easily than other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115033246\"><span class=\"h1\">How does cryptosporidiosis spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis lives in bowel movements from infected people and animals. It can spread through:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water &ndash; The parasite can live in drinking water systems or swimming pools. People can get infected when they swallow water that has the parasite in it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touching infected people &ndash; Someone who has the infection can spread it if he or she does not wash his or her hands after a bowel movement. Or a baby who is infected can have the parasite in his or her diaper from a bowel movement. You can get sick if you change the baby's diaper and do not wash your hands afterwards.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animals &ndash; A person can get the infection from touching an infected animal. Children are more likely to get infected this way. That's because children are more likely to touch animals and not wash their hands afterwards.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food &ndash; Food that has the parasite in it can make a person sick. But cooking the food can kill the parasite.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115033261\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for cryptosporidiosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have it, he or she will ask you for a sample of your bowel movement. The sample can be tested for cryptosporidiosis and other infections that can cause the same symptoms.</p><p>Doctors can also use samples of other body fluids or tissue to look for the parasite. But these samples are not always needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115033276\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cryptosporidiosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends. Most people with healthy immune systems get better in about 2 weeks without treatment. If the symptoms are severe or last longer than 2 weeks, doctors can give a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nitazoxanide</a> (brand name: Alinia). Although this medicine might not help everyone, it might help stop diarrhea in some people and help keep the infection from spreading.</p><p>For people without healthy immune systems, it is important to try and make them stronger. For example, people with HIV who are not taking HIV medicines need to start taking them right away. These medicines boost the immune system, and this is the best way to get rid of the infection. People without healthy immune systems might also get <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nitazoxanide</a>. However, the medicine does not always help.</p><p>People who have severe diarrhea might need treatment in the hospital. Doctors can give medicines to help stop diarrhea. They can also give fluids through an &quot;IV.&quot; This is a thin tube that goes into a vein. It can help put fluids back in the body if a person loses too much water from diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115033291\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cryptosporidiosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower your chances of getting cryptosporidiosis if you do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands after going to the bathroom or changing diapers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw away dirty diapers and animal bowel movements in a closed garbage can away from where you cook and eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> drink water from streams, lakes, or public swimming pools.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear disposable gloves when handling bowel movements from pets. Then wash your hands well when you are done, even if you were wearing gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Handle food safely &ndash; Here are some things you should do:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> drink unpasteurized milk or foods made with it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wash fruits and vegetables well before eating them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wash your hands, knives, and cutting boards after they touch raw food.</p><p/><p>If you get sick, you can keep from spreading cryptosporidiosis to other people by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staying home from work or school until you feel better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not</strong> swimming in a public pool until your diarrhea has been gone for 2 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115033306\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dehydration-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dehydration in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
