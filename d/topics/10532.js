These include hypertensive encephalopathy, retinal hemorrhages, papilledema, or acute and subacute kidney injury. A review of the manifestations and treatment of hypertensive emergencies is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Much more common, however, is the relatively asymptomatic or completely asymptomatic patient with a blood pressure in the &quot;severe&quot; range (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;180/&ge;120</span> mmHg), often a mild headache, but <strong>no </strong>signs or symptoms of acute end-organ damage. This entity of severe asymptomatic hypertension is sometimes called hypertensive urgency and, as with hypertensive emergencies, occurs more frequently among patients who have been nonadherent with either their chronic antihypertensive drug regimen or their low-sodium diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Severe hypertension can also develop in medication-adherent patients following ingestion of large quantities of salt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and can be controlled by resuming a low-salt diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypertensive emergencies in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, severely elevated blood pressure should be swiftly confirmed with repeated measurement utilizing proper technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65136 \">table 1</a>). The technique of measuring blood pressure is presented in detail elsewhere.

Data from the Studying the Treatment of Acute hyperTension (STAT) registry indicate that the outpatient management of patients with acute severe hypertension is poor and that many patients are lost to follow-up soon after evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, many of these patients will return to the emergency department for recurrent uncontrolled hypertension within three months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8275477\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several questions related to the management of patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>How quickly should the blood pressure be reduced?</strong> &minus; The blood pressure should be reduced over a period of hours to days, although slower reductions may be needed in older adult patients at high risk for cerebral or myocardial ischemia resulting from excessively rapid reduction of blood pressure. Determining how rapidly to lower the blood pressure is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H18508375\" class=\"local\">'Rapidity of blood pressure lowering'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the blood pressure target during this time period?</strong> &minus; The blood pressure should usually be lowered to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;160/&lt;100</span> mmHg. However, the mean arterial pressure should not be lowered by more than 25 to 30 percent over the first two to four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. Thus, the short-term blood pressure target, during the first several hours, may need to be above <span class=\"nowrap\">160/100</span> mmHg in patients who present with very high pressures. This approach has not been well studied and is based mostly upon experience. In the long-term, the blood pressure should usually be reduced further (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/&lt;90</span> mmHg or <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/&lt;80</span> mmHg). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure reduction goal'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>How should this goal be achieved?</strong> &minus; The strategy to lower blood pressure in such patients depends upon whether the blood pressure should be lowered more quickly (period of hours) or less quickly (period of days). In addition, moving patients to a quiet room to rest can lead to a fall in systolic pressure of 10 to 20 mmHg or more. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic strategies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the blood pressure needs to be lowered over a period of hours, some clinicians use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>, despite the variable efficacy and known adverse effects of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Short-acting drugs are most commonly used when the blood pressure must be below an arbitrary threshold before discharge. Otherwise, many clinicians prefer long-acting drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>) and a follow-up primary care office visit in the next one to two days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the blood pressure needs to be lowered over a period of days, our approach depends upon the circumstances. In general, the treatment is resumption of antihypertensive therapy (in nonadherent patients), initiation of antihypertensive therapy (if patients are treatment na&iuml;ve), or the addition of another antihypertensive drug (in patients who are currently treated).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18508375\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapidity of blood pressure lowering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapidity with which blood pressure should be brought to safe levels is controversial and <strong>not</strong> based upon high-quality medical evidence. In the absence of symptoms, a gradual reduction in pressure is suggested over a period of several hours to several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This suggestion stems from and seeks to balance two major concerns. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of adverse events (eg, stroke, acute kidney injury, or myocardial infarction) that may occur if the blood pressure is lowered too rapidly or to a level below the ability for autoregulation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential risk of imminent cardiovascular events that may result from severe hypertension if the blood pressure is not quickly and sufficiently reduced. In patients visiting an emergency department for severe hypertension, potential legal ramifications partially motivate lowering the blood pressure in a short period of time.</p><p/><p>There is no proven benefit from rapid reduction of blood pressure in patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/2,7,11,12,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,11,12,14,16</a>], and most such patients who present in the ambulatory setting can be managed as outpatients. The following findings are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective study of 59,535 patients who presented in the ambulatory setting with severe asymptomatic hypertension, there appeared to be no substantial benefit from emergency department referral compared with sending the patient home from the office for outpatient management of blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At six months, rates of major cardiovascular events were similar and low in both groups (0.9 percent), and patients sent home had lower 30-day hospital admission rates (48 versus 59 percent). Although blood pressure control rates were higher at one month in patients referred to the emergency department, there was no difference at six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another large retrospective study examined 1016 such patients who presented to an emergency department; 435 patients received acute treatment of the blood pressure, and 581 patients were not given acute treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There were no differences in return to the emergency department at 24 hours and at 30 days, and there were no differences in mortality at 30 days and at one year.</p><p/><p>On the contrary, rapid and aggressive antihypertensive therapy can induce cerebral or myocardial ischemia or infarction, or acute kidney injury, if the blood pressure falls below the range at which tissue perfusion can be maintained by autoregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/8,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,18</a>]. This has been most often described with sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, which often leads to an unpredictable and uncontrolled blood pressure reduction as well as severe ischemic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The individual patient's risk for an adverse event and the probable duration of severe hypertension must be considered when deciding how quickly to reduce the blood pressure. As an example, older adult patients may be at particularly high risk for cerebral or myocardial ischemia if the blood pressure is lowered excessively <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> too rapidly. In such patients, who often will have a high pulse pressure (eg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg with systolic blood pressure &ge;180 mmHg), the initial goal blood pressure may need to be achieved even more slowly (eg, over a week or more).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure reduction goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults with severe asymptomatic hypertension, the shorter-term goal of management is to reduce the blood pressure to <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;160/&le;100</span> mmHg. However, the mean arterial pressure should not be lowered by more than 25 to 30 percent over the first several hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be provided a quiet room in which to rest.

However, <strong>sublingual nifedipine is contraindicated</strong> in this setting and should <strong>not</strong> be used. As noted above, cerebral or myocardial ischemia or infarction can be induced by aggressive antihypertensive therapy if the blood pressure falls below the range at which tissue perfusion can be maintained by autoregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/8,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,18</a>]. This has been most often described with sublingual nifedipine, which may produce an unpredictable and uncontrolled blood pressure reduction as well as severe ischemic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This was a major reason why the use of nifedipine capsules for hypertension is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), and why most hospitals' intensive care units and emergency departments restrict the use of this medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>There are regional and national variations in the initial choice of oral drug therapy for patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension. In some places, local policy dictates that blood pressures must be treated and lowered below an arbitrary threshold before the patient can be discharged; in such cases, the two most common agents are (although others are sometimes used) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> (but not intended as long-term therapy) at a dose of 0.2 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> (if the patient is not volume overloaded) at a dose of 6.25 or 12.5 mg</p><p/><p>Following administration of one of these agents, the patient is observed for a few hours to ascertain a reduction in blood pressure of 20 to 30 mmHg. Thereafter, a longer-acting agent is prescribed, and the patient is sent home to follow-up within a few days. The drop in blood pressure may take relatively longer with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> and may be too large among patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. </p><p>An alternative approach is to forgo these shorter-acting agents and initiate a long-acting agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>) with follow-up in clinic after one or two days. This strategy may be superior to the strategy that includes the use of shorter-acting agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] and may eventually lead to reevaluation of policies mandating the use of shorter-acting antihypertensive agents.

A calcium channel blocker (but <strong>not</strong> sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>), beta blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can be started. Examples in these categories are oral nifedipine 30 mg once daily (of the long-acting preparation), oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> XL 50 mg daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> 10 mg once daily.</p><p>The choice of drug should take into consideration the type of antihypertensive agent that is most appropriate in the long term (eg, calcium channel blockers or thiazide-like diuretics may be slightly more effective than ACE inhibitors or beta blockers as monotherapy in blacks) and underlying conditions that may be favorably or adversely affected by the antihypertensive agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63628 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in blacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some experts initiate therapy with two drugs or a combination agent in such patients. The rationale is that most patients with a blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;20/10</span> mmHg above goal will require two or more chronic antihypertensive agents to achieve the goal blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults/abstract/2,11,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,22,23</a>]. If, in a previously untreated patient with severe asymptomatic hypertension, the goal is to lower the blood pressure over a period of days (rather than hours) and to use a combination of drugs that will be continued as long-term antihypertensive therapy, we would begin a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker plus a long-acting ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB</span>. This choice is based upon the results of the ACCOMPLISH trial, which is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'First-line combination therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'ACCOMPLISH trial'</a>.)</p><p>It is unlikely that a combination of two long-acting drugs in modest doses will cause a rapid and dangerous reduction in blood pressure. However, initiation of two agents simultaneously must be done with close blood pressure follow-up since the full effects of both agents may not occur for a few days and adverse consequences may ensue if the blood pressure is lowered too quickly. This is particularly true among patients with cerebrovascular disease in whom more cautious blood pressure reduction is generally warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring and follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with severe asymptomatic hypertension is usually managed in the emergency department since exclusion of acute end-organ damage requires laboratory testing and the patient may require administration of medications and several hours of observation. However, the patient can often be safely managed in the clinician's office if the evaluation and management can be carried out in that setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-the-hypertensive-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of the hypertensive adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of a patient who does not have established follow-up is difficult. Rarely, such patients may require admission. In addition, patients at high risk for acute cardiovascular events (eg, longstanding diabetes, known coronary artery disease or prior stroke) should probably be admitted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular risks of hypertension&quot;, section on 'Additive effects of hypertension and other risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, the patient should be observed for a few hours to ascertain that the blood pressure is stable or improving, that they indeed remain asymptomatic, and that they have received referral to an appropriate source of long-term medical care. If this occurs, the patient can be sent home with close follow-up over the subsequent days directed toward evaluation for symptoms related to hypertension or hypotension and adjustment of medications to achieve the initial blood pressure goal of <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;160/100</span> mmHg. In reliable patients who can monitor their blood pressure at home, close phone follow-up may substitute for direct clinician visits.

Much more common, however, is the relatively or completely asymptomatic patient with a blood pressure in the &quot;severe&quot; range (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;180/&ge;120</span> mmHg), often a mild headache, but <strong>no </strong>signs or symptoms of acute end-organ damage. This entity of severe asymptomatic hypertension is sometimes called hypertensive urgency. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal management of patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension is unclear. However, in such patients, our overall approach is as follows (see <a href=\"#H8275477\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest lowering the blood pressure over a period of hours to days rather than longer periods of time (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The rapidity with which blood pressure should be brought to safe levels is controversial and <strong>not</strong> based upon high-quality medical evidence. This suggestion stems from and seeks to balance two major concerns. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The risk of adverse events (eg, stroke or myocardial infarction) that may occur if the blood pressure is lowered too rapidly or to a level below the ability for autoregulation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The potential risk of imminent cardiovascular events that may result from severe hypertension if the blood pressure is not quickly and sufficiently reduced. In patients visiting an emergency department for severe hypertension, potential legal ramifications partially motivate lowering the blood pressure over several hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Over this period, we suggest lowering the blood pressure to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;160/&lt;100</span> mmHg or to a level that is no more than 25 to 30 percent lower than the baseline blood pressure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Thus, the short-term blood pressure target may need to be above <span class=\"nowrap\">160/100</span> mmHg in patients who present with very high pressures, because cerebral or myocardial ischemia or infarction, or acute kidney injury, can be induced by rapid and aggressive antihypertensive therapy if the blood pressure falls below the range at which tissue perfusion can be maintained by autoregulation. This approach has not been well studied and is based mostly upon experience. In the long-term, the blood pressure should usually be reduced further (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/&lt;90</span> mmHg). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure reduction goal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are a variety of options for lowering the blood pressure in patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension. All patients should be provided a quiet room in which to rest. This may produce a fall in blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;20/10</span> mmHg in approximately one-third of adults. If this is not effective, antihypertensive drugs may be given. The antihypertensive strategy depends upon whether the goal is to lower the blood pressure more quickly (period of hours) or less quickly (period of days) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic strategies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>To lower the blood pressure over a period of hours, some use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> (but should not be maintained as long-term therapy) or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> (if the patient is not volume overloaded). However, <strong>sublingual </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a><strong> is contraindicated</strong> in this setting and should <strong>not</strong> be used. (See <a href=\"#H3453412\" class=\"local\">'When the pressure should be lowered over a period of hours'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>To lower the blood pressure over a period of days, our approach depends upon the circumstances. In general, the treatment is resumption of antihypertensive therapy (in nonadherent patients), initiation of antihypertensive therapy (if patients are treatment na&iuml;ve), or the addition of another antihypertensive drug (in patients who are currently treated). (See <a href=\"#H3453418\" class=\"local\">'When the pressure should be lowered over a period of days'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with severe asymptomatic hypertension is usually managed in the emergency department since exclusion of acute end-organ damage requires laboratory testing, and the patient may (depending on local policies and procedures) require administration of medications and several hours of observation. However, the patient can often be safely managed in the clinician's office if the evaluation and management can be carried out in that setting. The management of a patient who does not have established follow-up is difficult. Rarely, such patients may require admission. In addition, patients at high risk for acute cardiovascular events (eg, longstanding diabetes, known coronary artery disease or prior stroke) should probably be admitted. Ideally, if treated acutely, patients should be observed for a few hours to ascertain that the blood pressure is stable or improving, that they indeed remain asymptomatic, and that they have received referral to an appropriate source of long-term medical care.
