Both the gravida and her family benefit from factual, nonjudgmental information about the maternal and fetal risks of substance use and from counseling about options for cessation. However, substance users may not seek prenatal care because of fear, guilt and shame, as well as concerns about medical and legal intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Opioid users may not even realize that they are pregnant if they are not planning pregnancy and misinterpret the early signs of pregnancy as opioid withdrawal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, cramping). Unintended pregnancy is common in these women; in one study, 86 percent of pregnant opioid-using women reported their pregnancy was unintended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Pregnant women are typically highly motivated to modify their behavior in order to help their unborn child. In a national survey from the United States, the mean rate of pregnancy-related abstinence among users of illicit drugs was 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Dysfunction in these circuits leads the individual to pathologically pursue reward <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relief by substance use and other behaviors. It is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one&rsquo;s behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. It often involves cycles of relapse and remission.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172227321\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG USE IN THE UNITED STATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Illicit drugs include <span class=\"nowrap\">marijuana/hashish,</span> cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, and prescription psychotherapeutics used non-medically. Results from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which interviewed over 67,500 civilian noninstitutionalized persons aged 12 years and older in the United States, revealed marijuana was the most commonly used illicit drug, followed by (in decreasing order of frequency) non-medical use of psychotherapeutics, cocaine, and hallucinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] &#160; In the non-medical use of psychotherapeutics group, the most commonly used drugs were pain relievers, followed by tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. </p><p>When interviewed in 2013, 5.4 percent of pregnant women stated that they had used illicit substances in the past month, and a much larger proportion smoked cigarettes (15.4 percent) or drank alcohol (9.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The rates of illicit drug use among pregnant women by age group were: age 15 to 17 years, 14.6&nbsp;percent; age 18 to 25 years, 8.6&nbsp;percent; age 26 to 44 years, 3.2 percent. Many women use more than one substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Use of some substances appears to be increasing. A study of pregnant women in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system reported that marijuana use in the prior month, determined by toxicology studies and self-report, increased from 4 percent in 2009 to 7 percent in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The greatest increase in use was reported for patients age 12 to 17 years (12.5 to 21.8 percent).</p><p>In the United States, as maternal drug use has increased, so have neonatal admissions and adverse health outcomes in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a study of over 650,000 infants born in the United States between 2004 and 2013, neonatal abstinence syndrome cases increased from 7 to 27 cases per 1000 neonatal intensive care units (NICU) admissions and median length of stay for these infants increased from 13 to 19 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The total percentage of NICU days nationwide that were attributed to the neonatal abstinence syndrome increased from 0.6 to 4.0 percent, with eight centers reporting that more than 20 percent of all NICU days were attributed to the care of these infants in 2013. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal abstinence syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR DRUG USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple societies and agencies consider screening for substance abuse a part of complete obstetric care and recommend asking all pregnant women about their use of alcohol and illicit drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. This recommendation is based on the prevalence of substance abuse in the population, its adverse effects, and data from mostly nonrandomized studies that intervention (education, prenatal care, treatment of substance abuse) can improve some maternal and neonatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. Screening followed by intervention can be cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Ideally, screening is performed at the initial prenatal visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and repeat screening is performed periodically during pregnancy (eg, each trimester). Since those who use substances come from all socioeconomic strata, ages, and races, consistent and repeated screening is advised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one report, a prenatal care system that did not routinely screen for substance abuse identified less than one-third of women who subsequently had a child removed from the home because of parental substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Denial is a significant barrier to identifying these patients. Denial may exist even when the patient is directly asked about drug use or confronted with behaviors suspicious for use. Pregnant women may not admit to drug use because they have guilt about its effect on their pregnancy, and fear legal consequences, including involvement of child protection agencies and loss of custody of their children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Some states consider substance abuse during pregnancy to be child abuse and a few consider it grounds for involuntary commitment to a treatment facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Providers should be aware of local laws and reporting requirements, which vary widely. </p><p>Objective screening (eg, urine testing) overcomes some of these barriers, but is more costly and has other limitations. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172230096\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of validated screening tools is recommended, but the options are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The 4P&rsquo;s Plus Screen for substance use in pregnancy consists of questions about substance use by the patient (in the past or currently), her parents, and her partner. An affirmative response should trigger further assessment (see <a href=\"#H14204097\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of screen positive patients'</a> below). However, the 4P&rsquo;s Plus Screen is a copyrighted screening instrument that may not be reproduced in any form without permission.</p><p>The CRAFFT Substance Abuse Screen for Adolescents and Young Adults is available for use without restriction. It has had preliminary testing among pregnant young adults and was found to be better than the medical record and the T-ACE alcohol screen for identification of prenatal substance use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Data on using the CRAFFT tool in older women are pending. Two or more positive responses to the following questions indicate the need for further assessment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong> &ndash; Have you ever ridden in a <strong>CAR</strong> driven by someone (including yourself) who was high or had been using alcohol or drugs?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong> &ndash; Do you ever use alcohol or drugs to <strong>RELAX</strong>, feel better about yourself or fit in?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong> &ndash; Do you ever use alcohol or drugs while you are by yourself or <strong>ALONE</strong>?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong> &ndash; Do you ever <strong>FORGET</strong> things you did while using alcohol or drugs?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong> &ndash; Do your <strong>FAMILY</strong> or <strong>friends</strong> ever tell you that you should cut down on your drinking or drug use?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>T</strong> &ndash; Have you ever gotten in <strong>TROUBLE</strong> while you were using alcohol or drugs?</p><p/><p>For older women, we use the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Quick Screen question (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109834 \">table 1</a>). While the screen was validated in the primary care population and not in pregnant women, benefits include that it quantifies substance use and includes both illicit and prescription drugs. </p><p>Additional screening tools that show promise in preliminary studies include the TAPS tool (tobacco, alcohol, prescription medications, and substance <span class=\"nowrap\">use/misuse),</span> the Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy (SURP-P), and the Wayne Indirect Drug Use Screener (WIDUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].

It is preferable to begin with questions about lawful substances, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol, followed by questions about misuse of over-the-counter drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a> products and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a> products, and then use of prescription drugs (opioid analgesics, sedatives, stimulants, tranquilizers), and, finally, illegal substances (marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, and inhalants).</p><p>Ask about the frequency of drug use, length of the most recent pattern of use, and time of last use. It may be helpful to ask about where, when, and with whom drugs are most often used.</p><p>When appropriate, determine the route of administration: oral, intranasal, subcutaneous injection (&quot;skin popping&quot;), or intravenous. If she has ever used a needle to inject drugs, ask about shared needles.</p><p>For each substance, ask about the quantity used (ie, quantity of powder, unit of sale from a dealer). Terms used for drug units vary regionally, and it is helpful to be familiar with local drug slang and to ask for explanations of unfamiliar terms. The amount of money spent on a <span class=\"nowrap\">daily/weekly/monthly</span> basis for drugs may also be used to quantitate drug usage. However, information about the quantity of drug use is not helpful in determining if an individual has <span class=\"nowrap\">abuse/dependence</span> and is not likely to be accurately reported. </p><p>Ask about participation in self-help programs such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA), prior detoxification or addiction treatment, and abstinence periods.

Marijuana (cannabis) is the most common illicit substance used during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Prevalence of marijuana use during pregnancy varies according to maternal age, racial or ethnic background, and socioeconomic status.

In addition, perceived lack of risk from marijuana use during pregnancy as well as actual use appear to be increasing in the United States, likely as a result of legalization and changing social attitudes. As an example, a study from the United States National Survey on Drug Use and Health database reported that the percent of women who believed that regular marijuana use was of no risk during pregnancy increased from 4.6 percent in 2005 to 19 percent in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Methamphetamine, commonly known as speed, meth, and chalk, or as ice, crystal, and glass when smoked, is a powerfully addictive stimulant.

Given the potential adverse fetal and maternal effects of drug use, we recommend screening all pregnant women for drug use (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Screening for drug use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most practical screening method is to ask specific questions about drug use using a screening tool. Pregnant women may not admit drug use because of guilt about its effect on their pregnancy, and fear legal consequences, including loss of custody of children. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Screening for drug use'</a> above and <a href=\"#H172230096\" class=\"local\">'Screening tools'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for increased likelihood of substance abuse include late initiation of prenatal care, multiple missed prenatal visits, past adverse obstetrical history, children with neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems, children not living with the mother, history of drug or alcohol mediated medical problems, substance abuse in a partner or family member, and frequent encounters with law enforcement agencies. (See <a href=\"#H96349768\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for substance use'</a> above.) Universal laboratory testing for evidence of drug use is not recommended because of the limitations of these tests. Possible clinical indications for laboratory testing after informed consent in selected pregnant women include: previous positive drug test, monitoring compliance with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> use, unexplained abruptio placenta or fetal demise. Clinicians should be aware of their state&rsquo;s requirements for testing and reporting drug test results. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few randomized trials have evaluated the optimum approach to management of pregnant substance abusers. Observational studies suggest that combining treatment of substance abuse with comprehensive prenatal care can reduce the frequency of some maternal and neonatal complications of maternal substance use. Components of this care should be individualized based on patient-specific factors. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'General principles of prenatal care of the substance user'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women dependent on opiates, we suggest opiate substitution treatment rather than medical detoxification or no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> may be used; neither drug is clearly superior, but there is more experience with methadone. Methadone use is associated with fewer <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> complications and side effects than detoxification or continued use of un-prescribed opiates. (See <a href=\"#H4892499\" class=\"local\">'Opioid-substitution therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cocaine can cause vasoconstriction of uterine vessels, which is the probable major mechanism for fetal and placental injury leading to abruptio placentae, spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and fetal death. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Cocaine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no high quality evidence showing an adverse effect of marijuana on pregnancy outcome. Because data are conflicting, marijuana use is discouraged during pregnancy and lactation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Marijuana'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive information on the impact of exposure to methamphetamine in utero is not available.
