Urinary tract infections happen when bacteria get into the urethra and travel up into the bladder. If the infection stays just in the bladder, it is a called a bladder infection, or &quot;cystitis.&quot; If the infection travels up past the bladder and into the kidneys, it is called a kidney infection or &quot;pyelonephritis.&quot;</p><p>Bladder infections are one of the most common infections, causing symptoms of burning with urination and needing to urinate frequently. Kidney infections are less common than bladder infections, and they can cause similar symptoms, but they can also cause fever, back pain, and nausea or vomiting. </p><p>Both bladder and kidney infections are more common in women than men. Most women have an uncomplicated bladder infection that is easily treated with a short course of antibiotics. In men, bladder infections may also affect the prostate gland, and a longer course of treatment may be needed. Kidney infections can also usually be treated at home with antibiotics, but treatment typically lasts longer. In some cases, kidney infections must be treated in the hospital. </p><p>This discussion will focus on bladder and kidney infections in a healthy adult. Urinary tract infections in children are discussed in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY TRACT INFECTION CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteria do not normally live in the urinary tract, but they do live close to the urethra in women and men who are not circumcised. Urinary tract infections occur when these bacteria get into the urethra and travel up into the urinary tract.</p><p>Factors that increase the risk of developing a urinary tract infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having sex frequently or having a new sex partner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a bladder or kidney infection in the past 12 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a spermicide for birth control </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men, not being circumcised or having insertive anal sex </p><p/><p>In men and women, having a condition (such as kidney stones or ureteral reflux) that blocks or changes the flow of urine in the kidneys increases the risk of a kidney infection. </p><p>There is increasing evidence that there is a genetic predisposition to urinary tract infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BLADDER INFECTION SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical symptoms of a bladder infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or burning when urinating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent need to urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgent need to urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discomfort in the lower abdomen</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26421652\"><span class=\"h2\">Is it a bladder infection or something else?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burning with urination can also occur in women with vaginal infections (such as a yeast infection) or in people with urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). For this reason, it is important to call your healthcare provider before assuming you have a bladder infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26421610\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY INFECTION SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney infections can sometimes cause the same symptoms as those of a bladder infection (listed above), but they can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature higher than 99.9<sup>&#9702;</sup>F or 37.7<sup>&#9702;</sup>C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the flank (one or both sides of the lower back, where the kidneys are located)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p>If you have one or more of the symptoms of a kidney infection, you should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. Although most kidney infections do not cause permanent damage, delaying treatment can lead to serious complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY TRACT INFECTION DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tract infections can often be diagnosed based upon the person's symptoms. In some cases, no further testing is needed. If you are a woman and your symptoms are typical for bladder infection and you do not have vaginal irritation or discharge, it is very likely that you have a urinary tract infection. In such cases, your provider will usually treat you without ordering urine tests. In other cases, a urine test to check for the presence of white blood cells in the urine and a urine culture are used to help make the diagnosis. </p><p>White blood cells are responsible for fighting infection, so their presence in the urine suggests infection. </p><p>A urine culture is a test that uses a sample of urine to try and grow bacteria in a laboratory. It usually requires about 48 hours to get results. </p><p>Urine tests, including a urine culture, are often performed in men and in women who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a suspected kidney infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have symptoms that are not typical for bladder infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had &quot;resistant&quot; bladder infections before (meaning the infections did not get better with standard antibiotics)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have used antibiotics recently</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have frequent bladder infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not begin to feel better within 24 to 48 hours after starting antibiotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are pregnant</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">BLADDER INFECTION TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In young, healthy adolescents and adults with a bladder infection, the usual treatment includes a single dose to a five-day course of antibiotics. The typical drugs chosen are: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), nitrofurantoin (Macrobid), and fosfomycin (Monurol). </p><p>In men, the infection may involve the prostate gland and treatment is usually given for a slightly longer duration.</p><p>Your symptoms should begin to resolve within one day after starting treatment. It is important to take the full course of antibiotics to completely eliminate the infection. If your symptoms persist for more than two or three days after starting treatment, call your healthcare provider.</p><p>If needed, you can take a prescription medication that numbs the bladder and urethra (phenazopyridine [Pyridium]) to reduce the burning pain of some UTIs. A similar medication is available over the counter without a prescription (eg, Uristat). Both medications change the color of the urine (usually to orange or red), can interfere with laboratory testing, and may stain fabric and contact lenses. You should not take these medications for more than 48 hours, as there is no proven benefit beyond 48 hours and side effects may increase. These medications do not treat the urinary tract infection and must be taken along with an antibiotic.</p><p>Some providers recommend drinking more fluids while treating bladder infections to help flush bacteria from the bladder. No studies have been performed to address this issue.</p><p>There are also no good studies on the effectiveness of cranberry juice for treating a bladder infection; we do not recommend using cranberry juice to treat bladder infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up testing is not needed in healthy, young men or women with a bladder infection if symptoms resolve. Pregnant women are usually asked to have a repeat urine culture one to two weeks after treatment has ended to make sure the bacteria are no longer in the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26421703\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY INFECTION TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for a kidney infection depends upon the severity of the infection and the person's general health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26421710\"><span class=\"h2\">Home treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your fever and pain are mild and you are able to eat and drink, you will probably be given a one to two week course of antibiotics to take by mouth at home. The first dose of antibiotics may be given as an injection in the office, clinic, or emergency department. Let your healthcare provider know if you do not begin to feel better within one to two days after starting treatment.</p><p>For fever and pain, you can take a nonprescription medication like acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26421717\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a high fever, severe pain, or cannot keep down <span class=\"nowrap\">food/fluids,</span> you will need to be hospitalized and given intravenous (IV) antibiotics and fluids. As you begin to improve, you will be allowed to go home and continue taking oral antibiotics there.</p><p>Most pregnant women with a kidney infection are hospitalized and treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and fluids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT BLADDER INFECTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder infections versus other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some adults, especially women, develop bladder infections frequently. In this case, it is important to confirm at least once that your symptoms (eg, burning, frequency, and urgency) are caused by a bladder infection. Symptoms are usually similar from one infection to another. As noted above, the best way to confirm an infection is to have urine tests, including a urine culture, performed. However, if your symptoms are typical for bladder infection and you do not have vaginal irritation or discharge, your provider will usually treat you without ordering a urine culture. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract infection diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>If a urine culture is performed and is negative for infection, other causes of pain, burning, and frequency should be considered. However, some urinary tract infections are caused by small quantities of bacteriuria that may not be detected on a typical urine culture. Therefore, in some cases your provider may choose to continue you on antibiotics even if the culture is reported to be negative.

This is especially true if there is a chance you could have an abnormality in the kidneys, ureter, bladder, or urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>), or if you could have a kidney stone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tests for these conditions may include a computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, or cystoscopy (looking inside the bladder with a thin, lighted telescope-like instrument).</p><p>If you continue to notice blood in your urine after your bladder infection has cleared, you should have further testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing recurrent UTIs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with recurrent urinary tract infections may be advised to take steps to prevent bladder infections, including one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Changes in birth control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who develop frequent bladder infections and use spermicides, particularly those who also use a diaphragm, may be encouraged to use an alternate method of birth control.

(Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Cranberry products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking cranberry juice, cranberry tablets, or D-mannose has been promoted as one way to help prevent frequent bladder infections. However, several studies demonstrate no benefit with cranberry, and those studies showing that cranberry and D-mannose reduce the risk of recurrent bladder infections are not convincing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Drinking more fluid and urinating after intercourse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although studies have not proven that drinking more fluids or urinating soon after intercourse can prevent infection, some healthcare providers recommend these measures since they are not harmful. Drinking more fluid may help to wash out bacteria that enter the bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postmenopausal women who develop recurrent bladder infections may benefit from using vaginal estrogen. Vaginal estrogen is available in a flexible ring that is worn in the vagina for three months (eg, Estring), a small vaginal insert (Vagifem), or a cream (eg, Premarin or Estrace). Vaginal estrogen is discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preventive antibiotic treatment may be recommended if you repeatedly develop bladder infections and have not responded to other preventive measures. Antibiotics are highly effective in preventing recurrent bladder infections but can cause side effects and promote the growth of resistant bacteria, which are more difficult to treat if they cause subsequent urinary tract infections. Therefore, antibiotics for preventing urinary tract infections should only be considered after trying the above preventive approaches. Preventive antibiotics can be taken in several different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous antibiotics &ndash; You can take a low dose of an antibiotic once per day or three times per week for several months to several years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics following intercourse &ndash; In women who develop urinary tract infections after sex, taking a single low dose antibiotic after intercourse can help to prevent bladder infections. This usually results in less antibiotic use than continuous antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-treatment &ndash; A plan to begin antibiotics at the first sign of a bladder infection may be recommended in some situations. Before starting this regimen, it is important that you have had testing (urine cultures) to confirm that your symptoms are caused by a bladder infection; some people have symptoms of a bladder infection but do not actually have an infection.
