The clinical syndrome is characterized by the development of dyspnea, often associated with accumulation of fluid within the lung's interstitial and alveolar spaces, which is the result of acutely elevated cardiac filling pressures (cardiogenic pulmonary edema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ADHF can also present as elevated left ventricular filling pressures and dyspnea without pulmonary edema.</p><p>ADHF is most commonly due to left ventricular systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic dysfunction, with or without additional cardiac pathology, such as coronary artery disease or valve abnormalities. However, a variety of conditions or events can cause pulmonary edema due to an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the absence of heart disease, including primary fluid overload (eg, due to blood transfusion), severe hypertension, and severe renal disease.</p><p>General considerations related to the management of ADHF in patients with and without acute myocardial infarction (MI) will be reviewed here. The components of therapy of ADHF and the pathophysiology and evaluation of patients with ADHF are presented separately.

The Heart Failure Society of America guidelines recommend more than daily monitoring of vital signs (including orthostatic blood pressure) and at least daily monitoring of weight, fluid intake and output, symptoms and signs of congestion, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and oxygen saturation until stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Serum potassium and magnesium levels should be monitored at least daily, and more frequent monitoring may be required when diuresis is rapid. Routine tests include blood glucose, troponin, complete blood count, and the International Normalized Ratio if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is used. Evaluation of liver function tests, and urinalysis is frequently indicated and arterial blood gas testing is occasionally indicated (eg, to detect carbon dioxide retention). Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP can be of value in clarifying the cardiac basis of respiratory distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> guiding therapy. Telemetry is usually continued for at least 24 to 48 hours.

The treatment of chronic HF, particularly when due to systolic dysfunction, is built around therapies that have been shown to reduce long-term mortality and improve symptoms (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers).</p><p>In contrast, the goals of the initial management of ADHF are hemodynamic stabilization, support of oxygenation and ventilation, and symptom relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some of the cornerstones of chronic HF therapy should not be added or should be used with caution in ADHF (eg, beta blockers), particularly during the period of initial stabilization.

Among patients with systolic dysfunction, some medications should not be initiated or should be used with caution in the acute setting (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers). In contrast, for patients with primarily diastolic dysfunction, treatment of hypertension and tachycardia is particularly important. Inotropic agents are not indicated in patients with diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ARRHYTHMIA MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias can occur in association with pulmonary edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia, particularly in patients with underlying heart disease. Among patients with both heart failure (HF) and AF, there are several possible relationships:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute HF can precipitate AF due to increases in left atrial pressure and wall stress</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AF can cause acute HF, particularly if the ventricular response is rapid.

A reliable history of palpitations that clearly precede the decompensation suggests but does not prove that AF was the cause of the pulmonary edema. The treatment of AF depends upon whether or not it is associated with significant hemodynamic instability and whether or not it is believed to be the precipitant of HF decompensation.</p><p>In some patients with AF and ADHF, effective treatment of pulmonary edema results in slowing of the ventricular rate or spontaneous reversion of the arrhythmia. If AF persists, it is treated in the same fashion as AF in other situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rate control is often the preferred initial strategy for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because acute HF can precipitate AF, cardioversion prior to the resolution of acute HF will often be followed by early recurrence of AF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AF is often a chronic condition that is not contributing to the acute decompensation</p><p/><p>However, if a rate control strategy is selected, the negative inotropic effects of beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be problematic in patients with systolic dysfunction. For this reason, short-acting intravenous formulations of such drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>) are often used.

Flash pulmonary edema appears to be more common in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis as compared to those with unilateral disease (eg, 41 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Acute treatment of acute decompensate HF in patients with this syndrome includes blood pressure control and, in some cases, diuresis. In patients who are euvolemic or dehydrated, diuresis should be avoided, as it may lead to renal insufficiency, and preload reduction with nitrates is preferable.</p><p>Only limited observational data are available on the efficacy of revascularization for this condition.

Several factors have been identified as predictors of better short-term outcome and likely reflect the degree of diuresis, including weight loss, clinical signs of improvement in congestion, and the rise in albumin or hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE FROM HOSPITAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful in-hospital management and discharge planning is indicated to reduce the risk of post-discharge mortality and readmission.

Discharge planning should address details of medication, dietary sodium restriction, and recommended activity level; early follow-up by phone or clinic visit; compliance; monitoring of body weight, electrolytes, and renal function; and consideration of referral for formal disease management. </p><p>Although most patients respond well to therapy for decompensated heart failure (HF) in the hospital where diuretics are generally administered intravenously and dietary <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/fluid</span> intake are regulated, it is often difficult to predict an effective outpatient diuretic regimen. One way of improving the selection of an effective outpatient diuretic regimen is to convert from intravenous to oral diuretics two or more days prior to discharge. Even when this is done, further dose adjustment is often needed after the patient returns to the home environment where salt and fluid intake is less well regulated.</p><p>The importance of early outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge was illustrated by a study of 30,136 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for HF at 225 hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The rate of 30-day hospital readmission was slightly but significantly higher (23.3 versus 20.5 percent) in the quartile of hospitals with the lowest rates of early (within seven days) follow-up than in the next quartile (early follow-up rate &lt;32.4 percent versus 32.4 to 37.9 percent). The difference in readmission rates remained significant after adjustment for baseline patient characteristics.</p><p>Comprehensive written discharge instructions are recommended for all patients hospitalized for HF and their caregivers with special emphasis on the following issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-self-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure self-management&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet (including dietary sodium restriction).

Daily assessment of patient weight may be the most effective method for documenting effective diuresis. For accurate comparisons, daily measurements should use the same scale and should be performed at the same time each day, usually in the morning, prior to eating and after voiding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment goals for patients admitted with ADHF include improving symptoms, optimizing volume status, identifying etiology and precipitating factors (particularly ischemia), initiating and optimizing oral therapy, minimizing side effects, educating patients, and considering a disease management program.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following initial therapies are similar in systolic and diastolic HF: diuresis, supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation, and vasodilator therapy in selected patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some medications should be avoided or used with caution in the acute setting (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and beta-blockers) in patients with systolic dysfunction. In patients on ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, the medications can be continued if the patient is relatively stable (eg, just needs diuresis). Inotropic agents are not indicated in patients with diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation can precipitate ADHF and ADHF can promote atrial fibrillation (AF). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An initial strategy of rate control is reasonable if AF does not appear to be the precipitant of ADHF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restoration of sinus rhythm should be considered if AF is associated with hypotension or cardiogenic shock, if AF is the cause for pulmonary edema, or if the response to therapy of pulmonary edema is suboptimal.
