Overdose, both intentional and unintentional, has also become the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, exceeding the number of deaths due to firearms, falls, or motorized vehicle collisions.</p><p>Severely poisoned patients may present <em>in extremis</em>. Such patients require an organized, targeted resuscitation despite incomplete, uncertain, or even erroneous information. A &quot;generic&quot; approach based upon the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols intended for cardiac patients is suboptimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It can lead to missed opportunities for specific life-saving interventions and may at times be harmful.</p><p>This topic will describe an approach to the resuscitation of the critically ill poisoned adult patient when the identity of the agent(s) ingested is initially unknown. The general approach to the poisoned patient and the management of specific poisonings are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30959739\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL DATA ACQUISITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any readily available information about the patient and the poisoning should be obtained from prehospital care providers, other first responders (including witnesses, firemen, police, friends, and family), and from medical records. Medication or chemical product containers, material safety data sheets, pharmacy records, and institutional or patient lists of prescribed medication can be helpful. In addition, the setting and circumstances may help to identify the toxin(s) involved and select interventions. As examples, misadventures with recreational drugs of abuse or accidental industrial exposures suggest the need to prepare for multiple victims, whereas a person who rapidly decompensates after being taken into police custody may have &quot;stuffed&quot; (eg, swallowed) large amounts of illicit drugs and immediate removal of the leaking package may be life-saving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

These priorities are addressed concurrently as part of the primary assessment.</p><p>Multiple casualty and mass casualty incidents may involve toxic exposures and challenge health care systems of any size. Even a single patient contaminated or potentially contaminated with a highly potent toxin (eg, a radioactive isotope or nerve agent such as sarin) can disable an entire emergency department (ED).</p><p>Rarely, potent agents can directly threaten the health of clinicians when proper protection is not used. Therefore, special care is needed when decontaminating patients with possible toxic exposures. Decontamination should be performed prior to arrival or outside the ED. Soiled clothing and bodily fluids should be placed in appropriate containers and disposed of properly. Decontamination procedures and the chemical and biologic agents likely to be involved in an exposure are discussed separately.

The class of toxin involved may be suggested by characteristic combinations of symptoms and signs (so-called &quot;toxidromes&quot;). The &quot;toxidrome-oriented&quot; physical examination consists of: vital signs; level of alertness; pupil size and position; mucous membrane moisture and secretions; skin temperature and moisture; presence or absence of bowel sounds; and motor tone. Alertness can be categorized simply as alert, responsive to voice, responsive to pain, or unresponsive. The findings of this rapid initial examination may provide valuable insight into the class of toxin involved. The major toxidromes and their associated findings are summarized in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 1</a>). Disturbances in temperature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55439 \">table 2</a>), heart rate and blood pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51200 \">table 3</a>), and respiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64012 \">table 4</a>) can also suggest a toxin class.</p><p>In addition to the findings above, the clinician should look for signs of trauma (self-inflicted or accidental), recent intravenous drug use, transdermal patches, and seizures (eg, incontinence, lateral tongue laceration). Cervical spine precautions may be needed if major trauma is suspected.</p><p>The clinical team should immediately obtain intravenous access, apply a cardiac monitor, obtain a pulse oximeter reading, and provide high flow oxygen by non-rebreather face mask.

The steps are organized according to the issues that pose the most immediate life threats; problems are managed immediately in the order encountered.

One exception is when the clinical scenario suggests opioid overdose; in these cases, administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> while assuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Use small doses initially (eg, 0.05 mg intravenously or 0.1 mg intramuscularly), doubling the dose until reversal of respiratory depression is achieved. Severe hypoglycemia should also be ruled out as a cause of depressed mental status prior to intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic measures and antidotal therapy'</a>.) </p><p>Do <strong>not</strong> administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> for presumed or known benzodiazepine overdose, as the risk benefit ratio of this agent is poor and withdrawal seizures can develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In organophosphate poisoning, succinylcholine may have a markedly prolonged duration of action, as the cholinesterases which degrade it are inactivated by the toxin. Digoxin poisoning may produce hyperkalemia, a contraindication to succinylcholine use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;, section on 'Initial resuscitation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digitalis (cardiac glycoside) poisoning&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p>Patients with a caustic ingestion who manifest stridor and drooling are ideally intubated early by the most experienced clinician available using an awake approach. An alternate strategy for securing the airway, and the means to establish a surgical airway if necessary, must be immediately available.

Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause severe hypoxia despite falsely normal pulse oximetry readings. In cases of methemoglobinemia, the pulse oximeter may read around 85 percent despite visible cyanosis. Other toxicologic causes of cellular hypoxia despite normal oxygen saturation include cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, and sodium azide. Patients with profound tissue hypoxia from these toxins require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation using 100 percent oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyanide poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> poisoning are initially tachypneic and hyperpneic due to the stimulatory effects of aspirin upon the respiratory center of the medulla. This hyperventilation is beneficial and intubation should be avoided if possible because it is difficult to replicate such high minute ventilation with mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, patients unable to protect their airway must be intubated and hyperventilated. Severe aspirin poisoning can cause precipitous decompensation and death shortly after intubation, and such patients require specific and aggressive resuscitation, including treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, high minute ventilation, and immediate hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'Airway and breathing'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with profound metabolic acidosis due to other toxins (eg, methanol, ethylene glycol) can also develop extremely high compensatory minute ventilation. These patients may be acidemic despite a PaCO<sub>2</sub> near 10 mmHg. When this high minute ventilation rate slows (eg, due to seizures, fatigue, or iatrogenic sedation or paralysis), the arterial pH falls abruptly, sometimes below 6.8 or 6.9. As such, patients with severe metabolic acidosis due to poisoning are at risk of decompensating rapidly from respiratory failure. Such patients should be intubated for any sign of respiratory failure, either clinically or on blood gas testing. In particular, a seemingly normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 30 to 40 mmHg in the face of a severe metabolic acidosis is evidence of respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;, section on 'Airway, breathing, circulation'</a>.)</p><p>When intubating hyperpneic patients with severe metabolic acidosis, we suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer one to three 50 mL amps of 7.5 to 8.4 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> via intravenous bolus before and after intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sedation until just prior to tracheal intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimize the likelihood of first-pass success by using appropriate neuromuscular blockade and sound technique; an experienced intubator should perform the procedure (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximize minute ventilation once intubated, while following peak airway pressures and arterial blood gases.

Treat these symptoms with intravenous dextrose when the glucometer reports a low or low-normal capillary blood glucose.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naloxone</a> is indicated for the reversal of respiratory depression in the setting of known or suspected opioid toxicity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic measures and antidotal therapy'</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flumazenil</a> should <strong>not</strong> be used, even when benzodiazepine toxicity is suspected, because it can precipitate benzodiazepine withdrawal, causing seizures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benzodiazepine poisoning and withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Antidote (flumazenil)'</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thiamine</a> may be administered safely before glucose, but is unlikely to reverse coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Physostigmine</a> is no longer used as a non-specific analeptic, but does play a selected role in the management of anticholinergic poisoning.

When seizures are likely due to sodium channel blockade, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> should be administered in addition to benzodiazepines. Dosing is described above (see <a href=\"#H7708080\" class=\"local\">'&ldquo;C&rdquo;: Circulation'</a> above). High doses of pyridoxine (5 g IV) should be given to patients in status epilepticus believed to be caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> overdose or monomethylhydrazine poisoning (eg, Gyromitra mushrooms).
