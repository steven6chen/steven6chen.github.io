It is treated with supportive measures (eg, fluid repletion and unrestricted diet). No specific antiviral agents are available for the treatment of acute viral gastroenteritis. (See <a href=\"#H236718105\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid repletion and replacement of ongoing fluid losses are the goals of therapy for acute viral gastroenteritis, whether the child is managed at home, in the emergency department, or in the hospital. Fluid repletion is based upon the degree of hypovolemia (dehydration) and presence of hyper- or hyponatremia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76198\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198 \">table 1</a>). Severe hypovolemia requires rapid intravenous isotonic fluid resuscitation. Oral rehydration therapy is the preferred first-line treatment for children with mild to moderate hypovolemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend resumption of an age-appropriate diet as soon as rehydration is complete (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Breastfeeding can continue during diarrhea. Within the age-appropriate diet, complex carbohydrates, lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables are better tolerated than foods containing high levels of fats and simple sugars. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limited disease that <strong>does not</strong> require pharmacologic therapy. We suggest not using antidiarrheal agents (eg, antimotility drugs, antisecretory drugs, adsorbents) in the treatment of acute viral gastroenteritis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Evidence of efficacy is weak and there is potential for serious side effects. (See <a href=\"#H236717971\" class=\"local\">'Antidiarrheal agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using antiemetics in the <strong>routine</strong> management of acute viral gastroenteritis in children (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, for children with suspected viral gastroenteritis, mild to moderate dehydration, and <strong>persistent vomiting</strong> that interferes with oral rehydration therapy (ORT), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ondansetron</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We administer a <strong>single</strong> <strong>oral</strong> dose of ondansetron 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum dose of 8 mg). Ondansetron is helpful in reducing vomiting to facilitate administration of ORT. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Antiemetic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions regarding the use of probiotics in acute viral gastroenteritis are made on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H344662588\" class=\"local\">'Probiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using zinc in the management of acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H236717984\" class=\"local\">'Zinc'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children who are admitted to the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluid repletion or cared for in a medical setting (eg, emergency department, office), minimum criteria for discharge to home include (see <a href=\"#H1818311933\" class=\"local\">'Discharge from the medical setting'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Repletion of fluid status, indicated by weight gain and improvement in clinical status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ability to meet maintenance fluid needs with oral intake (eg, volume of oral intake equals or surpasses output) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Follow-up (in person or by phone) is arranged</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Parents/caregivers</span> understand indications to return to medical care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions other than acute viral gastroenteritis must be considered in children who fail to respond to fluid therapy or whose clinical condition worsens despite fluid therapy.
