The diffuse gliomas are the most common types and generally affect the cerebral hemispheres of adults. They are classified based upon their line of differentiation and are graded according to their histologic degree of malignancy.</p><p>Diffuse gliomas are classified according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) system by both histologic and molecular characteristics as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant or IDH-wildtype astrocytomas; IDH-mutant and 1p19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas; and IDH-mutant or IDH-wildtype glioblastomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

High-grade gliomas contain multipotent tumor stem cells that are responsible for populating and repopulating the tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. These tumor stem cells may be transformed variants of normal neural progenitor cells. The existence of these tumor stem cells may have therapeutic implications, since therapies that do not ablate the tumor stem cells will be ineffective in eradicating the tumor. Nonetheless, the cell of origin of high-grade gliomas remains uncertain, and the possibility that these tumors arise from a fully differentiated cell type, such as a mature glial cell, has not been excluded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ADULT DIFFUSE GLIOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding of the molecular genetic basis of high-grade gliomas has increased markedly over the last two decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. This knowledge has provided insight into the biologic basis of high-grade glioma formation and progression. This information has permitted the generation of novel genetically engineered murine models of diffuse high-grade glioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Some of these molecular changes may represent potential targets for future gene or molecular pharmacologic therapies. However, single-agent therapeutic approaches may be confounded by the sometimes remarkable heterogeneity within individual high-grade gliomas, which has been demonstrated at the regional and cellular levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>As with other human cancers, the formation and progression of diffuse gliomas is accompanied by activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, abrogation of apoptotic genes, and deregulation of DNA repair genes, as well as extensive epigenetic alterations. Different constellations of genetic alterations are associated with specific types of high-grade gliomas, with particular tumor grades, and with differential sensitivities to specific therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Formation of astrocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The formation of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II astrocytoma is associated with at least three moderately common genetic alterations: heterozygous point mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) or less commonly <em>IDH2</em>; mutations in the chromatin regulator gene, <em>ATRX</em>; and inactivation of the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91840 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15072634\"><span class=\"h3\">Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic mutations affecting the active site of the Krebs cycle enzyme IDH1 were first identified in glioma in 2008 as part of a genomic analysis of human glioblastoma tumor samples, in which 18 out of 149 tumors (12 percent) contained alterations in <em>IDH1</em>, primarily at the R132 residue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Subsequent studies have confirmed these findings, identified rarer mutations in <em>IDH1</em> and the related gene <em>IDH2</em> in glioma, and extended the spectrum of involved tumors to include a much greater proportion of lower-grade gliomas than glioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Such mutations are the earliest known events in diffuse gliomagenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>].</p><p>A number of putative mechanisms have been suggested for IDH dysregulation in glioma formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterozygous mutations in <em>IDH1</em> foster the formation of an oncogenic metabolite, R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In leukemias, IDH mutation and 2HG production have been linked via DNA methylation changes to impaired hematopoietic cell differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similarly, in IDH-mutant gliomas, epigenetic dysregulation mediated by 2HG results in a CpG island methylator phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The functional importance of this phenotype in early glioma formation may relate in part to changes in insulator protein binding, resulting in aberrant activation of oncogenes such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<em>PDGFRA)</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IDH1 mutants may act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wildtype IDH1 function, exerting a tumorigenic effect through induction of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p><em>IDH1</em> or<em> IDH2</em> mutations are present in 50 to 80 percent of WHO grade II and III astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors and secondary glioblastomas as well as approximately 5 percent of primary glioblastomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25</a>]. <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em></span> mutations in glioma are associated with significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival compared with comparable tumors without an IDH mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].

Inactivation of the <em>TP53</em> gene, usually due to mutation of one copy and chromosomal loss of the remaining allele, occurs in approximately one-half of astrocytomas, approximately one-third of anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/7,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,36</a>], and the large majority of such tumors that also harbor IDH mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The <em>TP53</em> mutations are primarily missense mutations and target the evolutionarily conserved domains in exons 5, 7, and 8. Particular mutational hot spots include codons 175, 248, and 273, in which C to T transitions are most likely the result of spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues. These mutations affect p53 residues that are crucial for DNA binding, presumably leading to loss of p53-mediated function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><em>TP53</em> also plays a role in protecting cells from DNA damage.

These two events are typically found together in oligodendrogliomas, presumably on the basis of a single translocation event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Because of the frequent loss of these loci in low-grade as well as anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas, <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q</span> loss is probably important early in oligodendroglial tumorigenesis.

Loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q</span> occurs in the setting of <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em></span> mutation, suggesting that the chromosomal losses follow the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em></span> mutations. </p><p>The frequent codeletion of 1p and 19q in oligodendroglioma has suggested that these chromosomal arms may contain tumor suppressor genes, and several candidate genes have been identified.

Similarly, mutations in far upstream element binding protein 1 (<em>FUBP1</em>) on chromosome 1p have been observed in some oligodendrogliomas, although at a lower frequency than <em>CIC</em> alterations.</p><p>Telomere expression may also play a role in the pathogenesis of oligodendroglioma, but in a manner distinct from the <em>ATRX</em> pathway that has been implicated in astrocytoma. Point mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (<em>TERT</em>) gene promotor are present in the great majority of oligodendrogliomas, leading to increased telomerase expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Transition to high-grade glioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transition from low-grade to anaplastic glioma is associated with a variety of molecular alterations, including cell cycle checkpoint inactivation, tumor suppressor gene inactivation, and angiogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15072833\"><span class=\"h3\">Checkpoint alterations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of chromosome 13q, which includes the retinoblastoma (<em>RB</em>) gene locus, occurs in approximately one-third of higher-grade astrocytic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>One of the major pathways controlling the G1-S phase cell cycle checkpoint involves the p16, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)-4, cyclin D, and pRB (retinoblastoma) proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alterations of at least one component of this pathway occur in many anaplastic astrocytomas and in the vast majority of glioblastomas. The protein encoded by the <em>RB</em> gene, pRB, is important in cell-cycle arrest; the loss of pRB function in gliomas thereby removes an important brake on the cell cycle.</p><p>One upstream mediator of pRB function is the p16 product of the <em>CDKN2A</em> gene (also called <em>p16INK4A</em>) on chromosome 9p, a tumor suppressor inactivated in a number of human tumors. p16 inhibits the cyclin-cyclin dependent kinase complex that regulates pRB. The vast majority of glioma cell lines and two-thirds of high-grade astrocytic gliomas show homozygous deletions of chromosome 9p that include this gene. It is likely that these deletions result in loss of expression of the p16 and p14ARF transcripts from <em>CDKN2A </em>and the p15 transcript from the nearby <em>CDKN2B</em> (also called multiple tumor suppressor 2 [<em>MTS2</em>]), resulting in loss of multiple cell cycle control checkpoints and greater proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The cyclin dependent kinase 4 (<em>CDK4</em>) gene is amplified and overexpressed in 10 to 15 percent of high-grade gliomas. <em>CDK4</em> itself is regulated by p16 and inactivates pRB through phosphorylation. Thus, nearly all high-grade tumors have impairments of this single critical cell cycle control pathway. It is likely as well that less profound defects in cell cycle regulation occur in lower-grade gliomas; for instance, <em>TP53</em> gene mutations may affect both the G1-S and G2-M checkpoints.</p><p>In general, alterations of <em>RB</em>, <em>CDKN2A</em> and the <em>CDK4</em> gene are mutually exclusive in glioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15072839\"><span class=\"h3\">PTEN inactivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant progression to glioblastoma is also associated with inactivation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (<em>PTEN</em>) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Amplification of the <em>EGFR</em> gene is associated with progression from lower-grade astrocytoma to glioblastoma.

Approximately one-third of glioblastomas with <em>EGFR</em> gene amplification also have gene rearrangements, some encoding truncated, constitutively active mutants; by far the most common of these is known as variant III (vIII) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The A chain of the PDGF ligand along with its cognate alpha receptor is expressed in the vast majority of diffuse astrocytic tumors; this is therefore viewed as an early change in astrocytoma tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

High-grade gliomas are highly vascular tumors, and the histologic presence of microvascular proliferation indicates that the tumor is of high grade.

The most clearly implicated is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen that is expressed most often adjacent to areas of necrosis but not in grade II astrocytomas. This suggests that the malignant progression from low-grade astrocytoma to glioblastoma includes an &quot;angiogenic switch.&quot;</p><p>VEGF receptors are expressed by tumor endothelial cells, setting up a paracrine loop in which the tumor cells encourage vascular proliferation. The microenvironment is thus of importance in glioblastoma, with regions of neovascularization often surrounding zones of necrosis.
