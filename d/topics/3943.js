There are 12 groups of identified mushroom toxins with 14 described clinical syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77875 \">table 1</a>). Defining which clinical syndrome predominates, initiating general supportive care, and administering any specific treatments for that syndrome are the key steps in the recognition and management of mushroom poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The clinical manifestations of mushroom poisoning syndromes and the diagnostic evaluation of patients with mushroom poisoning are reviewed here. The general management of mushroom poisoning, and the diagnosis and treatment of poisoning caused by potentially lethal amatoxin-containing mushrooms (eg, <em>Amanita phalloides</em>) or by <em>Amanita smithiana</em> are discussed in detail separately.

In the United States, approximately 6000 mushroom exposures occur annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most of these patients experience no toxic effects or only mild or moderate symptoms. Over half of mushroom ingestions occur in children less than six years of age. In most cases, pediatric exposures are limited to a partial or single bite of nontoxic or minimally toxic mushrooms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76207 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68114\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68114 \">picture 2</a>). Even in the uncommon cases of amatoxin-containing mushroom exposures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73705 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52731\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52731 \">picture 4</a>), children typically do well due to the limited amount of toxins available in the small amount of mushroom usually ingested. In the United States, no pediatric fatalities due to ingestion of a single mushroom have been reported in over 25 years of National Poison Data System surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. </p><p>When serious toxicity or mortality due to mushroom ingestion does occur, it typically results from consumption of misidentified mushrooms by foraging adults and others who shared the meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. A common scenario involves amateur mushroom hunters or recent immigrants who mistake a toxic mushroom for an edible variety with similar morphologic features (eg, <em>Gyromitra esculenta</em> mistaken for <em>Morchella esculenta </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64502\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64502 \">picture 5</a>); Amanita species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73705 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52731\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52731 \">picture 4</a>) mistaken for Agaricus species) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p>In up to 95 percent of cases, the species of mushroom ingested is not identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, one must rely upon the presenting signs and symptoms to aid in the clinical diagnosis and to guide treatment recommendations.

Often these exposures occur when children take a bite of a &ldquo;little brown mushroom&rdquo; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76207 \">picture 1</a>) while playing outside in the backyard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. This category of toxicity accounts for most mushroom poisoning reported to regional poison centers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>Chlorophyllum molybdites</em> is one of the more common &ldquo;backyard mushrooms&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>With ingestion of these mushrooms, symptoms occur within 1 to 3 hours and include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping as well as diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Close attention to the history of ingestion and the timing associated with the onset of symptoms is important to differentiate acute gastroenteritis from the more concerning delayed gastroenteritis that may indicate consumption of a more lethal variety of mushroom toxins (eg, amatoxins, gyromitrin, orellanine). (See <a href=\"#H21619990\" class=\"local\">'Delayed gastroenteritis and liver toxicity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21619997\" class=\"local\">'Delayed gastroenteritis, seizures, and liver toxicity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21620032\" class=\"local\">'Delayed renal failure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21620046\" class=\"local\">'Delayed rhabdomyolysis'</a> below.)</p><p>An exception to this general rule applies to the Northwest United States, where patients who consume <em>Amanita smithiana</em> may develop acute gastroenteritis within 2 hours of ingestion, which is then followed by renal failure approximately 24 hours later.

Specific mushroom species that contain psilocybin and psilocin include <em>Psilocybe</em>, <em>Conocybe</em>, <em>Gymnopilus</em>, and <em>Panaeolus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These mushrooms grow throughout the United States and Europe, especially in warm, moist climates and are commonly abused for recreational purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Psilocybin and psilocin are stable alkaloids which are chemically related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and serotonin but are present in small amounts in both dried and fresh mushrooms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hallucinatory effects require the ingestion of several caps of fresh mushrooms (eg, 3 to 60 caps) and up to 2 g of dried mushrooms. </p><p>Feelings of euphoria and subsequent sensory distortion develop within 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingesting these mushrooms and are commonly associated with mild tachycardia and dilated pupils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Frank hallucinations may also occur. The duration of symptoms is typically 4 to 12 hours after mushroom consumption. Treatment is supportive. Benzodiazepines may be necessary for anxiety or panic provoked by the psychoactive effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mushroom-poisoning#H1129426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mushroom poisoning&quot;, section on 'Agitation, delirium, and/or hallucinations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21621879\"><span class=\"h3\">CNS excitation and depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This syndrome is caused by muscimol and ibotenic acid which are concentrated in the caps of <em>Amanita muscaria</em>, <em>Amanita pantherina</em>, and other related mushroom species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61933\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61933 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. <em>A. muscaria</em> mushrooms are the prototypic large red or orange capped mushroom with white plaques or spots. These mushrooms are also known as fly agaric mushrooms because of their ability to attract and kill flies that land on them. <em>A. muscaria</em> and <em>A. pantherina</em> species have been used for thousands of years because of their psychoactive effects, and cases of poisoning still occur in individuals who ingest them for their hallucinatory effects. The toxins ibotenic acid and muscimol are water-soluble. Peeling the skin of the cap, parboiling the mushrooms, and discarding the water may detoxify the mushrooms prior to consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Ibotenic acid and muscimol have very similar chemical structures, but opposite clinical effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Muscimol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant with structural similarities to gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). In contrast, ibotenic acid has excitatory effects at glutamic acid receptors in the CNS. Mushrooms in this class (including <em>A. muscaria</em>) do not contain sufficient muscarine to cause cholinergic effects. (See <a href=\"#H21622033\" class=\"local\">'Cholinergic poisoning'</a> below.) </p><p>Clinical findings typically occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours of ingestion and include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somnolence, coma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hallucinations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphoria </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bizarre behavior</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures (primarily in children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping</p><p/><p>Treatment of poisonings in this mushroom group is supportive and should include prompt management of delirium, agitation, or seizures and hydration in a monitored setting.

Among these, the species Inocybe and Clitocybe are frequently the source of poisoning. They commonly grow on lawns and in parks. </p><p>Some species of Amanita, including <em>Amanita muscaria</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61933\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61933 \">picture 6</a>), do contain very small amounts of muscarine, but not enough to cause cholinergic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H21621879\" class=\"local\">'CNS excitation and depression'</a> above.)</p><p>Muscarine is structurally similar to acetylcholine and causes toxicity by binding to postganglionic cholinergic neurons in the autonomic nervous system. Muscarine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. </p><p>Clinical effects usually begin within 30 minutes after ingestion. Patients develop bradycardia, diaphoresis, salivation, lacrimation, bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, and incontinence. Unlike other cholinergic poisoning (eg, pesticide cholinesterase inhibitors), muscarine toxicity is not typically life-threatening and is usually short-lived unless large amounts of mushrooms were consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, death due to refractory bradycardia and shock occurring 10 hours after mushroom consumption in an adult has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Treatment of muscarine poisoning consists of administration of anticholinergic agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a>) and intravenous fluids to manage dehydration.

This effect causes a marked elevation of blood aldehyde when ethanol is ingested several hours to seven days after <em>Coprinus</em> mushroom consumption.

Gyromitrin is present in many mushrooms of the Gyromitra genus, with <em>Gyromitra esculenta</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64502\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64502 \">picture 5</a>) being one of the most commonly ingested species. These mushrooms grow in North America, Europe, and Asia. Paxina species, <em>Sarcosphaera coronaria</em>, and <em>Cyathipodia micropus</em> also contain gyromitrin, but are less commonly encountered. </p><p>Toxicity of the gyromitrin-containing mushrooms varies by geographic location. Toxicity from gyromitrin-containing mushrooms can be differentiated from toxicity due to hepatotoxic Amanita species based on seasonal considerations: Gyromitra mushrooms grow in the spring and early summer, whereas Amanita species grow in the fall. The appearance of the mushrooms can also be used to differentiate the two species. Gyromitra are described as having a &ldquo;brain-like&rdquo; appearance whereas Amanita are typically &ldquo;umbrella-shaped&rdquo; and have gills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Most commonly, <em>Gyromitra esculenta</em> (false morel) is mistaken for the similar appearing <em>Morchella esculenta</em> (morel). Although certain methods of preparation may limit the toxicity of gyromitrin-containing mushrooms (eg, parboiling), it is still recommended that all members of this family be avoided. </p><p>Gyromitrin is hydrolyzed by liver alcohol dehydrogenase into acetaldehyde and monomethyl hydrazine, a substance similar to the hydrazines in rocket fuel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The mechanism of toxicity is inhibition of pyridoxal phosphate-related enzymatic reactions, which causes functional pyridoxine deficiency and ultimately leads to a depletion of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Thus, delayed seizures intractable to anticonvulsant therapy may result. </p><p>Clinical manifestations of gyromitrin toxicity include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed gastroenteritis (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea) typically beginning 6 to 10 hours after ingestion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches, weakness, and muscle cramping </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed seizures </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed hepatoxicity, including liver failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolysis (uncommon)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methemoglobinemia (uncommon) </p><p/><p>Most patients return to baseline health within a couple of days.

Whole mushrooms are preferred, but identification can be made on parts of the mushroom, especially the cap. Storage is facilitated by wrapping the mushrooms in wax paper, placing it in a paper bag, and refrigerating the sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Storage in plastic bags should be avoided. Digital photographs of whole mushrooms can be immediately sent to a mycologist for inspection.

Analysis for specific mycotoxins is difficult and not usually feasible in a time-frame that is of clinical utility.

The clinician should contact a poison control center (United States regional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 or access the World Health Organization's list of international poison centers [<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16135\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>]) to discuss appropriate testing methods, type of specimen needed, specimen handling, laboratories where testing is available, and interpretation of results.

Amatoxin is rapidly cleared from the blood; urine is the matrix of choice for testing for amatoxins. ELISA assays should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical assessment. False positives have been reported with ingestion of mushroom species that do not contain amatoxins. ELISA may be of particular use in ruling out potential exposures to amatoxin-containing mushrooms in patients who present after mixed-mushroom exposures and have early onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. ELISA assays are most useful if samples are tested early in patient presentation.

In most situations, the ill patient will provide a food history that implicates the typical source of food poisoning (eg, undercooked meat, eggs, rice, salads, home-canned vegetables), and mushrooms are found not to have been consumed.

When differentiating mushroom poisoning from food poisoning in these situations, the clinician should monitor for specific findings that point to the underlying etiology (eg, descending paralysis [botulism], hemolytic uremic syndrome [enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em>], liver toxicity [amatoxin mushroom poisoning]) and provide comprehensive supportive care. When botulism is suspected, administration of antitoxin may also be indicated.
