It usually starts and stops suddenly, without warning. SVT is also called &quot;paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia&quot; or PSVT. (Paroxysmal means a sudden attack.)</p><p>SVT happens because of a problem with the heart's electrical system. It starts in the upper chambers of the heart, called the &quot;atria&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56936\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56936 \">figure 1</a>). The fast heartbeat can last from a few minutes to hours, but usually lasts for 10 to 15 minutes. It often happens when you are at rest. But in some people, exercise triggers it.</p><p>The 3 main types of SVT are called:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial tachycardia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101255851\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of SVT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might not have symptoms. But you might feel that your heart is beating too fast, beating hard, or seems to skip a beat. These kinds of heartbeat changes are called &quot;palpitations.&quot;</p><p>You might also feel:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lightheaded</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very tired</p><p/><p>If you also have coronary heart disease, you might also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel a tightness in your chest</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101255866\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>If you do not have these problems, but you often feel your heart beating fast or irregularly, talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101255881\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for supraventricular tachycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do a test called an electrocardiogram, also known as an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG.&quot; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Other possible tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holter monitor &ndash; This is a small, portable machine you wear that records all the heart's electrical activity over 1 or 2 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76605 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Event or loop monitor &ndash; These are similar to Holter monitors but smaller, because they don't record all the time. Instead, you start the monitor when you feel symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75670 \">figure 4</a>). Your doctor will likely have you wear this type of monitor every day for about a month.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101255896\"><span class=\"h1\">How is supraventricular tachycardia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the cause of the tachycardia. When your heartbeat is very fast, your doctor might suggest ways to slow it down. He or she might have you cough, or bear down as if you're having a bowel movement. Doing these things can affect the nerve that helps control your heartbeat.</p><p>Other treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control the speed or rhythm of your heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment called &quot;cardioversion&quot; that involves applying a mild electrical current to the heart to fix its rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments called &quot;ablation.&quot; Ablation treatments use heat (called &quot;radiofrequency ablation&quot;) or cold (called &quot;cryoablation&quot;) to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending the abnormal electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101255911\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tachycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers-and-their-responses-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vagal maneuvers and their responses (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
