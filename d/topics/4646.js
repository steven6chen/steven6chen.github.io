It typically occurs in children six months to three years of age and most commonly is caused by parainfluenza virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of croup has changed significantly since the 1980s. Glucocorticoids and nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> have become the cornerstones of therapy. Substantial clinical evidence supports the efficacy of these interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The impact also is evident in the decrease in annual hospital admissions for croup in children in the United States between 1979 to 1982 and 1994 to 1997 (from 2.8 to 2.1 per 1000 for children &lt;1 year and from 1.8 to 1.2 per 1000 children for children 1 to 4 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Treatment of croup may involve a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. It may occur entirely at home, or in the office, emergency department, or hospital setting. Supportive and pharmacologic interventions will be discussed below. The clinical features and evaluation of croup and the approach to management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-approach-to-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Approach to management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOCORTICOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids provide long-lasting and effective treatment of mild, moderate, and severe croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/3,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-9</a>]. The anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to decrease edema in the laryngeal mucosa of children with croup.

Few serious adverse effects have been reported in the studies evaluating the efficacy of a <strong>single</strong> dose of glucocorticoids in croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, most of these studies were too small to sufficiently evaluate rare (&lt;1 percent) adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The primary concern is potential risk of progressive viral infection or secondary bacterial infection, which have been reported in patients who received glucocorticoid treatment over several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], or received nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> and had neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Based on the available evidence, there do not appear to be clinically significant differences in croup outcomes between IM and orally administered dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The optimal dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> in children with croup is uncertain. In clinical trials, doses ranging from 0.15 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> have been shown to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The maximum dose of dexamethasone used in these trials ranged from 10 mg to 20 mg, with most using 16 mg. For children with moderate to severe croup (ie, Westley croup score of &ge;3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100744 \">table 1</a>)), we suggest a single dose of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum 16 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Dexamethasone at this dose has proven efficacy in croup as demonstrated in numerous clinical trials, including several high-quality placebo-controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/4,7,9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,9,23</a>]. Based on these data, we also suggest a dose of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum 16mg) for children with mild croup (ie, Westley croup score of &le;2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100744 \">table 1</a>)); however, limited data suggest that lower doses (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> may be equally effective in patients with mild croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/7,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24-27</a>]. Nonpharmacologic management is another reasonable alternative for patients with mild croup.

The advantage of prednisolone is that it is more palatable than the oral liquid preparation of dexamethasone and may be easier for young children to take. Limited evidence suggests prednisolone is effective in improving croup symptoms; however, there may be an increased risk of symptom recurrence with prednisolone compared with dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> in the treatment of croup has been evaluated in several small clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/8,26,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,31,32</a>].

A greater proportion of children treated with prednisolone required additional health care visits (7 versus 2 percent); however, the difference was not statistically significant.

However, it has equivalent potency to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> and, in theory, should have similar effects. Despite its lack of proven benefit, prednisone is widely used in the outpatient management of croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> is to be used, it is important to administer a dose that is equivalent in strength to the doses of glucocorticoids that have been better studied. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Dexamethasone</a> has 6.67 times the glucocorticoid potency of prednisone (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of prednisone = 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of dexamethasone; 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of prednisone = 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of dexamethasone; and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of prednisone = 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of dexamethasone). If choosing to use the higher dose (ie, 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of prednisone), the volume required may be prohibitive given that the concentration of the oral solution of prednisone is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/1</span> mL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Betamethasone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pilot study compared the effectiveness of a single oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> (0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> with a single dose of IM <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> in 52 children (six months to six years) with mild to moderate croup who were treated in the ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In one trial, treatment with intramuscular (IM) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> and nebulized epinephrine was associated with decreased duration of hospitalization compared with IM dexamethasone and placebo (-32 hours, 95% CI -59.1 to -4.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> does not alter the natural history of croup in the short (&gt;2 hours) or longer term (24 to 36 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/1,37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37,40</a>].</p><p>In the studies described above, racemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> was administered either by nebulization alone or by nebulization combined with intermittent positive pressure breaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/1,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36,37</a>].

However, a randomized double-blind study comparing racemic epinephrine and L-epinephrine in children with croup found no difference between the two preparations in 30-minute croup score, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, fraction of inspired oxygen, or oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This finding is particularly important outside of the United States, where racemic epinephrine is not readily available.

Children who require repeated frequent dosing (eg, three or more doses within two to three hours) to achieve stabilization of their respiratory function generally should be admitted to an ICU or intermediate care setting (depending on the severity of persisting signs).</p><p>There also does not appear to be any advantage of administering nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> by use of intermittent positive pressure breathing versus simple nebulization alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical effects of nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> last for no more than two hours. After the effects have worn off, symptoms may return to baseline (an apparent worsening, sometimes referred to as the &quot;rebound phenomenon&quot;). Children who receive even a single dose of nebulized epinephrine should be observed in the ED or hospital setting for at least three to four hours after administration to ensure that symptoms do not return to baseline.</p><p>Serious adverse effects from nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> are exceedingly rare. However, a case of myocardial infarction in a child with croup who received three doses of racemic epinephrine within 60 minutes has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thus, it seems prudent to place children who require ongoing epinephrine treatments more frequently than every one to two hours on cardiac monitors (both because of the severity of illness and the potential systemic impact of nebulized epinephrine). Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring (or equivalent cardiac monitoring) also should be considered in these cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">OXYGEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen is not known to have any direct impact on the subglottic edema or airway narrowing, but should be administered to children who are hypoxemic (oxygen saturation of &lt;92 percent in room air) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in moderate to severe respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. Supplemental oxygen should be humidified to decrease drying effects on the airways, since drying may impede the physiologic removal of airway secretions via mucociliary and cough mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Heliox</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Helium is inert, nontoxic, and of very low density. Heliox is a mixture of helium (70 to 80 percent) and oxygen (20 to 30 percent). It can flow through airways with less turbulence and resistance than pure oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-clinical-use-of-heliox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and clinical use of heliox&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Heliox decreases the work of respiration in children with croup and theoretically could be used as a temporizing measure, to prevent the need for intubation while waiting for glucocorticoids to decrease airway edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, in clinical trials, heliox has not definitively been shown to be more effective than humidified oxygen or racemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> in reducing croup scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. A 2013 systematic review found only three methodologically limited trials (91 patients) evaluating heliox in children with croup and concluded that a larger trial is needed before recommendations regarding the use of heliox in children with croup can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">MIST THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humidified air is frequently used in the treatment of croup, although there have been no studies supporting its efficacy in reducing symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Two randomized trials (one comparing mist versus no mist and the other comparing no mist, low humidity, and 100 percent humidity) among children brought to an emergency department for croup demonstrated no significant change in croup scores from baseline between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Although humidified air does not reduce subglottic edema, it may provide other benefits.

In addition, a mist source may provide a sense of comfort and reassurance to both the child and family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. In medical settings, mist therapy may be provided by blow-by or saline nebulization treatments. Croup tents should be avoided, since they can aggravate a child's anxiety and make vital signs and other visual assessments of the child more difficult. Some guidelines recommend against the use of mist therapy for children who are hospitalized with croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].
