Regurgitation associated with prosthetic heart valves includes regurgitation through the valve (transvalvular) as well as paravalvular regurgitation (also known as paravalvular leak[PVL]). Symptomatic severe prosthetic valve regurgitation is an uncommon complication of surgical valve replacement. However, it is associated with poor outcomes with both conservative management and surgical treatment. </p><p>This topic will discuss the prognosis and management of prosthetic valve regurgitation.

When prosthetic valve regurgitation is due to mechanical or biologic prosthetic valve thrombosis, treatment of valve thrombosis usually corrects the regurgitation.

However, the prosthetic valve regurgitation does not generally resolve and may progress while the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics. Surgical consultation is recommended to evaluate and monitor for the presence of an indication for surgical intervention.

The objective of medical treatment is to relieve congestion and reduce afterload, which is achieved with the use of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. If systolic ventricular dysfunction appears, standard therapy for HF with reduced ejection fraction should be administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Supportive medical therapy is indicated in patients with hemolysis. If clinically significant hemolysis is present, iron and folate supplementation is indicated to correct deficiencies in these nutrients. Erythropoietin injection or programmed blood transfusions may be required to treat symptomatic anemia. If hemolysis is intractable, surgical or transcatheter therapy (ie, device closure for paravalvular leak [PVL]; transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR] for transvalvular regurgitation, although the last rarely causes hemolysis) is indicated as discussed below.

Data are lacking on the natural history of symptomatic prosthetic transvalvular regurgitation and the effect of treatment. However, indirect data are available from observational studies of patients with symptomatic severe native valve disease showing high mortality risk for patients treated medically, lack of efficacy of medical therapy, and association between surgical treatment and improved symptoms and reduced mortality rates. As an example, an observational study found a mortality rate of 6 percent per year in patients with severe native aortic regurgitation (AR) with class II symptoms and a mortality rate of nearly 24.6 percent per year for patients with severe native AR with class III or IV symptoms treated medically (without surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among patients with severe AR, aortic valve surgery was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality.

In an observational study of 96 patients with mitral PVL with mean follow-up of five years, the mortality rate at follow-up was 12 percent among patients treated with valve reoperation compared with 26 percent for patients treated conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, there were significant improvements in mean hematocrit levels and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> symptoms after surgery. </p><p>However, surgical management of prosthetic regurgitation is limited by the high risk of the procedure, with survival varying from 40 to 50 percent at 10 years and operative mortality rates around 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of 155 patients undergoing redo aortic valve surgery, operative mortality was 4.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

However, some studies have found that a nonurgent redo procedure in patients with NYHA functional class <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> symptoms and absence of active endocarditis has the same surgical risk as a first valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>It is not clearly known whether surgical risks and outcomes differ with PVLs versus transvalvular regurgitation, but observational data suggest that PVLs results tend to be worse, with less complete surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>].

An observational study compared 40 patients who underwent minimally invasive mitral valve replacement surgery with 21 patients who underwent a transapical mitral VIV procedure. The two-year survival rates were 86 versus 87 percent in patients undergoing redo mitral valve replacement compared with those undergoing VIV implantation without significant differences in safety end points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623965373\"><span class=\"h4\">On transcatheter closure of paravalvular leaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transcatheter closure has developed as a less invasive solution to treat PVLs. A variety of devices are used off label to close PVLs since there are no devices specifically designed and approved for this purpose, and procedures are often long and technically demanding. General anesthesia is also required, with proper anticoagulation, especially if transseptal puncture is performed. Percutaneous closure is often assisted by fluoroscopy in combination with transesophageal echocardiography, and sometimes intracardiac echocardiography is also required to locate anterior PVLs. Also, computed tomography transesophageal echocardiography fusion images can provide intraprocedural guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Percutaneous closure of PVL can be approached from various options: transapical, transaortic, or transseptal. Most aortic PVLs can be successfully handled from retrograde transaortic approach, while mitral PVLs are technically more challenging, with the transapical approach providing the most versatile access.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis included 12 studies with a total of 362 patients with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves who underwent transcatheter reduction of PVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; the three largest studies contributed more than half of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical success (defined as successful delivery of the device) occurred in 82.3 percent of mitral procedures and 86.9 percent of aortic procedures.

Major adverse cardiac events at 30 days occurred in 8.7 percent. </p><p>Limited data are available to directly compare outcomes with surgical and transcatheter PVL closure. Early data suggest noninferiority of PVL percutaneous closure versus surgical correction and superiority to conservative management. A single-center observational study included 122 patients who underwent surgical treatment for PVL (surgical repair or redo surgical prosthetic valve replacement if repair was judged unfeasible by the surgeon) and 17 patients who underwent transcatheter closure (via a surgical transapical approach) described a higher in-hospital mortality rate for surgical patients (9.3 versus 0 percent) and surgical treatment was a borderline significant risk factor for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio: 8, 95% CI 1.8 to 13; p = 0.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].
