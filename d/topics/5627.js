It is the most frequent form of intellectual disability (mental retardation) caused by a microscopically demonstrable chromosomal aberration. DS is characterized by a variety of dysmorphic features, congenital malformations, and other health problems and medical conditions. Not all of them are present in each affected individual. The impact of DS for each person is individual, with some individuals being profoundly impacted while others are healthy and able to live independently as adults. In general, individuals with DS are now reaching fuller potentials secondary to better educational programs, medical advancements, community resources, and the support of family and friends.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of DS will be presented here. The epidemiology, genetics, and management are discussed separately.

Most are mildly to moderately intellectually disabled, with an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the 50 to 70 or 35 to 50 range, respectively, although some are severely impaired with an IQ of 20 to 35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Developmental impairment becomes apparent in the first year of life. In general, the average age of sitting (11 months), creeping (17 months), and walking (26 months) is approximately twice the typical age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The child with DS continues to learn new skills. However, IQ declines through the first 10 years of age, reaching a plateau in adolescence that continues into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>].

The most common profile, in which language comprehension is equal to mental age and language production is more delayed, occurs in two-thirds of affected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one-third, language comprehension, mental age, and language production are equal. Impairment in expressive language was noted in another study of children with DS, who had fewer different and total words and decreased mean length of utterance compared with controls matched for nonverbal mental age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Vocabulary skills accelerated more rapidly than syntax (average sentence length and structure) and surpassed mental age in adolescence.

The diagnosis is often delayed compared with children without DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some children with DS present in the school-aged years with new-onset or worsening autistic-like features, cognitive decline to the point of dementia, and new-onset insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The term &quot;Down syndrome disintegrative disorder&quot; has been suggested to describe this cluster of clinical findings, although it is not clear if this is one disorder or several different ones with similar presentations. The etiology is not known, but autoimmunity is suspected. There are no established diagnosis or treatment recommendations for this clinical association. Some patients respond to psychiatric care. Further research is needed in this area.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;, section on 'Atlantoaxial instability'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with symptomatic spinal cord compression may have neck pain, torticollis, gait abnormalities, loss of bowel or bladder control, or signs of quadriparesis or quadriplegia and require immediate stabilization. Asymptomatic individuals appear to remain asymptomatic whether or not physical activity is restricted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,121</a>]. In one study, DS children with AAI were randomly assigned to participate or not in athletic activities considered to be risky and evaluated after one year. The groups were similar in motor function, frequency of neurologic signs, and changes in atlantoaxial distance and were also similar to children with DS and without AAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DS arthropathy has a prevalence of 8 to 10 per 1000, or approximately six times the prevalence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

Diagnosis should be confirmed with a genetic test (eg, a karyotype performed on a blood sample). Alternative methods (eg, interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] for trisomy 21 or quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction [QF-PCR]) may be used to expedite diagnosis, but these investigations should always be followed by a full karyotype in order to detect DS due to translocations (eg, Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 21) or mosaic DS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3150003864\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Ten of the characteristic dysmorphic features are common in newborns with DS and are usually recognized soon after birth. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Dysmorphic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all individuals with DS have cognitive impairment, although the range is wide. Most are mildly to moderately intellectually disabled, although some are severely impaired. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders are more common in DS than typical children but less common than in those with other causes of mental retardation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Intellectual disability (mental retardation)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-half of individuals with DS have congenital heart disease. Septal defects are the most common. Some asymptomatic adolescents and adults without structural heart disease develop valve abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with trisomy 21 are at increased risk for gastrointestinal tract anomalies, including duodenal atresia or stenosis, imperforate anus, and esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula. They are also at increased risk for celiac disease and Hirschsprung disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth weight, length, and head circumference are less in DS compared with typical infants. The growth rate for height is reduced in DS compared with typical children. In general, weight is less than expected for length in infants with DS and then increases disproportionally so that the majority of children are obese by age three to four years. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmologic disorders are common in patients with DS and increase in frequency with age. These disorders include refractive errors, strabismus, nystagmus, cataracts, and keratoconus. Hearing loss is also common, and otitis media is a frequent problem. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Eye problems'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hearing loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine abnormalities in DS include thyroid dysfunction and type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H2688495\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic abnormalities affecting red cells, white cells, and platelets are common in DS and include polycythemia, macrocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytosis, and leukemia (transient, acute megakaryoblastic, and acute lymphoblastic). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with DS are fertile and may become pregnant. However, nearly all males with DS are infertile. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Reproduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased rates of urologic abnormalities, arthropathy, pulmonary disease, and benign skin disorders are also seen in patients with DS. (See <a href=\"#H12592131\" class=\"local\">'Urologic abnormalities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Arthropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5936278\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2688998\" class=\"local\">'Skin disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with DS are at increased risk of atlantoaxial instability (AAI), defined as excessive mobility of the articulation of the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2), although spinal cord compression due to subluxation of the cervical spine is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Atlantoaxial instability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DS is associated with a variety of immunologic impairments that are thought to be related to the increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies. However, these defects are inconsistently demonstrated. Whether these represent a primary immunodeficiency or early senescence of the immune system is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H2689257\" class=\"local\">'Immunodeficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of DS is often made by prenatal screening.
