Based upon observational, population-based studies that have counted cases of MCA reported to child protection agencies, the estimated annual incidence is approximately 0.4 to 1.2 per 100,000 in children younger than 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Other features associated with MCA in these studies include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother is usually the perpetrator.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child is most commonly younger than five years of age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True medical illness or disability is present in the child in many cases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complexity of the medical presentation is notable; in one study, almost 75 percent of the children had multiple symptoms reported by the caregiver.</p><p/><p>However, these estimates do not account for less severe cases of MCA that are <strong>not</strong> reported to child protection authorities and thus, likely reflect a significant underestimate of how frequently MCA occurs. Our experience suggests that most physicians who care for children on a regular basis encounter the milder forms of MCA commonly during the course of their practice. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255070\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2019805650\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no typical clinical presentation for medical child abuse (MCA). Because the history gathered from a caretaker is the starting point for medical care, symptom constellations that depend upon caregiver report (eg, gastrointestinal complaints such as vomiting or diarrhea; neurologic symptoms such as coma, ataxia, seizures, or apnea; or allergic responses) may occur more commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Almost every disease category has been implicated in cases of MCA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59264\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59264 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/2,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14-19</a>]. Efforts to characterize the types of illnesses exhibited by victims of MCA have resulted in several series of similar presentations including children who present with pseudo-seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], pseudo-obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], polymicrobial sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H268356547\" class=\"local\">'Spectrum of illness'</a> below.)</p><p>However, published reports of MCA reflect some of the most complex and extreme cases and do not adequately reflect the full spectrum of illness, especially the milder forms of MCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>General features that can occur in children with MCA include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reported history varies from what is observed (eg, descriptions of severe illness in the presence of a normal appearing child) or does not make sense.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histories may vary significantly by different observers and suggest that the perpetrator's history is distorted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The illness is often recurrent, unexplained, unusual, or prolonged and does not respond to treatment as expected. If the child has a specific diagnosis, it may be extremely rare. However, a significant portion of victims of MCA also have a chronic illness or disability.

Characteristics such as having extensive medical knowledge, exhibiting calm during otherwise stressful medical events, being a medical provider, and becoming angry at medical providers who do not agree with them, have all found their way into profile descriptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. It is now widely accepted that such descriptions, while potentially helpful in raising one's suspicion about the possibility of MCA, have little predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. The physician should remain focused on the experience of the child rather than the personality of the perpetrator.</p><p>The clinician should <strong>not</strong> use motivation as a factor when determining if MCA has occurred, requires child abuse reporting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> warrants child abuse specialty involvement. Although early writings purported to find a common motivation for perpetrators of MCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], there has been no clear demonstration that a consistent motivation exists in a majority of caregivers. Our experience and systematic reviews of case series and reports indicate that perpetrators offer many different motivations for their actions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Though inferring motivation in others is difficult, it is not necessary to know a caretaker's motivation to determine if a child has experienced harm, or to decide the harm should be stopped. (See <a href=\"#H3083464728\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H253407225\" class=\"local\">'Indications for consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team'</a> below.)</p><p>Caretakers have also been known to present their children for medical care in an attempt to get medicine that they take themselves, or to generate concern in the community that can translate into raising money for the use of the family. In these cases the behavior is fraudulent in addition to MCA and some individuals have been prosecuted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

A one-time episode of vomiting can be reported as, &quot;My child was vomiting all night and hasn't urinated today.&quot; Exaggeration of symptoms is common and can usually be perceived as an attempt by the parent to make sure that her concern is truly appreciated by medical providers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, persistent and convincing exaggeration can result in significant unnecessary medical care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fabrication</strong> &ndash; A more serious parental action is fabrication or making up symptoms that have not occurred. Reported types of illness fabrication include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intentionally altering medical records or providing a false past medical or family history.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reporting symptoms that have not occurred (eg, seizures, apnea, or syncope).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simulation of symptoms (eg, addition of blood to urine or stool samples to simulate hematuria or hematochezia, warming a thermometer to simulate fever).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Illness inducement</strong> &ndash; With exaggeration and fabrication, the caretaker does not personally harm the patient. She merely creates an environment in which medical care based on her actions can be harmful.

It is typically recognized after the fact when a provider reconsiders whether the care given would have, indeed, been chosen if more accurate information had been available on which to base the treatment decisions.

All professionals caring for the child should be educated regarding MCA, danger signs, and the need to protect the child. The primary concern must be the health and safety of the child and his or her siblings.

Medical providers performing documentation should be clear about whether any clinical manifestations of disease were reported by the caretaker only and not directly observed.

These interviews should be conducted individually. The condition of the child when outside the care of the suspected perpetrator should also be documented if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/28,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,39</a>]. Any available reported witnesses to the child's illness (eg, babysitters, relatives, teachers, physicians, and nurses who have previously treated the child) should also be interviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/17,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The family's medical history should be reviewed, including neutral sources (not just the statements of the immediate family members), with attention to any unusual illnesses or deaths in the siblings or parents.

Blood, urine, and stool samples, potentially contaminated intravenous fluids or lines, and other materials should be retained for future analysis, with care taken to establish a chain of evidence for law enforcement purposes (this includes proper sealing, labeling, and storing of specimens to ensure that specimen tampering cannot occur) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/17,31,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Analysis of these materials can include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Drug assays</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Toxicology testing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Blood group typing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Testing of stools for phenolphthalein or other laxatives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Analysis of blood, urine, intravenous fluid, or milk for added substances</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Because false positive and negative results may occur, especially with toxicologic testing, involvement of a clinical laboratory or medical toxicology specialist may be warranted to ensure that the proper testing is ordered and correctly interpreted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Video surveillance</strong> &ndash; Video surveillance requires extensive preparation of staff and a process that ensures protection of the child and legal protection for the participants. Thus, it should only be performed in conjunction with a multidisciplinary child abuse team and requires involvement of hospital and other personnel not typically directly involved in clinical care (eg, security, hospital administration, legal counsel, and regional child protection services).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Video surveillance sometimes reveals deliberate harmful actions by the parent (suffocation or administration of medications or contaminants). Video surveillance in cases of suspected induction of illness in a child is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/2,40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40-45</a>].

Others argue that the need to protect the child overrides these concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/40,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45</a>]. Most hospitals inform patients that video surveillance is used in the hospital in material the patients' parents sign on admission. Many interpret this as having permission to use covert video.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Proponents of surveillance argue that without it, cases of fabricated or induced illness will go undetected due to the reluctance of physicians to make the diagnosis, the tendency of patients to switch physicians once the diagnosis is suspected, and the difficulty in proving inducement or fabrication of illness without monitoring. The use of video surveillance can either support or exclude abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As an example, one study reviewed the use of covert video surveillance in the evaluation of 41 cases of suspected feigned or induced illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Suspicions were confirmed in 23 cases. Video surveillance was required to make the diagnosis in 13 cases (56 percent), was supportive of the diagnosis in five cases, and ruled out the diagnosis in four cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">It is important to remember that videotaping in the hospital and not &quot;catching&quot; a caretaker abusing a child does not rule out that abuse has taken place in the past.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Initiation of covert video surveillance should be preceded by the following steps:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Assessment of the case by a multidisciplinary team, including representatives of the medical and nursing staff, social services, hospital risk management, and security services, with the conclusion that either fabricated or induced illness is likely and surveillance is necessary to protect the child, or it is unlikely but no other explanation of the child's symptoms can be determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Local child protection services should be notified that monitoring is taking place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>All personnel involved in patient care must maintain strict confidentiality about the occurrence of the video monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The video feed should be monitored continuously by security officers or other personnel who have been trained in the manifestations of fabricated or induced illness in a child and the monitoring of caretakers for unusual or dangerous actions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>All healthcare workers on the floor should be aware of the monitoring. When notified by the security officer of an unusual or dangerous action on the part of the caretaker, medical providers should be ready to enter the room immediately, assess the situation, and intervene if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring social media</strong> &ndash; Social media makes it possible for persons with similar beliefs to find each other easily. The provision of anonymity also allows people to make claims that can never be substantiated. Social media is also often public. There is a growing awareness that parents who get unneeded medical care for their children often find an audience on social media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. They post pictures of their &quot;sick&quot; children, write blogs about their medical experiences, and complain about physicians who do not agree with them. They also raise money for purposes having to do with claiming their child needs expensive care for a nonexistent illness. A quick survey of social media sites can be very helpful in providing information confirming suspicions of MCA.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H645165859\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical child abuse (MCA) may require differentiation from an undiagnosed medical condition and other forms of child abuse. However, both medical disease and other forms of child abuse may also be present in a child with MCA. In our sample, 74 percent of children with MCA also had a diagnosable medical condition but received medical care not justified by the severity of the underlying illness. In the rest of the group, no underlying medical illness could be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a separate case series, up to 30 percent of children suffering from moderate to severe MCA have an underlying verified medical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similarly, comorbid abusive conditions have also been described including failure to thrive, intentional injury, inappropriate administration of medications, and child neglect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>In most cases of mild MCA, determining that a medical condition is not present is relatively straightforward because the child appears well. In these patients, the physician needs to maintain a stance of reassurance and not give in to parent requests for unnecessary testing or treatment solely based upon a history that differs from the normal physical examination and appropriate ancillary testing. The physician should also investigate whether the exaggerations and frequent requests for care are amenable to simple reassurance or require more direct mental health intervention for the caregiver. (See <a href=\"#H90255160\" class=\"local\">'Mild'</a> below.)</p><p>However, for patients with moderate or severe MCA, the physician needs to be careful not to be drawn into an extensive search for an illness that does not exist while ensuring that true pathology is not missed. To achieve the proper balance frequently requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a child abuse team led by a child abuse specialist, relevant medical or surgical subspecialists, and mental health professionals. Hospitalization may also be warranted. When excluding disease, noninvasive ancillary studies with low risk should be preferred and invasive testing or procedures avoided.</p><p>MCA differs from other forms of abuse in one important feature. The harm to the child comes from unnecessary and potentially harmful medical care. The medical care system has become the weapon with which the caretaker harms the child by the use of deception. However, regardless of what type of child abuse exists, the key intervention is to stop the abuse, involve a child abuse team whenever possible, and notify child protection when abuse is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H90255148\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253407225\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR CONSULTATION WITH A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CHILD ABUSE TEAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team and child abuse specialist is warranted in all situations where the physician suspects that the caregiver's inappropriate actions are resulting in significant disruption to the child's activities (moderate medical child abuse [MCA]) or are potentially life threatening (severe MCA). Confirmation of MCA is <strong>not</strong> required prior to consultation; a suspicion of MCA is sufficient. Furthermore, given the challenges and special circumstances surrounding the diagnostic evaluation of children suffering from moderate or severe MCA, a multidisciplinary child abuse team should be involved prior to attempts at confirmation, whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H90255106\" class=\"local\">'Moderate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H90255118\" class=\"local\">'Severe'</a> above.)</p><p>Consultation is also encouraged when the physician is not sure whether the caregiver's behavior constitutes MCA and to support physician's efforts to address mild MCA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255148\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255160\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early identification of distorted historical information, hopefully before a child is harmed, is the best way to prevent the situation from expanding to moderate or severe medical child abuse (MCA). It is the doctor's responsibility to weigh the value of the information received and challenge information that is not supported by medical observation. Discussion of the case or consultation with a child abuse specialist is encouraged to assist the physician in identifying when mild MCA is present and to help guide intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1081572153\" class=\"local\">'Mild'</a> above.)</p><p>The physician should meet with all caregivers and relay the concern that the history does not match the patient's findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is often helpful to ask the caregiver why they are providing the inaccurate history. In many cases, the caregiver may disclose significant concern about the child's well-being, which often can be addressed by reassurance and serve to end or significantly modify their abnormal behavior or may identify stressors that are exacerbating or causing caregiver anxiety or depression. During the meeting, the physician should explicitly state that accurate information is needed going forward to provide proper pediatric care. It is helpful to require that further evaluation be based on a complete medical evaluation by the primary care provider and not be provided over the phone. A medical provider should make continued care in his or her practice an important condition of ongoing care.</p><p>This conversation serves to bring into the open the discrepancy in beliefs between the perpetrator and the physician and can have the effect of repairing the <span class=\"nowrap\">doctor/patient</span> relationship. In addition to education and reassurance, the physician can offer to make referrals for treatment of caregiver anxiety disorders or depression, if indicated, or activate the caretaker's social support network.</p><p>If, after the attempt to reconcile what constitutes appropriate care, the parent cannot accept the need for the limitation of medical care because the child is not ill, then the gulf between caretaker and doctor is more extreme than previously thought. In such circumstances, it is important to document the conversation and the concern regarding the caregiver's actions as well as ensuring notification of other members of the family, other providers in the practice and, when applicable, other sites where care has been frequently sought. </p><p>If the family decides to leave the practice, most physicians receiving a new patient will want to have records sent by the previous provider. It is important for the communication between that physician and the patient&rsquo;s family to be passed along to the new treatment environment. If a parent refuses to give permission for a transfer of records, this, in itself, becomes important information for the new treater. In the author&rsquo;s experience most parents sign requests for information routinely unless they have something serious to hide. </p><p>If the parent&rsquo;s continued presentations for care become detrimental to the well-being of the child (eg, frequent absences from school) or lead to unnecessary health care being provided, then moderate child abuse may be occurring and consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team and a report to child protection services is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H90255172\" class=\"local\">'Moderate and severe'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255172\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate and severe</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255208\"><span class=\"h3\">Stop the abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspicion or confirmation of moderate or severe MCA warrants notification of child protection services and, whenever possible, consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team led by a child abuse specialist. Transfer to a pediatric tertiary care center may be necessary to obtain the proper resources for the child.</p><p>Once moderate to severe MCA is identified, unnecessary medical care should be stopped. It is prudent to stop the most dangerous medical care first:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancel scheduled but unnecessary surgery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take out unnecessary vascular access (eg, peripheral or central venous catheters).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop the medications that can have the worst potential side effects such as cancer or seizure medications.</p><p/><p>Once the most dangerous treatments are discontinued, other medications and treatments can be taken away at an appropriate time.</p><p>Typically, there are multiple providers involved in the care of these children. A challenging but essential step is to get agreement from all providers on the diagnosis of MCA and the new course of treatment. A multispecialty case conference should be arranged so that each provider can re-examine the care initiated and justify the care with appropriate, objective evidence or agree that current care can be discontinued.</p><p>Unanimous agreement on the treatment plan going forward must occur; if even one provider does not agree, the parent will gravitate to that provider and efforts to prevent harm, including appropriate response from child protection services, will be significantly compromised.</p><p>A multidisciplinary child abuse team led by a child abuse specialist is needed to facilitate the process of getting this consensus on appropriate medical care from the healthcare providers. Child abuse specialists can also provide the necessary bridge between healthcare providers and governmental child protection agencies and guide proper mandated reporting that is required in cases of MCA. (See <a href=\"#H90255214\" class=\"local\">'Involve child protection agencies'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-social-and-medicolegal-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues&quot;, section on 'Reporting suspected abuse'</a>.)</p><p>Additional steps that must be taken promptly once physician consensus on the diagnosis of MCA and ongoing management is established include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Notification of</strong> <strong>child protection services</strong> &ndash; Coordination with child protection services in terms of timing of the informing session described below with their initiation of an investigation, possible removal of the child from the perpetrator's care, or legal action against the perpetrator is critical and can be facilitated by the child abuse team. Specific timing of these events varies according to the severity and type of MCA.

One to two written pages is sufficient. Parents, medical treatment personnel, and anyone helping to enforce the contract are asked to sign. The process of writing, reading, and signing the contract is a concrete demonstration that a new relationship exists between the medical care establishment and the family.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A signed contract can be distributed to all treating personnel, to emergency departments, and to other treating facilities.

(See <a href=\"#H90255238\" class=\"local\">'Legal intervention'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Measures must be in place to prevent the caregiver from fleeing with the child during or after the conference.

(See <a href=\"#H90255226\" class=\"local\">'Provide family support'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Rarely, in cases of induced disease, an assault has occurred and police notification with arrest of the perpetrator may preempt the informing session.

As part of this communication a child abuse report is required and should provide a clear description of what the parent did to get unnecessary care, the nature of that care, and its potential danger for the child. Whenever possible, before filing the report with the child protection agency, all other treatment providers should review and ensure its accuracy and completeness. However, there should not be undue delay in filing a child abuse report. In most jurisdictions, a verbal report is required as soon as possible after the abuse is discovered and a written report should follow within a short period of time (typically 24 hours). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-social-and-medicolegal-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues&quot;, section on 'Reporting suspected abuse'</a>.)</p><p>Making certain that the child can remain safe requires involvement of child protection services. Many times agency personnel will have little experience with MCA. There may be a need to educate an assigned worker about why the child needs protection. Calling it &quot;child abuse&quot; rather than emphasizing a possible mental illness in the caretaker will make it easier for the agency personnel to proceed. The primary physician may be called upon to explain the reasons for the report. If agency response does not appear adequate, the reporting physicians should appeal to supervisors in the agency or the agency head to make sure the need for protection is appreciated. The physician should avoid speculation about motivation of the perpetrator or need for her to receive a psychological evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255220\"><span class=\"h3\">Repair iatrogenic harm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the damage caused by MCA can be reversed by stopping the unnecessary care. In our experience, medication side effects go away. Appetite and energy levels return to baseline. When wheelchairs are removed, children begin walking again. Rarely, some interventions may require operative reversal such as removal of gastric tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The psychological effects of having been medicalized, sometimes for many years, are often more difficult to ameliorate. The few studies done on long-term psychological effects indicate children can experience increased incidence of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This impact is similar to the emotional effects of other types of child maltreatment. Both individual psychotherapy for the child and parent as well as family therapy have a place in responding to the psychological sequelae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255226\"><span class=\"h3\">Provide family support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most child protection efforts strive to keep children with their families if this can be done safely. For victims of MCA, this means that the child cannot continue to be exposed to unnecessary medical care and the iatrogenic harms associated with it; the perpetrator has to change her beliefs and behaviors regarding medical issues in her children.</p><p>Psychological evaluation of the perpetrator and psychiatric therapy is a key factor in determining the safety of the child. The motivation that caused parent to expose her child to harm is now critically important. Such evaluation can be mandated by child protective services or in the contract signed by the perpetrator. &#160;</p><p>Sometimes the evaluation and treatment is straightforward:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If she is ignorant or misinformed, the deficit can be rectified by education.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If she acted in an effort to calm her own anxiety, a referral for treatment for an anxiety disorder is indicated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If she is a chronic exaggerator and recognizes this tendency in herself, this knowledge can be included in the ongoing treatment plan by informing the entire treatment team to take everything said by the mother &quot;with a grain of salt.&quot;</p><p/><p>However, in many instances of moderate or severe MCA, getting cooperation from the perpetrator is challenging:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They often have constructed a faulty and elaborate belief system to justify their actions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They believe they are doing the right thing for their child by getting more and more medical care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They think their child has a serious underlying medical condition such as a mitochondrial disorder or an immune deficiency when there is no good medical evidence to support the diagnosis.</p><p/><p>These belief systems can be extensive and persistent. Mothers who have adopted these beliefs can convince other family members, and find validation from the internet where they find other mothers who think similarly.</p><p>In these situations, although it may be helpful to understand why the caregiver has constructed her belief system, more importantly, for her child to remain in her care, the belief system must undergo change. As part of this change, it is essential that the caregiver understand and agree that her behavior exposed her child to danger. In many cases, this agreement is in direct conflict with the belief system she spent years assembling and justifying. Abandoning the belief system and substituting one that relies on verifiable medical evidence can be difficult to do. In our experience, the perpetrator usually requires psychiatric treatment although, in some cases, the realization that she might lose custody of her child is enough to foster the change.</p><p>Helpful psychiatric approaches for the perpetrator include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobilization of extended family members to reinforce the message that harm occurred and change in behavior is needed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family therapy to magnify positive beliefs and challenge destructive ones within the existing network of intimate family relationships</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual psychological treatments to modify beliefs using evidence-based approaches (eg, motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H154312384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Psychotherapies'</a>)</p><p/><p>The starting point for any therapy of perpetrators of MCA must be the understanding that the mother's actions and beliefs exposed the child to significant danger. The therapist must have this in mind at the outset of therapy and continually as therapy progresses. The perpetrator must agree that treatment will result, in due time, in a major modification in her belief system regarding the need for medical care for her child. It is important that the psychotherapist communicates with the medical team that made the diagnosis so that he or she knows the truth about the child's underlying medical conditions and the problems with the mother's response to those conditions. A therapist who joins with the mother and supports her belief systems is unlikely to be helpful in protecting the child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90255238\"><span class=\"h3\">Legal intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Child abuse is a crime. Statutes defining what constitutes child abuse and the potential penalties differ dramatically from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. What is a felony in one locale might be a misdemeanor in another. In some regions, police involvement is routine. In other settings, police investigation is initiated by child protection services.</p><p>Criminal prosecutions and convictions for MCA are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is much more likely a person's act will be considered criminal if induction of a life-threatening act such as suffocation or contamination of a central line is witnessed, either in person or on videotape. More commonly the legal action in extreme cases is termination of parental or custodian rights when the parent is deemed unable to complete treatment successfully, or the parent's actions were particularly damaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589056388\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most mild forms of medical child abuse (MCA) are dealt with by the primary care provider. In these cases, the family can usually be preserved and harm to the child avoided.</p><p>Appropriate management of moderate or severe MCA usually results in the cessation of unnecessary medical care and preservation of the family. In the authors' series of 87 moderate to severe cases, temporary separation of the perpetrating parent from the family happened in 29 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Parental rights were terminated in only five cases and the rest of the parents eventually were reintegrated into the family.

In particular, geographic mobility can hinder efforts to prevent reoccurrence. A family can move across country and resume MCA with a new cast of medical providers. This potential problem underscores the need to involve child protection services and to engage family members, other than the perpetrator, to monitor for and prevent the perpetrator from fleeing with the child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90253011\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical child abuse (MCA) refers to a child receiving unnecessary and harmful or potentially harmful medical care due to a caregiver's overt actions including exaggeration of symptoms, lying about the history, fabricating clinical findings, or intentionally inducing illness in their child. MCA is a type of child abuse. (See <a href=\"#H90255064\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no typical clinical presentation for victims of MCA. They may also have true medical illness or suffer other forms of child abuse. Because the history gathered from a caretaker is the starting point for medical care, symptom constellations that depend upon caregiver report (eg, gastrointestinal complaints such as vomiting or diarrhea; neurologic symptoms such as coma, ataxia, seizures, or apnea; or allergic responses) may occur more commonly. Examples of reported cases of fabricated and induced illness are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59264\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59264 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2019805650\" class=\"local\">'Patient features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of perpetrators of MCA are female. They frequently have a personal history of factitious or somatoform disorder, deprivation or abuse during childhood, self-harm, and alcohol or drug abuse. Characteristics such as having extensive medical knowledge, exhibiting calm during otherwise stressful medical events, being a medical provider, and becoming angry at medical providers who do not agree with them are <strong>not</strong> predictive of MCA but may help raise suspicion. (See <a href=\"#H1446964406\" class=\"local\">'Perpetrator features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MCA presents along a spectrum of illness:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild &ndash; The caregiver repeatedly seeks and often demands unnecessary medical care. They may either exaggerate or lie about symptoms. History from other observers typically differs and suggests no serious illness. The physical examination is either normal or reflects minor illness that requires no intervention. The child is not harmed as long as the physician does not give into the irrational requests for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H4177211750\" class=\"local\">'Perpetrator actions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H90255088\" class=\"local\">'Mild'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate &ndash; The caregiver's deception has resulted in the child receiving medical care that significantly disrupts their life although it is not life-threatening. (See <a href=\"#H4177211750\" class=\"local\">'Perpetrator actions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H90255106\" class=\"local\">'Moderate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe &ndash; The caregiver's fabrication or induction of illness has resulted in the child receiving medical treatment that is potentially life-threatening. (See <a href=\"#H4177211750\" class=\"local\">'Perpetrator actions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H90255118\" class=\"local\">'Severe'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of MCA requires the physician to recognize that the caregiver might be exaggerating, fabricating, or inducing illness in a child. Identifying that the normal <span class=\"nowrap\">doctor/patient</span> relationship has become pathologic is central to making the diagnosis; the physician is now harming the patient rather than helping because of deception on the part of the caregiver. (See <a href=\"#H3083464728\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team and child abuse specialist is warranted in all situations where the physician suspects moderate or severe MCA. Confirmation of MCA is <strong>not</strong> required prior to consultation; a suspicion of MCA is sufficient. Consultation is also encouraged when the physician is not sure whether the caregiver's behavior constitutes MCA and to support physician's efforts to address mild MCA. (See <a href=\"#H253407225\" class=\"local\">'Indications for consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild MCA typically requires no diagnostic evaluation to exclude medical illness and, in many instances, can be managed by the primary care provider. By contrast, moderate or severe MCA requires a coordinated approach to diagnostic evaluation, notification of child protection services, and comprehensive family interventions. Whenever possible, a child abuse specialist should guide this multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment.
