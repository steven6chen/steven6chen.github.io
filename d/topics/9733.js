Among various bariatric procedures, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has rapidly gained popularity to become most frequently performed worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the United States alone, 125,318 LSGs were performed in 2016, which accounted for 58 percent of all bariatric procedures performed that year. That number increased by 18.8 percent from 2015 and 346 percent from 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>LSG entails resecting the greater curvature and fundus of the stomach; the partial gastrectomy is oriented vertically, parallel to the lesser curvature of the stomach. Originally described in the 1990s as the &quot;Magenstrasse and Mill procedure,&quot; the principle of LSG derives from the physiologic &quot;Magenstrasse&quot; (German for &quot;street of the stomach&quot;), which conveys food from the esophagus to the antral &quot;Mill&quot; to be ground and propelled into the duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54612 \">figure 1</a>). Although LSG was initially regarded as a purely restrictive procedure, we now know that it also promotes weight loss by inducing anorexia through removal of the majority of ghrelin-producing cells located in the gastric fundus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Overall, LSG results in excellent weight loss and remission of most obesity-related comorbidities. LSG is also less morbid than some of the other bariatric operations, such as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, because of its technical simplicity and its limited alteration of the normal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) recognizes LSG as either a primary bariatric procedure or the first part of a staged approach in high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The mechanisms of action, indications, techniques, and outcomes of LSG will be discussed here. Other bariatric operations are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3921740882\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LSG promotes weight loss through two principal mechanisms of action, mechanical (creation of restriction) and endocrine (creation of anorexia): </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4165635228\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following LSG, the sleeved stomach is reduced in volume and distensibility, both of which contribute to the restrictive mechanism of weight loss. </p><p>LSG results in a gastric volume reduction of 70 to 80 percent. In a study that quantified the volume and pressure of the stomach immediately before and after LSG, the mean volumes of the original and the sleeved stomach were 1553 mL (600 to 2000 mL) and 129 mL (90 to 220 mL), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In the sleeved stomach, a reduction in volume results in an increase in intraluminal pressure. In the same study cited above, a sleeved stomach filled with saline had a pressure of 43 mmHg (32 to 58 mmHg), compared with 34 mmHg (21 to 45 mmHg) of the original stomach filled with saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The high intraluminal pressure is a significant contributing factor to a higher leak rate associated with LSG. (See <a href=\"#H3604974124\" class=\"local\">'Leak'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2551188673\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been well established that the centrally regulated weight homeostasis is profoundly influenced by a complex interaction of diet, gut, and brain hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These hormones are mainly secreted by the gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissue. LSG alters the levels of such hormones to the advantages of weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65917 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ghrelin</strong> is a 28-amino-acid peptide secreted mainly by the oxyntic glands in the fundus of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The main function of ghrelin is to stimulate appetite. LSG removes the gastric fundus and, therefore, significantly decreases the postprandial levels of ghrelin and promotes weight loss by inducing satiety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ghrelin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ghrelin&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glucagon-like peptide-1</strong> (GLP-1) is a 30-amino-acid peptide mainly secreted by the small intestine L cells after contact of food. This hormone increases insulin secretion (incretin effect) on one end and slows gastric emptying and intestinal motility on the other (ileal brake) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59551 \">figure 2</a>). GLP-1 is increased after LSG, and it is postulated that increased levels of GLP-1 contribute to weight loss by improving glucose metabolism, reducing hunger, and increasing satiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a study of 18 obese type 2 diabetic patients, glucose-induced early insulin secretion increased after LSG, whereas late insulin secretion decreased. The latter is thought to be due to increased insulin peripheral sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although GLP-1 has been shown to slow gastric emptying, the gastric emptying time accelerated after LSG (47.6&plusmn;23.2 versus 94.3&plusmn;15.4 minutes) in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is likely that more than one mechanism is in play when determining the gastric transit time after LSG. GLP-1 is further discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glucagon-like peptide-1'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LSG has also been shown to alter the levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], bile acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], and leptin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], the clinical significance of which is still under investigation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2155025956\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to other bariatric operations, LSG is indicated in all patients meeting the 1991 National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These criteria include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation#H2963932\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body mass index (BMI) &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> with or without any associated comorbidities. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMI between 35 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> with at least one serious weight-related comorbidity, including but not limited to diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.</p><p/><p>In addition, LSG may also be indicated for patients with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMI between 30 and 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> with uncontrollable type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.</p><p/><p>Besides being a primary bariatric operation, LSG has also been used as a bridging procedure in super morbid obese patients (BMI of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and above) before biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Additionally, LSG is also a good revisional procedure for patients who fail laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>According to a consensus statement released by an expert panel representing 24 centers in 11 countries, LSG is safe for patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although some bariatric surgeons disagree, the majority of the experts consider LSG an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. LSG can also be offered to high-risk patients such as those with Child's A or B liver cirrhosis and those awaiting kidney or liver transplant (with the goal of improving future graft function) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Finally, LSG has been safely performed in both adolescents and older adult patients. </p><p>Absolute contraindications to LSG include prohibitive anesthesia risks, severe uncontrolled psychiatric illnesses (including certain eating disorders such as malignant hyperphagia), and coagulopathy. Barrett's esophagus and uncontrolled severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are relative contraindications to LSG. </p><p>Some surgeons do not perform LSG in the presence of Barrett's esophagus, for fear that a sleeve gastrectomy would preclude a future gastric pull-up procedure, which may be required if Barrett's esophagus progresses to esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Others do not consider Barrett's esophagus a contraindication to LSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Hiatal hernia without esophagitis is not a contraindication to LSG. </p><p>Performing LSG in patients with known GERD is controversial, with evidence existing for both exacerbation and improvement of GERD symptoms after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a better surgical option of weight loss than LSG in patients with severe GERD. Patients who develop debilitating symptoms of GERD after LSG may require conversion to RYGB. (See <a href=\"#H137702294\" class=\"local\">'GERD'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2631735589\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE WORKUP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to any bariatric surgery, patients need to undergo psychologic, medical, and anesthetic risk assessment, the details of which are discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation#H2967550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;, section on 'Preoperative assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to LSG, patients with upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms (eg, acid reflux, dysphagia) can be evaluated, at the surgeon's discretion, with an upper gastrointestinal contrast series (UGI) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to exclude ulcers, polyps, masses, or dysplastic changes and to identify any anatomical abnormalities such as a hiatal hernia. </p><p>Such patients may also undergo esophageal pH testing and manometry to assess the severity of any existing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and exclude esophageal motility disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are not considered contraindications to LSG, they could potentially be addressed before or at the same time of LSG. (See <a href=\"#H137702294\" class=\"local\">'GERD'</a> below.)</p><p>Although a baseline gallbladder ultrasound is usually performed prior to LSG, the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease developing after LSG is lower than that after gastric bypass. Additionally, biliary diseases such as choledocholithiasis are also easier to treat after LSG than after gastric bypass because LSG maintains normal duodenal anatomy, which permits per oral endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080988391\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LSG is a vertically oriented gastrectomy that removes approximately 70 to 80 percent of the greater curvature of the stomach, resulting in the creation of a narrow gastric tube with a volume of approximately 150 to 200 mL based on the less distensible lesser curvature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54612 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The remnant stomach after LSG is referred to as a sleeved stomach or simply &quot;sleeve.&quot; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4112527116\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is positioned supine on and appropriately secured to the operating table. All pressure points are padded, and a mechanical deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis device is applied. The surgeon and the camera holder stand on the patient's right side; the first assistant and surgical technician stand on the patient's left side. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3852508087\"><span class=\"h2\">Trocar placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although variability exists, the authors' preference is to access the abdomen via a supraumbilical gasless optical trocar. Once pneumoperitoneum has been established, additional trocars are inserted under direct vision:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 5-mm trocar is inserted in the subxiphoid area for the liver retractor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 5-mm trocar is placed in the left upper quadrant at the anterior axillary line just below the 12<sup>th</sup> rib for the assistant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional 12-mm trocars are placed in the right upper quadrant, epigastrium, left upper quadrant, and right paramedian regions for inserting staplers. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345912284\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify pylorus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to identify the pylorus by visualizing the prepyloric vein of Mayo and palpating with laparoscopic instruments. The pylorus is a crucial landmark because gastric transection typically begins 2 to 6 cm from the pylorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Some surgeons transect the stomach close to the pylorus (eg, 2 cm), while others begin the gastric transection further away from the pylorus (eg, 6 cm) to preserve the entire gastric antrum to ensure proper gastric emptying postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177137133\"><span class=\"h2\">Mobilize greater curvature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the site of future gastric transection is identified, the greater curvature of the stomach is devascularized using an advanced vessel-sealing device. This process is continued proximally onto the posterior fundus until the left crus of the diaphragmatic hiatus is clearly identified. All the short gastric vessels should be divided along the way. A complete mobilization of the greater curvature ensures that a sizable portion of the posterior fundus is not left behind during gastric transection. Although the merit of such mobilization was once debated, it has been accepted by the majority of experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584585596\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess hiatus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At this point, most surgeons would assess the hiatus for hernias. Any large hiatal hernia should be repaired using standard laparoscopic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The blood supply to the lesser curvature (ie, left gastric artery) must be preserved since it will become the sole blood supply to the sleeve after gastric transection. The technique of hiatal hernia repair is discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia#H16016808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of paraesophageal hernia&quot;, section on 'Transabdominal repair'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83274759\"><span class=\"h2\">Insert bougie</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bougie is then inserted transorally by the anesthesiologist, advanced under direct vision to the pylorus, and positioned against the lesser curvature. Although experts agree on the need for calibrating the sleeved stomach with a bougie, the optimal size of such a bougie is still debated. The majority of experts, however, agree that the optimal bougie size is 40 French [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Using a bougie smaller than 32 French could make the sleeve too tight, which increases the risks of leak and stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1931312517\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> below), whereas using a larger bougie could result in loss of restriction and weight regain over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H231977321\"><span class=\"h2\">Transect stomach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gastric transection is then performed using sequential applications of 60-mm linear staplers beginning at a point 2 to 6 cm proximal to the pylorus. As the gastric transection proceeds, the height of the staples may need to be adjusted according to the thickness of the tissue. In general, most experts would not use staples with closed height &lt;2.0 mm to transect the antrum (the thicker part of the stomach) or staples with closed height &lt;1.5 mm to transect the rest of the stomach (thinner parts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>While transecting the stomach, the surgeon must avoid twisting the staple line along the longitudinal axis and avoid narrowing the sleeve, particularly at the level of the incisura angularis. A twisted or narrowed sleeve can cause distal obstruction, which is responsible for the majority of the occurrences and persistence of staple line leaks in the proximal sleeve (see <a href=\"#H3604974124\" class=\"local\">'Leak'</a> below). Constant symmetric lateral traction during the transection provided by the assistant is paramount to avoiding corkscrewing, twisting, or narrowing of the sleeve. When performing the last stapler firing, it is important to avoid stapling too close to the gastroesophageal junction, which may result in ischemia and postoperative leak.</p><p>Most experts recommend reinforcing the staple line to reduce the risk of bleeding and leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This can be accomplished by using a buttressing material at the time of stapler firing or by oversewing the staple line. A combination of buttressing and oversewing, however, increased staple line leak rate compared with either method alone in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Oversewing should be done with the bougie still in place to avoid excessive imbrication and narrowing of the sleeve lumen.</p><p>After the stomach is transected and the staple line oversewn, an intraoperative leak test can be performed. However, most surgeons do not perform such a test. In a multicenter study of over 4000 patients undergoing LSG, 0.9 percent developed a postoperative leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The intraoperative leak test had a sensitivity of only 8.7 percent and was negative in 91 percent of patients who later developed a postoperative leak. Leak rates were not different between centers that performed intraoperative leak test routinely versus selectively. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3739268006\"><span class=\"h2\">Extract specimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The resected portion of the stomach is extracted through the periumbilical trocar site. The enlarged trocar site is then closed, completing the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H859698380\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite considerable national variation in clinical pathways used by bariatric centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], most patients are admitted for overnight observation after LSG, especially if they have a history of obstructive sleep apnea. Postoperative nausea is the most common complaint and should be treated with scheduled doses of intravenous antiemetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, with other antiemetics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> patch, provided as needed for breakthrough symptoms. Minimizing narcotic use by liberal use of local anesthetic infiltration, transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> also contributes to the reduction of postoperative nausea and early discharge. </p><p>A clear liquid diet is usually started in the morning after the procedure. If the patient tolerates that, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> can be advanced to a full liquid diet within 24 hours.

It can occur within the lumen of the stomach, intra-abdominally, or at the <span class=\"nowrap\">trocar/incision</span> sites. </p><p>The source of intra-abdominal bleeding can usually be found along the greater curvature of the stomach, most commonly originating from the short gastric vessels or the spleen. Because the fundus of the stomach is in close proximity to the spleen, it is not uncommon to injure the spleen during LSG by either traction or burn to the splenic capsule. Small capsular tears can be managed with persistent and prolonged pressure and topical hemostatic agents, whereas larger tears and uncontrolled bleeding from the spleen might necessitate a splenectomy. Good exposure to the left upper quadrant during LSG is paramount to preventing this complication.</p><p>LSG creates likely the longest staple line in surgery. A long staple line in a well-vascularized organ is a perfect setup for both intraluminal and intra-abdominal bleeding. While intra-abdominal bleeding can be readily visualized and treated with clips, sutures, or fibrin glue, it is more difficult to diagnose intraluminal bleeding. After LSG, the combination of hematemesis or melena with a dropping hematocrit is suggestive of intraluminal bleeding. Evidence exists that staple line reinforcement reduces the risk of staple line bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. While most episodes of intraluminal bleeding are self-limited, some may require endoscopic or surgical intervention. In addition to incurring blood loss, a bleeding staple line may also be weak and susceptible to leak. (See <a href=\"#H3604974124\" class=\"local\">'Leak'</a> below.)</p><p>Bleeding at laparoscopic <span class=\"nowrap\">trocar/incision</span> sites is rare but can be both insidious and significant. Immediate bleeding can be detected and treated by directly observing the trocar site after removal of the trocar. Delayed bleeding usually starts after the pneumoperitoneum is evacuated and the systemic blood pressure increases and can cause hematoma formation at the trocar site. Laparoscopic <span class=\"nowrap\">trocar/incision</span> site bleeding and hematoma are discussed in another topic.

As explained above, the high luminal pressure is generated by a narrow sleeved stomach sealed between an intact pylorus and lower esophageal sphincter. Leaks that occur after LSG are also less likely to close spontaneously because of the high luminal pressure. (See <a href=\"#H4165635228\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical'</a> above.)</p><p>Other etiologies, besides a high intraluminal pressure, that also contribute to staple line leaks include ischemia, hematoma formation, and staple misfiring. Besides (rare) manufacturing issues, staple misfiring can be due to improper use of the stapler or improper selection of the staple height. When choosing staple cartridges, surgeons must be aware of the progressive decrease in the thickness of the gastric wall from the antrum to the fundus and adjust the staple height accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H231977321\" class=\"local\">'Transect stomach'</a> above.)</p><p>Based on the timing of onset, leaks can be classified as acute (within seven days), early (within one to six weeks), late (after six weeks), and chronic (after 12 weeks). The preferred treatment of leaks varies according to the timing of the leak. The following recommendations were suggested by an expert panel during a 2011 consensus conference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and were subsequently endorsed by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery as best practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unstable patient with a contained or uncontained symptomatic leak requires immediate reoperation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with fever and tachycardia but normal imaging studies requires surgical exploration to exclude a leak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stable patients, endoluminal stenting is a valid treatment option for an acute proximal leak that has failed conservative therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenting has limited efficacy for chronic leaks.

It converts a high-pressure system (LSG with distal obstruction) to a lower-pressure system (RYGB), which promotes healing of the <span class=\"nowrap\">leak/fistula</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98385000\"><span class=\"h2\">Stricture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although sleeve strictures have been reported in 0.26 to 4 percent of LSG operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/66-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-73</a>], &lt;1 percent result in symptoms that require endoscopic or surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. A stricture can manifest acutely, early after surgery, or more chronically. Although strictures can occur anywhere along the long staple line, they are most often located at the level of the incisura angularis for anatomic reasons. </p><p>The etiologies of post-LSG strictures are either mechanical or functional. Mechanical strictures usually derive from the use of small bougies, stapling too close to the bougie (especially at the incisura angularis), twisting of the staple line creating a &quot;spiral&quot; sleeve, or aggressive imbrication of the staple line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Functional stenoses derive from edema or hematomas at the staple line. As a result, functional stenoses are transient, which present immediately following LSG and resolve spontaneously with expectant treatment. </p><p>Patients who present with obstructive symptoms during the early postoperative period should be resuscitated with hydration and antiemetic medications and studied with an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series. Stable patients with a stricture can be observed to allow postsurgical mucosal edema to resolve, typically in 24 to 48 hours. Patients who cannot handle their own secretions require nasogastric tube decompression, preferably placed under fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p>Patients with an acute stricture who do not respond to conservative management require early surgical reintervention. Laparoscopy could demonstrate kinking of the gastric tube, a tight suture, or a compressing hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Sutures used to oversew the staple line should be removed, after which an intraoperative endoscopy should be performed to confirm the resolution of the stricture. If no suture was used to oversew the staple line or if the stricture persists after all sutures have been removed, a seromyotomy of the greater curvature side of the sleeve can be performed to relieve the stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The seromyotomy should be carried out from the antrum to the proximal sleeve using ultrasonic or monopolar energy, with the denuded mucosa covered with omentum.</p><p>By contrast, patients with chronic strictures often present with mild symptoms that mimic acid reflux.

LSG promotes weight loss by mechanical restriction of the gastric <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/distensibility</span> and by hormonal induction of satiety and anorexia. (See <a href=\"#H2981715572\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3921740882\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for LSG are the same as for other bariatric procedures, namely body mass index (BMI) &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> BMI between 35 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> with one or more comorbid conditions, or BMI between 30 and 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. LSG is safe for select high-risk patients as well as for both adolescent and older adult patients. (See <a href=\"#H2155025956\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute contraindications to LSG include prohibitive anesthesia risks, severe uncontrolled psychiatric illnesses (including certain eating disorders such as malignant hyperphagia), and coagulopathy. Barrett's esophagus and uncontrolled severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are relative contraindications to LSG. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a better surgical option of weight loss than LSG in patients with severe GERD. Patients who develop debilitating symptoms of GERD after LSG may require conversion to RYGB. (See <a href=\"#H2631735589\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative workup'</a> above and <a href=\"#H137702294\" class=\"local\">'GERD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LSG is a vertically oriented gastrectomy that removes approximately 70 to 80 percent of the greater curvature of the stomach, resulting in the creation of a narrow gastric tube with a volume of approximately 150 to 200 mL based on the less distensible lesser curvature. (See <a href=\"#H4080988391\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greater curvature of the stomach is transected with sequential firing of staplers beginning at 2 to 6 cm from the pylorus. The sleeve should be calibrated with a 40-French bougie placed against the lesser curvature of the stomach. The greater curvature should be completely mobilized and retracted laterally to avoid narrowing (especially at incisura angularis), twisting, or spiraling of the sleeve during transection. Staple height should be constantly adjusted according to the thickness of the gastric wall. After gastric transection, the long staple line should be reinforced by buttressing or oversewing. (See <a href=\"#H4080988391\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are admitted for overnight observation after LSG and treated for nausea. Clear liquid diet is allowed on the first postoperative day, and patients are discharged home with instructions to only take crushed or liquid medications and a full liquid diet for two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H859698380\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At five years after LSG, the average patient loses 60.5 percent of excess body weight and achieves a BMI of 30.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. LSG has also been associated with improvement or resolution of type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H2791075920\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In modern series, the overall mortality rate of LSG is approximately 0.3 percent; the overall morbidity rates range from 2.9 to 15.3 percent. LSGs have one-half the risk-adjusted odds of death, serious morbidity, and leak in the first 30 days compared with LRYGB. Major surgical complications include bleeding, leak, stricture, and portal vein thrombosis. These complications can be treated nonoperatively, endoscopically, or surgically (eg, converting to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) depending on severity and chronicity. (See <a href=\"#H1931312517\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ponce J, DeMaria EJ, Nguyen NT, et al.
