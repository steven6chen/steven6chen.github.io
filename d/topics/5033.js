It encompasses abnormal development of the acetabulum and proximal femur and mechanical instability of the hip joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88588\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88588 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p>Newborns often have physiologic laxity of the hip and immaturity of the acetabulum during the first few weeks of life. In most cases, the laxity resolves, and the acetabulum proceeds to develop normally. With assessment of risk factors, serial physical examination of the hips, and appropriate use of imaging studies, most children with pathologic hips can be correctly diagnosed and treated without long-term sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Typical DDH, which generally occurs in otherwise healthy infants, will be the focus of this topic review. Hip dysplasia and instability also occur in association with other conditions. Teratologic hip dysplasia occurs in association with various syndromes (eg, Ehlers-Danlos, Down syndrome, arthrogryposis), and neuromuscular hip dysplasia occurs when there is weakness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spasticity in some or all of the hip muscle groups (eg, in spina bifida or cerebral palsy). The diagnosis and management of teratologic and neuromuscular hip dysplasia differ from the diagnosis and management of hip dysplasia in otherwise healthy infants.</p><p>Treatment of DDH is initiated with referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon or other orthopedic surgeon who is familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. The treatment and outcome of DDH in otherwise healthy children will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, natural history, clinical features, and diagnosis are discussed separately.

In observational studies, there is a high rate of resolution of neonatal hip instability without intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. In a cohort of 11,989 infants, 60 percent of hips that demonstrated instability on physical examination at birth stabilized in the first week of life, and nearly 90 percent stabilized by 2 months and were functionally and radiographically normal at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A dislocated hip may function well for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, over time, there may be gradual progression of functional disability, pain, and accelerated osteoarthritis. The risk of these complications is not well defined, but may be associated with the development of a false acetabulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/2,3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,11</a>].</p><p>The natural history of untreated dysplasia in a reduced or subluxated hip is variable. In infants and young children, radiographic abnormalities may improve with time because the acetabulum still has excellent remodeling potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. However, after school age, the likelihood of spontaneous improvement is low. Patients with persistent dysplasia without dislocation may develop activity-related hip pain or osteoarthritis in adolescence or young adulthood. Pain may start soon after skeletal maturity, or, in females, during the first or second pregnancy or at menopause. Patients 40 to 60 years old who present with hip osteoarthritis are often found to have mild dysplasia as a contributing cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

In the young child, concentric reduction provides an optimal environment for the development of the femoral head and acetabulum. In the older child, who has completed development of the hip joint, concentric reduction helps to prevent or postpone development of osteoarthritis of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Previous injury'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal environment for development of the femoral head and acetabulum is one in which the cartilaginous surface of the femoral head is in contact with the cartilaginous floor of the acetabulum. Both the femoral head and the acetabulum have the capacity for growth and reshaping, which can result in gradual resolution of dysplasia over time (months to years) if concentric reduction is maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>]. The upper age limit for acetabular remodeling has been estimated between 18 months and 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], with maximal acetabular remodeling 4 to 6 years after reduction of the dislocated hip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94372\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94372 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Concentric reduction is the goal no matter when DDH is diagnosed.

In a retrospective review of 176 children treated with Pavlik harness for hip instability at &le;6 months of age, the timing of initiation of Pavlik harness therapy was not associated with treatment failure (defined as requiring surgery for definitive management) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

These types of DDH are unlikely to resolve without treatment and may result in functional disability, pain, and accelerated osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"#H513167230\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of untreated DDH'</a> above.)</p><p>The Pavlik harness is the most thoroughly studied and most commonly used abduction splint worldwide and the only one that will be discussed in this topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The Frejka pillow is another type of abduction device used in the treatment of DDH, but it has been associated with an increased rate of avascular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-37</a>].</p><p>We recommend not using double- or triple-diapering for the treatment of DDH.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Embryology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pavlik harness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest treatment with a Pavlik harness rather than other abduction splints for infants younger than six months with hip dislocation or persistently dislocatable or subluxatable hips. The Pavlik harness is the most thoroughly studied and most commonly used abduction splint.</p><p>The Pavlik harness is a dynamic splint that prevents hip extension and limits adduction (which can lead to dislocation), but permits flexion and abduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66556 \">figure 4</a>). This positioning promotes normal development of a dysplastic hip, stabilization of a subluxated hip, and usually leads to gradual reduction of a dislocated hip, even if it is not reducible on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Contraindications to the use of the Pavlik harness include muscle imbalance (spina bifida), severe stiffness (arthrogryposis), excessive laxity (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), age older than 10 months, and a family situation in which consistent and careful use cannot be guaranteed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/23,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,39</a>].</p><p>The Pavlik harness is typically fit with hip flexion of 100&deg; and adduction limited to within three fingerbreadths of the midline (ie, the knees should be separated by six fingerbreadths when brought to the midline). Abduction is not forced but encouraged via gravity. In the setting of rapid infant growth, weekly or biweekly adjustments are necessary to maintain the ideal position. Parents are cautioned regarding hyperflexion and hyperabduction of the hips, which may cause femoral nerve palsy and osteonecrosis, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Ultrasonography is used to monitor treatment.</p><p>We generally suggest that the harness be worn for 23 hours per day (ie, except during bathing) for the first six weeks or until the hip is stabilized. Once the hip is stabilized, the harness is used during sleep for the next six weeks.</p><p>The duration of treatment varies depending upon age, severity, and response. Two to three months of treatment is usually necessary for patients who demonstrate improvement with the Pavlik harness. A combination of clinical examination demonstrating a stable hip and ultrasonography demonstrating improved acetabular development are used to determine when treatment can be discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/10,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,41</a>].</p><p>Treatment with the Pavlik harness should be discontinued after<strong> </strong>three weeks if a dislocated hip has not reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. After failure of reduction with a Pavlik harness, a rigid abduction orthosis (ie, brace that holds the hip[s] in abduction, but unlike the Pavlik harness is not flexible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99348\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99348 \">figure 5</a>)) may be used to gain reduction. In a single institution case series, 13 of 15 hips that failed treatment in a Pavlik harness were successfully reduced with a rigid abduction orthosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Reduction under anesthesia is usually required if reduction with a rigid abduction orthosis is unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Age 6 to 18 months or failure of abduction splint'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment with a Pavlik harness is effective, but evidence from randomized trials is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In observational studies, dislocatable or subluxatable hips improve in approximately 95 percent of cases when treated with the Pavlik harness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. The success rate for complete dislocation is approximately 85 percent (with success defined as achievement and maintenance of hip reduction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/42,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,46</a>]. Early failure of the Pavlik harness treatment is more likely when there is low percentage coverage (&lt;20 percent) of the femoral head, a high dislocation (ie, one in which the femoral head has migrated superiorly), or irreducible dislocation on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/40,49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,49-52</a>]. In a retrospective study, the age at which Pavlik harness treatment was initiated was the most important predictor of outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The risk of failure was increased when treatment was initiated after four months of age.</p><p>To avoid complications, Pavlik harness treatment should be instituted by an orthopedic surgeon who is experienced in the evaluation and treatment of DDH. Although Pavlik harness treatment is usually safe, complications may occur. The most serious complication is osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) of the femoral head, which can result in permanent damage to the femoral head and acetabulum. The reported incidence of osteonecrosis varies widely (from 0 to 16 percent), depending upon the age and severity at initiation of treatment and the duration of follow-up; in most case series, the reported incidence is between 0 and 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/46,49,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49,54,55</a>]. Proper fit and wear of the harness decrease the risk of osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Residual dysplasia is uncommon, occurring in approximately 3 percent of treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Follow-up radiographs are performed to monitor acetabular development. Most patients show gradual correction by age 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/12,18,24,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,24,46</a>]. If dysplasia persists past three to four years of age, surgical treatment is commonly recommended. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Long-term follow-up'</a> below and <a href=\"#H562776460\" class=\"local\">'Residual or late-presenting acetabular dysplasia'</a> below.)</p><p>Femoral nerve palsy is another important complication. In a retrospective review of 1218 patients who were treated with a Pavlik harness for DDH, femoral nerve palsy occurred in 2.5 percent, almost always within the first week of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Femoral nerve palsy resolved in all patients, usually within 14 days. Compared with patients who did not develop femoral nerve palsy, those who did were older at diagnosis (56 versus 22 days), heavier (4.8 versus 3.7 kg), and had more severe disease (ie, reducible or fixed dislocation versus laxity or dysplasia).</p><p>Skin breakdown may affect adherence to Pavlik harness therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In a prospective study of 160 parents of children undergoing treatment with a Pavlik harness, dermatitis in the groin or popliteal fossa was reported by 12.5 percent of parents, dermatitis of the shoulder by 9.4 percent, and dermatitis of the leg by 8.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Suggestions for preventing skin breakdown include keeping the skin as clean and dry as possible; avoiding lotions, powders, and creams under the harness; and changing diapers frequently or using leak-proof diapers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Other complications may include brachial plexus palsy, knee subluxation, inferior dislocation, and Pavlik disease (flattening of the posterior acetabulum caused by excessive hip abduction and flexion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>]. The frequency of these complications is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysplasia without dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of infants younger than six months with dysplasia without dislocation is determined on a case-by-case basis. Decisions generally are made by the orthopedic surgeon in conjunction with the child's parents after discussion of the risks and benefits of therapy versus observation.</p><p>We usually suggest treatment with the Pavlik harness if isolated acetabular dysplasia (Graf type IIa or worse) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56551%7EPEDS%2F80478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56551 graphicRef80478 \">figure 3A-B</a>) persists beyond six weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, other centers may have different thresholds for intervention in infants with dysplasia without dislocation. We monitor treatment with ultrasonography every four to six weeks until the ultrasonographic measurements become normal, at which point use of the Pavlik harness is weaned over six weeks. Follow-up radiographs are obtained at six months of age and regularly until skeletal maturity. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pavlik harness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Long-term follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Data supporting treatment over observation are limited. On the one hand, there is some evidence that dysplasia resolves over time without treatment, suggesting that few patients are likely to benefit from treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/14,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,64</a>]. On the other hand, treatment with abduction splinting has few risks but a large potential benefit for the small number of infants in whom dysplasia would persist or worsen without treatment and who would possibly require surgical intervention. In a prospective study in which 780 Graf type IIa hips were followed ultrasonographically, worsening occurred in 5.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE 6 TO 18 MONTHS OR FAILURE OF ABDUCTION SPLINT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562776512\"><span class=\"h2\">Dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Closed or open reduction performed in the operating room under anesthesia usually is necessary for children with DDH who are older than six months at the time of diagnosis or initiation of therapy and infants who fail treatment with abduction splinting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In children older than six months, the rate of successful reduction with Pavlik harness treatment is less than 50 percent, and there is a higher risk of osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) of the femoral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4336697\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthopedic specialists at most centers, including the author's, recommend treatment of the dislocated hip soon after the diagnosis is made. The age of the child and development of the hip joint at the time of treatment affect outcome. In observational studies, the earlier the hip is reduced, the more likely the success of closed reduction; the older the patient, the more likely the need for open reduction and possible femoral and pelvic osteotomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].</p><p>The practice of early reduction is supported by an observational study in which reduction before ossification of the capital femoral epiphysis was associated with decreased rate of subsequent reconstructive surgery (eg, varus rotational osteotomy, pelvic osteotomy) compared with reduction after ossification (22 versus 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The presence or absence of ossification of the capital femoral epiphysis at the time of reduction has been thought to affect the risk of osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. However, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 observational studies (only three of which were prospective), including 1655 patients, did not find an association between ossification of the capital femoral epiphysis and the risk of osteonecrosis (of any grade) or of more severe osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Closed reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of closed reduction is to place the femoral head into the acetabulum and to maintain it in this position with a spica cast. Closed reduction involves gentle manipulation of the hip to achieve reduction. Closed reduction is performed under general anesthesia using intraoperative arthrography and fluoroscopic imaging to guide positioning. Release of tight adductors may be necessary to increase hip abduction and facilitate positioning. Wide abduction should be avoided to decrease the risk of osteonecrosis.</p><p>It is important that reduction is achieved with gentle manipulation. Forced reduction and reduction requiring a high degree of abduction are likely to result in complications or poor outcomes (eg, redislocation, osteonecrosis). If it is not possible to reduce the hip with gentle manipulation (with or without release of adductors), closed reduction is abandoned and open reduction is performed. (See <a href=\"#H363694630\" class=\"local\">'Open reduction'</a> below.)</p><p>Once concentric reduction is confirmed, a spica cast is applied to maintain the position. After a successful closed reduction, the spica cast should hold the hips in 100&deg; of flexion and 40 to 50&deg; of abduction (ie, the &quot;human position&quot;). Three-dimensional imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is usually obtained immediately postoperatively to confirm reduction. Specially formatted &quot;spica MRI&quot; facilitates a shorter time for image acquisition without need for sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Contrast enhancement may provide additional information about femoral epiphyseal perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Casting is typically continued for three to four months after closed reduction. Cast changes and repeat hip arthrography may be performed at six-week intervals as clinically necessary. Following treatment in the spica cast, some centers transition to a rigid abduction orthosis for 6 to 12 weeks.</p><p>The outcomes of closed reduction vary depending upon severity and other clinical factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>].

Open reduction is typically performed after an unsuccessful attempt at closed reduction or primarily in patients who are older than 18 months.</p><p>Open reduction can be performed through a medial or an anterior incision. The hip capsule is opened to remove the obstacles to reduction including medial capsular constriction, inverted labrum, neolimbus, pulvinar, hypertrophied ligamentum teres and transverse acetabular ligament, and tight iliopsoas tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88589 \">figure 6</a>). Capsulorrhaphy may be performed to remove redundant capsule, tighten the remaining capsule, and improve stability. Additional procedures, such as femoral or pelvic osteotomies and adductor tenotomy, may be required to increase hip stability.</p><p>After open reduction, a spica cast is placed with the hips held in approximately 30&deg; of flexion and 30&deg; of abduction to avoid postoperative flexion contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Postoperative three-dimensional imaging (eg, CT, MRI) is typically obtained to confirm reduction.</p><p>Casting typically is continued for six weeks to three months after open reduction. Cast changes may be performed at six-week intervals as clinically necessary. We generally remove the cast six weeks after open reduction and begin night-time abduction splinting with a rigid abduction orthosis, which is continued for six weeks.</p><p>The outcomes of open reduction vary depending upon severity and other clinical factors. In long-term follow-up of patients from one institution (1955 to 1995), approximately 50 percent of patients required additional surgery for dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Complications of open reduction include redislocation, osteonecrosis, infection, scar, and stiffness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708023158\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysplasia without dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence to guide the management of children older than six months with dysplasia without dislocation. The author usually recommends treatment with a part-time or full-time abduction orthosis, such as a rhino abduction brace or a spica cast. This allows improved positioning of the femoral head within the acetabulum to promote acetabular development during a time when there is good potential for acetabular remodeling. Support for abduction bracing is provided by a retrospective study from a single institution comparing part-time bracing with observation in 70 hips (48 patients) with residual acetabular dysplasia (acetabular index &ge;30&deg;) at six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Bracing during night and naps was associated with greater improvement in acetabular index at 12 months of age (5.3 versus 1.1&deg;).</p><p>Treatment with a part-time or full-time abduction orthosis is reasonable up to the age of three or four years. If by that age there is still evidence of acetabular dysplasia, the orthopedic surgeon may recommend continued observation with serial radiographs every 6 to 12 months or proceed with pelvic osteotomy to correct dysplasia. The duration of observation of acetabular dysplasia and the age at which an osteotomy may be recommended varies from center to center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE &ge;18 MONTHS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610208697\"><span class=\"h2\">Dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children &ge;18 months of age with hip dislocation, the risks and benefits of reduction are weighed against the natural history of untreated hip dislocation. The major risks of surgery in children &ge;18 months of age include osteonecrosis and proximal femoral growth disturbance, residual dysplasia, and the need for additional surgeries. Benefits of successful surgery include correction of leg length discrepancy and prevention or postponement of development of osteoarthritis of the hip. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goal of treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H513167230\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of untreated DDH'</a> above.)</p><p>The earlier the reduction is performed, the more time there is for acetabular growth and remodeling and the more likely the benefits of surgery will outweigh the risks. Reduction of unilateral dislocation generally is undertaken until 9 or 10 years of age and reduction of bilateral dislocations until approximately 8 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. After age 9 or 10 (for unilateral dislocations) or 8 (for bilateral dislocations), surgical outcomes are likely to be less satisfactory than the untreated natural history. Older patients with dislocations often have already developed femoral head deformities, which decrease the likelihood of achieving a concentric reduction. In addition, the rate of osteonecrosis after open reduction in older patients is much higher than that in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/4,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,81</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H513167230\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of untreated DDH'</a> above.)</p><p>After &ge;18 months of age, closed reduction of a dislocated hip is less likely to be successful, and open reduction is usually required. Concomitant procedures (eg, adductor tenotomy, iliopsoas release, capsulorrhaphy, femoral shortening and derotational osteotomy, acetabular osteotomy) also are more likely to be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/78,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,82-84</a>].</p><p>Although the risk of poor outcome (eg, failure of reduction, residual dysplasia, osteonecrosis, proximal femoral growth disturbance) is increased when reduction is performed in older compared with younger children, many patients achieve satisfactory outcomes, particularly when femoral shortening osteotomy is performed concomitant with reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/83,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,85,86</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective series, among 22 hips in children with bilateral dislocation who underwent open reduction at &ge;3 years of age, the outcome in 16 was excellent or good (using a clinical and radiographic scoring system); however, 4 patients had leg length discrepancy of approximately 1.5 cm, and 12 developed osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

Acetabular remodeling after age five years is unlikely to achieve concentric reduction.</p><p>Treatment usually involves acetabular osteotomy with or without femoral osteotomy.

Children treated for hip dysplasia should have regular radiographs until they are skeletally mature to ensure that the hip is developing normally and to look for late complications or sequelae (eg, recurrent or residual dysplasia, osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis).
