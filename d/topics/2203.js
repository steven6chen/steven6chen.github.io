Doctors use different methods to do breast biopsies. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a large needle to take 1 or more small samples of tissue from the breast.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do an operation to take out part or all of the abnormal tissue.</p><p/><p>You might get a breast biopsy if you or your doctor can feel a change in your breast, or if an area looks abnormal on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breast ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mammogram &ndash; This is a special kind of X-ray.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698267200\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a breast biopsy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your experience will depend on the type of biopsy you have. The choice is based on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size and location of the abnormal area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What the abnormal area looks like on your ultrasound or mammogram</p><p/><p>For all breast biopsies, you will get an injection (shot) to numb the area of your breast that will be biopsied.</p><p>The 3 main types of biopsies are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fine needle biopsy &ndash; For this type of biopsy, the doctor uses a very small needle to remove a small amount of tissue or fluid from the abnormal area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Core needle biopsy &ndash; For this type of biopsy, the doctor uses a larger needle with a special tip. Often the doctor will also use special imaging equipment to find the abnormal area to take the biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One option is an &quot;ultrasound-guided&quot; breast biopsy. If you have this type of biopsy, you will lie on your back or side and the doctor will hold the ultrasound device against your breast to guide the needle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86543 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The other option is a &quot;stereotactic&quot; biopsy. If you have this type of biopsy, you will lie face down on a table. The table has an opening for your breast, which is pressed between 2 metal plates, just like it is during a mammogram. During this type of biopsy, the doctor takes an X-ray to decide where to insert the needle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86544 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After a core needle biopsy, your doctor will place a tiny piece of metal, called a clip, in your breast. The clip can be seen on an ultrasound or X-ray, so that in the future, doctors can see where the biopsy was taken. You cannot feel the clip and it will not cause problems during future imaging tests, including airport screening tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical biopsy &ndash; For this type of biopsy, you will get medicines to help you relax and feel sleepy through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; The surgeon will make a small cut (incision) in your breast and take out the abnormal tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698267251\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a breast biopsy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a biopsy, you might have bruising, bleeding, or get an infection. These problems are less common with fine or core needle biopsy than after a surgical biopsy.</p><p>You will likely get the results of your biopsy in about a week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698267271\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breast-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breast problems (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-guide-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer guide to diagnosis and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
