However, there is great variability in disease course among individual patients with IPF, and survival is influenced by several factors including variable progression rates, occurrence of acute exacerbations, and comorbid disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114394 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2910560838\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The median survival of IPF has been reported to range from two to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This estimate reflects the range of average life expectancies observed in cohorts of IPF patients, rather than the limits of an individual patient's life expectancy. This nuance is important, as the actual range of survival of individual IPF patients is quite broad, with up to 20 to 25 percent of patients living beyond 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>There are several caveats to interpretation of reported survival estimates for IPF. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, available estimates have largely been generated from cohorts of patients seen at specialty referral centers, and thus may not account for the significant time lags between development of first symptoms, initial detection of pulmonary fibrosis, and referral to an interstitial lung disease (ILD) center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, up to 20 percent of patients with IPF will die from causes not directly attributable to their disease (eg, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Patients with these and other significant comorbidities are often excluded from clinical trials, resulting in lower than expected short-term (eg, one year) mortality rates compared with general clinical cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third, it remains unknown how the introduction of approved IPF medications (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nintedanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nintedanib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pirfenidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pirfenidone</a>) and the decreased use of harmful immunosuppressive agents (ie, combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) will influence long-term survival in patients with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3527193366\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictors of mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In light of the variability in clinical course, several studies have sought to identify predictors of survival in IPF. Predictors of reduced survival at baseline include older age, male sex, lower forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted, lower diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) percent predicted, need for supplemental oxygen, greater severity of dyspnea, lower distance walked on six-minute walk test (6MWT), and greater extent of fibrosis on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), among others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114395\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114395 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/5,8,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,13-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) model</strong> &ndash; The most widely validated clinical prediction model is the GAP model, which incorporates age, gender, FVC, and DLCO into a simple point-score index and staging system predictive of one-, two-, and three-year mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114397 \">table 2</a>) (see online calculator available at <a href=\"http://www.acponline.org/journals/annals/extras/gap/&amp;token=51PKtqdAb/SA0RAD0tuZw2e3tUJaODxCh4Pv7t8Ofd0tRmhQfmx4gqm+bUzODCtZGhHQgyiClB7pKdwBSk/q8Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=113935\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://www.acponline.org/journals/annals/extras/gap/</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In particular, a 10 percent or greater decline in FVC over 6 to 12 months, occurrence of an acute exacerbation, or worsening respiratory symptoms requiring hospitalization all herald high risk for short-term mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular biomarkers</strong> &ndash; Beyond clinically available information, there is great interest in identifying noninvasive molecular biomarkers to refine prognostication in IPF. Some of the most exciting candidates include several blood proteins that reflect alveolar epithelial cell injury or activation of fibrotic pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], peripheral blood gene expression profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and the mucin 5B (MUC5B) promoter polymorphism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114395\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114395 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2996818422\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute exacerbations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute exacerbation of IPF is defined as an acute respiratory deterioration in a patient with IPF along with evidence of new widespread alveolar abnormalities (ie, new bilateral ground glass opacities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consolidation on chest HRCT) not otherwise explained by another cause such as heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute exacerbations occur in approximately 5 to 10 percent of IPF patients per year and carry a very poor prognosis with median survival after an exacerbation of only three to four months and high in-hospital mortality for those presenting with respiratory failure (50 percent overall and 90 percent for those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. More broadly, several studies have confirmed that hospitalizations for worsening respiratory symptoms, regardless of whether they meet criteria for acute exacerbations, confer a high risk for subsequent mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The occurrence of acute exacerbation or respiratory hospitalization should therefore prompt reanalysis of expected prognosis and, potentially, goals of care.

One notable exception is that patients with a family history of pulmonary fibrosis due to mutations in telomere-maintenance genes may have a faster average rate of progression than those with sporadic IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FVC</strong> &ndash; Decline in FVC, as an indirect measure of worsening fibrosis that results in increased lung stiffness, has become the most commonly accepted measure of disease progression in IPF. Data from the placebo groups of multiple IPF trials indicate that the average annual rate of FVC decline is approximately 200 mL, which is approximately halved by both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nintedanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nintedanib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pirfenidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pirfenidone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/3,9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,26</a>]. Rate of decline in FVC among individuals again is highly variable, with approximately one-third each in placebo arms experiencing stability, marginal decline (ie, 5 to 10 percent), or significant decline (ie, &gt;10 percent) in FVC over one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Interestingly, decline in FVC at the individual patient level may be more stepwise than linear over time, and past trajectory of FVC does not predict future trajectory of FVC in the short-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Reduction in FVC decline was the primary efficacy end-point in the landmark trials that led to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nintedanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nintedanib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pirfenidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pirfenidone</a> for IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DLCO</strong> &ndash; DLCO is limited as a practical measure of progression over time due to its lower inter-test reproducibility and relative non-specificity for ILD, but large declines (ie, 15 percent or greater) have been considered an indication of significant progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Smaller declines in DLCO (ie, 5 to 15 percent) may be clinically meaningful when contextualized with other measures of disease progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HRCT</strong> &ndash; Quantification of lung fibrosis on HRCT over time is an attractive and potentially more direct measure of disease progression than FVC but is not currently applicable to clinical practice due to lack of rapid and reproducible quantification methods. Automated software algorithms for quantification of HRCT fibrosis may change this in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H789244529\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular biomarkers</strong> &ndash; There is great interest in identifying molecular biomarkers that can predict rate of disease progression and help identify patients who are more or less likely to benefit from IPF medications or who need urgent evaluation for lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/18,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29,30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55137302\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3966446408\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major reasons to monitor patients with IPF are to assess potential disease progression that might prompt a change in therapy and to identify comorbidities and complications that will influence when to initiate or stop antifibrotic therapy, when to initiate or titrate oxygen therapy, when to refer and list for lung transplantation, and when to initiate palliative measures. The management of IPF is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As there are limited data and no clear consensus on how to monitor patients with IPF, most recommendations are based on extrapolated evidence and expert opinion. The specific monitoring strategy is driven by clinical need that is assessed on a case-by-case basis. The type and frequency of monitoring evolves over the course of the disease, with symptom assessment and pulmonary function measurements being the cornerstones of disease monitoring. </p><p>Early in disease, patients are typically monitored at three- to six-month intervals, with more frequent monitoring considered in patients with more advanced or rapidly progressive disease. Specific monitoring is also required by some funding agencies in order to acquire or maintain financial coverage for antifibrotic medication.</p><p>Patients with worsening symptoms, pulmonary function, or chest imaging should have these findings contextualized with results from other domains to determine whether IPF progression is the cause of this worsening. Progression of IPF may prompt additional confirmatory tests, initiation or change in IPF pharmacotherapy, consideration of lung transplantation, or initiation of palliative therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3081323161\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of IPF are dyspnea, reduced exertional capacity, and cough that is nonproductive or minimally productive. These symptoms are present in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis and increase in prevalence and severity during the course of disease. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dyspnea</strong> &ndash; Worsening dyspnea is a primary indicator of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>], including acute exacerbations of IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and should be assessed at every patient encounter. The optimal method of assessment has not been determined, but in clinical practice dyspnea is typically assessed by a qualitative history or simple measurements such as the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) breathlessness scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Structured dyspnea questionnaires that provide a summary score (eg, University of San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire) have been frequently used in IPF clinical trials; however, the clinical utility of these more detailed and time consuming assessments is unclear and most questionnaires lack complete validation in IPF. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dyspnea is also a common manifestation of multiple comorbidities in IPF (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, cardiovascular disease), and it is necessary to consider worsening dyspnea in the context of other measures of disease progression. This allows determination of whether worsening dyspnea is due to IPF progression, thus informing management decisions related to IPF pharmacotherapy, lung transplantation, and palliative therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise capacity</strong> &ndash; Exercise capacity worsens as IPF progresses and is a major source of morbidity and loss of independence. There is no established strategy for measurement of physical function in IPF, with possibilities including patient history, standardized questionnaires, and direct measurements of exercise performance or physical activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should be questioned about their exercise capacity at each clinical encounter. These questions focus on what distance patients can walk and whether they can climb stairs, with or without oxygen, as well as other questions related to how well the patient is managing in his or her home environment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cough</strong> &ndash; Cough adversely affects quality of life in patients with IPF and tends to worsen as the disease progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The best method of assessment for individual patients has not been determined; in our practice we use a qualitative assessment of frequency and severity. Research studies have assessed cough by using a visual analog scale (eg, marking an &quot;x&quot; on a 10 cm straight line), cough counters, structured questionnaires (eg, Leicester Cough Questionnaire), and as a dichotomous variable based on patient report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

The 6MWT is a well-described standardized test that has been extensively studied in chronic lung diseases, including IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The key variables obtained from the 6MWT are the distance walked and extent of hypoxemia measured by pulse oximetry. A change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) of approximately 30 meters is considered a clinically important change in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]; however, it is unknown what amount of change in oxygenation is clinically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both baseline and change in 6MWD over six months are strong and independent predictors of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/52,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55,56</a>].

Another study monitored 25 patients with daily home spirometry and questionnaires.

These devices can provide useful data on the extent of hypoxemia with a patient's usual amount of physical activity, but may be less reliable than regularly calibrated in-hospital devices. Low readings can be helpful to indicate the need for a formal oxygen needs assessment through a pulmonary function laboratory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overnight oximetry</strong> &ndash; Overnight oximetry is obtained in patients with clinical suspicion of nocturnal hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleep-disordered breathing (eg, due to poor sleep quality, morning headaches, daytime sleepiness, snoring). Given the absence of clear guidance on how frequently patients should be assessed, most patients are tested at baseline and when there is evidence of worsening disease with concern of nocturnal hypoxemia. As described below, the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with IPF indicates the need to consider overnight oximetry and polysomnography in all IPF patients even when there is a low suspicion for nocturnal hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"#H1223865962\" class=\"local\">'Complications and comorbidities'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arterial blood gas</strong> &ndash; An arterial blood gas is obtained in some patients as a complementary study to pulse oximetry in patients with borderline findings; however, this is a more invasive test and is often not necessary to demonstrate the presence of clinically significant hypoxemia.

In contrast, conventional chest radiography has a limited role for routine monitoring of disease progression in patients with IPF, but can be useful as an initial screen for potential etiologies of acute respiratory worsening and can occasionally suggest other comorbidities.</p><p>HRCT with or without a rule-out pulmonary embolism protocol is an important test in the evaluation of an acute respiratory worsening (eg, acute exacerbation of IPF). Given the baseline abnormalities in IPF, comparison of HRCT findings during an episode of acute worsening of dyspnea with a previous exam is essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The role of HRCT for monitoring IPF progression is less clear. In clinical practice, HRCTs are primarily assessed qualitatively to confirm or exclude significant disease progression, particularly in patients with discordant symptoms and physiology. Many clinicians, including ourselves, repeat the HRCT every one to two years in patients with IPF, with the primary goals of identifying any change in morphology, clarifying disease progression, or detecting a new comorbidity (eg, lung malignancy).</p><p>In addition to qualitative assessment, fibrosis severity on HRCT can be scored visually by an experienced chest radiologist to provide a total fibrosis score (ie, percent of affected lung), or quantitatively calculated using a computer-based algorithm to again produce a fibrosis score. Previous studies have shown that both visual and computer-based scoring of fibrosis severity provide prognostic information beyond standard clinical and physiological variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/28,63-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,63-69</a>]; however, these scores have primarily been used as research tools in specialized settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1288856573\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No laboratory studies have been established as having a prognostic role in IPF.
