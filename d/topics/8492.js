Hyper-IgM syndrome includes several genetically determined diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] but may also be secondary to congenital rubella syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, T cell leukemia, or lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic review discusses in detail only genetically determined forms of hyper-IgM syndrome.

The estimated frequency of CD40 ligand (CD40L) deficiency is 2:1,000,000 males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although no data are available on the frequency of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency, this disorder is estimated to affect fewer than 1:1,000,000 individuals. In contrast, there are only a few reported cases of CD40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>] and uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] deficiencies. There is parental consanguinity in several families with autosomal recessive forms of hyper-IgM syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H4462592\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4462584\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maturation of antibody responses is marked by a series of events that include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class-switch recombination (CSR, also called class-switching), whereby the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain is replaced by other heavy chain isotypes with distinct biologic properties, resulting in production of immunoglobulin isotypes other than IgM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic hypermutation (SHM), by which somatic mutations are introduced in the variable region of actively transcribed immunoglobulin genes, thereby allowing production of high-affinity antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generation of memory B cells.</p><p/><p>Costimulatory signals provided by T cells play a critical role during CSR. Activated CD4+ follicular helper T cells express CD40 ligand (CD40L; or CD154) and secrete various cytokines upon antigen recognition. Cytokines released by activated CD4+ T cells bind to cognate receptors expressed on the surface of B cells and prompt CSR to specific immunoglobulin isotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. CD40L binds CD40 that is constitutively expressed by B cells. CD40 ligation in B cells promotes activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) molecules and the nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-&kappa;B) signaling pathway, allowing expression of NF-&kappa;B-dependent genes, such as the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (<em>AICDA</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] are two enzymes involved in CSR. Mismatched repair (MMR) proteins, including the post-meiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2) protein, are also involved in the process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>AID also initiates SHM, with deamination of cytidine residues in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>All forms of hyper-IgM syndrome are characterized by defective CSR. Impaired CSR in hyper-IgM syndromes is due to intrinsic B cell abnormalities or defects that involve several types of immune cells. This difference in the pathogenesis accounts for the distinctive clinical features in the various forms of hyper-IgM syndrome. Most forms of hyper-IgM also have impairment of SHM, with production of low-affinity antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F86094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86094 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>In particular, <em>CD40LG</em> (encoding for CD40L) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>] and <em>CD40</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] mutations affect the interaction between activated CD4+ T cells and cell types expressing CD40 (B cells, dendritic cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophages,</span> platelets, activated endothelial and epithelial cells). Thus, impairment of CSR in these disorders is part of a broader spectrum of immunologic abnormalities that also includes defective T cell priming and impaired antigen-specific T cell responses, resulting in a combined immunodeficiency phenotype. In contrast, <em>AICDA</em> (encoding for AID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and <em>UNG</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] mutations uniquely affect B cell function and hence represent the prototypes of intrinsic B cell abnormalities of CSR. AID plays a role in B cell tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. CD40L deficiency is also known as HIGM1, AID deficiency as HIGM2, CD40 deficiency as HIGM3, and UNG deficiency as HIGM5. No specific molecular defect has been identified yet in HIGM4. Finally, a hyper-IgM phenotype may also be seen in other, more complex immunodeficiencies, such as activated PI3-kinase delta syndrome type 1 (APDS1, due to activating mutations of the <em>PIK3CD</em> gene) and type 2 (APDS2, due to mutations of the <em>PIK3R1</em> gene). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies#H24580444\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Activated PI3K-delta syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Mutations of the <em>IKBKG</em> gene (encoding for <span class=\"nowrap\">IKK-&gamma;/NF-&kappa;B</span> essential modifier [NEMO], a regulatory component of the NF-&kappa;B signaling pathway) affect the NF-&kappa;B signaling pathway in a variety of cell types and are responsible for X-linked ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (XL-EDA-ID), whose phenotype may also include impaired CSR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Defective CSR also occurs in patients with deficiency of PMS2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], a disorder characterized by an increased risk of malignancies in childhood. Finally, CSR is defective in other diseases associated with impairment of DNA repair, such as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In some cases, patients with these diseases may show immunoglobulin abnormalities similar to those seen with hyper-IgM syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H25649353\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'IKK complex and NFKBIA (IKBA) deficiencies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ataxia-telangiectasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ataxia-telangiectasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nijmegen-breakage-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nijmegen breakage syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4462592\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A list of gene defects that cause hyper-IgM syndrome is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F86094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86094 \">table 1</a>). The most common form of hyper-IgM syndrome is inherited as an X-linked trait and is due to mutations of the <em>CD40LG</em> gene, also known as <em>TNFSF5</em>, which encodes CD40 ligand (CD40L). Carrier females of X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (also known as hyper-IgM syndrome type 1 [HIGM1], MIM #308230) are clinically healthy. Exceptional occurrence of the disease has been observed in females as a result of extreme lyonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms#H832339165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;, section on 'X-inactivation'</a>) that may be the consequence of chromosomal translocation involving the <em>CD40LG</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency (also known as HIGM2, MIM #605258) is the second most common form of hyper-IgM syndrome and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. However, autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported in four families with a nonsense mutation in the <em>ACIDA</em> gene that affected the C-terminus of the AID protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) deficiency (MIM #608106) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and CD40 deficiency (HIGM3, MIM #606843) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] also have autosomal recessive inheritance.</p><p>In addition to these genetically defined forms, there is one variant of defective class-switch recombination (CSR) downstream from switch (S) region DNA cleavage (also known as HIGM4, MIM 608184) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] whose molecular basis remains unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4462608\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical phenotype of hyper-IgM syndrome varies depending upon the nature of the genetic defect. CD40 ligand (CD40L) and CD40 deficiencies are combined immunodeficiencies, whereas activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) deficiencies are humoral immunodeficiencies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-humoral-immunodeficiencies-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary humoral immunodeficiencies: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4468219\"><span class=\"h2\">CD40 ligand (CD40L) or CD40 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CD40L deficiency, which is inherited as an X-linked trait, is the most common form of hyper-IgM syndrome. Patients with CD40L or CD40 deficiency share similar features because these disorders affect the interaction between activated CD4+ T cells expressing CD40L and cell types expressing CD40 (B cells, dendritic cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages,</span> platelets, and activated endothelial and epithelial cells). Here, we will refer to reports pertaining to CD40L-deficient patients because only a few CD40-deficient patients have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/6,7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,31</a>].</p><p>CD40L deficiency often presents in infancy with increased susceptibility to recurrent sinopulmonary infections (eg, pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media), primarily caused by encapsulated bacteria (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/5,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,32,33</a>]. In addition, opportunistic infections, particularly with <em>Pneumocystis</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Histoplasma</em> organisms, are common and may occur in the first few months of life. <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia, for example, is reported in approximately 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/5,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,32</a>] and may represent the first clinical finding.</p><p>Chronic or protracted diarrhea occurs in one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/5,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,32,33</a>], often beginning in infancy or early childhood, and may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with the parasite <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em> is common and is associated with an increased risk of biliary tract disease. <em>C. parvum</em> infection was reported in 21 and 60 percent of CD40L-deficient patients who developed chronic diarrhea in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], respectively. Sclerosing cholangitis may occur at any age and was reported in 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] percent of patients in the United States and European series, respectively. The different frequency of <em>C. parvum</em> infection and biliary tract disease in these series may reflect differences in the levels of <em>Cryptosporidium</em> oocysts in water supplies in these regions.</p><p>Liver disease in patients with CD40L deficiency may also be secondary to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma represent two frequent complications of <em>Cryptosporidium</em> and CMV infection in patients with CD40L deficiency and may occur at any age, including childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Children and adults with CD40L deficiency are at higher risk for <em>Cryptococcus</em> and <em>Toxoplasma</em> infections that may affect the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36,37</a>].

In newborns and infants younger than six months of age, the diagnosis of CD40L deficiency is primarily based upon genetic testing since reduced ability to express CD40L can occur in CD4+ lymphocytes from patients in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Confirmation of diagnosis in older children is based upon demonstration of impaired expression of CD40L on the surface of CD4+ T cells upon in vitro<em> </em>activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/5,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,56</a>]. Typically, this is achieved by activating peripheral blood mononuclear cells overnight with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, followed by staining for CD40L using anti-CD40L monoclonal antibodies and gating on CD8-negative cells.

This is important when considering other conditions in the differential diagnosis, such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) (see <a href=\"#H25649353\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). In addition, gating on CD8-negative cells is preferred over gating on CD4+ lymphocytes when assessing CD40L expression on activated lymphocytes because downregulation of CD4 expression that is typically observed upon in vitro activation might otherwise confound interpretation of the results.</p><p>In most cases, use of anti-CD40L monoclonal antibodies readily allows identification of CD40L-deficient patients.

Thus, patients whose clinical and immunologic phenotype is strongly suggestive for CD40L deficiency, but in whom staining with anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody is normal, should be analyzed by flow cytometry using biotinylated CD40-Ig chimeric construct (followed by reaction with fluorochrome-labeled streptavidin) or monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD40-binding epitope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Survival probability after HCT was approximately 80 percent at 20 years but was significantly better (close to 90 percent) for patients who had received transplant in more recent years (1993 to 2013) than in earlier years (1964 to 1992).</p><p>Age less than five years at the time of HCT was also associated with improved survival in this series, whereas liver disease at the time of transplantation was associated with poorer outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Forty percent of the patients developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), mostly acute. Infections and transplant-related complications (veno-occlusive disease and GVHD) were the main causes of death, and most deaths occurred within the first year after HCT. While no difference in overall survival was reported in patients treated with or without HCT, survivors treated with HCT had higher median Karnofsky-Lansky scores that measure functional status.</p><p>Reactivation of <em>Cryptosporidium</em> infection, even when subclinical, may occur after HCT and may lead to disseminated infection and death in patients with CD40L or CD40 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. For this reason, active surveillance against <em>Cryptosporidium </em>infection should be performed periodically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on stool samples.

Increased secretion of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines upon in vitro activation of mononuclear cells and in vivo acquisition of the capacity to mount delayed-type hypersensitivity were demonstrated, although the latter effect ceased after recombinant human CD40L (rhCD40L) was discontinued. No variations in immunoglobulin levels and specific antibody responses were noted. Treatment with rhCD40L might be a valid treatment option for CD40L-deficient patients with biliary <em>Cryptosporidium</em> disease in light of the lack of effective treatment for patients with active <em>Cryptosporidium</em> infection and of improved T cell function following administration of hrCD40L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18934075\"><span class=\"h2\">AID and UNG deficiencies and HIGM4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hyper-IgM syndrome due to activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) or uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) deficiency is based upon <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy that can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.

(See <a href=\"#H4462576\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All genetically determined forms of hyper-IgM syndrome are characterized by defective CSR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F86094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86094 \">table 1</a>). Some forms also have impairment of somatic hypermutation (SHM), with production of low, rather than high, affinity antibodies. Impaired CSR in hyper-IgM syndrome is due to B cell-intrinsic abnormalities or to defects that involve several types of immune cells. This difference in the pathogenesis accounts for the distinctive clinical features in the various forms of hyper-IgM syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H4462584\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD40 ligand (CD40L) deficiency is the most common form of hyper-IgM syndrome. It is inherited as an X-linked trait and is a combined immunodeficiency. This disease affects the interaction between activated CD4+ T cells and cell types expressing CD40 (B cells, dendritic cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophages,</span> platelets, activated endothelial and epithelial cells). The clinical phenotype of CD40L deficiency is marked not only by recurrent sinopulmonary infections but also by opportunistic infections and liver and biliary tract disease. CD40 deficiency affects the interaction of the same cell types as CD40L deficiency and therefore has a similar clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H4462584\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4462592\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4468219\" class=\"local\">'CD40 ligand (CD40L) or CD40 deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency and uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) deficiency account for hyper-IgM syndrome due to a B cell-intrinsic defect of CSR (humoral rather than combined immunodeficiency). These patients suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary infections, enlargement of lymph nodes and tonsils, and are at higher risk for autoimmune manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H4462584\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4462592\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4468226\" class=\"local\">'Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18933964\" class=\"local\">'UNG deficiency and HIGM4'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow cytometry-based analysis of CD40L expression on the surface of in vitro activated CD4+ lymphocytes can facilitate the diagnosis of X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome and can also be used for carrier detection. Ultimately, mutation analysis should be used for definitive confirmation of genetically determined hyper-IgM syndrome. There is one form of hyper-IgM (HIGM4) for which the molecular basis remains unknown. (See <a href=\"#H4462624\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4462592\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of acquired forms of hyper-IgM include congenital rubella syndrome, antiepileptic drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>), and tumors (T cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas). These patients tend to have laboratory findings suggestive of hyper-IgM syndrome, but their clinical manifestations are distinct. (See <a href=\"#H25649353\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hyper-IgM should be managed by an immunology specialist in addition to their primary care provider. Treatment of hyper-IgM syndrome requires regular administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>. Additional measures are used in patients with CD40L and with CD40 deficiency. These include prevention of <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> infection by means of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, hygienic measures to reduce the risk of <em>Cryptosporidium</em> infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F86095\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86095 \">table 2</a>), and regular monitoring of liver function. The only definitive cure for CD40L (or CD40) deficiency is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
