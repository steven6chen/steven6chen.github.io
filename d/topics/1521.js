It is characterized by paradoxical nasal congestion and thick, troublesome nasal secretions and complicated by bacterial colonization and infection. Enlargement of the nasal cavities may occur in some forms. Most patients also have concomitant sinusitis, and thus, the disorder is more accurately called atrophic rhinosinusitis. There are primary and secondary forms of this disorder, which affect different populations and have distinct presentations.</p><p>This topic will discuss the classification, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of atrophic rhinosinusitis. Other forms of chronic rhinosinusitis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18731467\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophic rhinosinusitis may be categorized into two forms: primary (or idiopathic) and secondary.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary form is seen primarily in young people in the developing world. It is associated with mucosal colonization, predominantly with <em>Klebsiella ozaenae</em>, as well as other organisms. The primary presenting symptom is foul-smelling nasal discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary atrophic rhinosinusitis is seen with some regularity in the developed world and occurs in patients who underwent prior sinonasal trauma, surgery, radiation therapy, or have certain inflammatory conditions (granulomatous diseases).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY ATROPHIC RHINOSINUSITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary (idiopathic) atrophic rhinosinusitis is principally reported among patients from lower socioeconomic groups living in geographic areas with warm climates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Areas of high prevalence include southern Saudi Arabia, China, Africa, India, the Mediterranean, and the Philippines. It is uncommon in the United States and Europe, although it should be considered in immigrants from these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The low incidence in developed countries has been suggested to be at least in part due to widespread availability of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By definition, there is no history of nasal trauma or surgery, granulomatous disease, or sinonasal radiation prior to the onset of symptoms.</p><p>Women are affected more often than men, and younger people are affected more often than older adults. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. In one study of 100 cases from China, 86 patients were less than 30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with primary atrophic rhinosinusitis present with halitosis, which is noticeable to others. The patients themselves can also perceive a constant bad odor (cacosmia). This is the origin of the term &quot;ozena&quot; (&quot;the stench&quot;), which is sometimes used as a synonym for severe primary atrophic rhinosinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, this unfortunate descriptor both stigmatizes and embarrasses affected patients and should be avoided. Other symptoms include anosmia, epistaxis, nasal pain, sleep disruption, and choking from aspiration of crusts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>].</p><p>In a Thai series of 47 patients with primary atrophic rhinosinusitis, the most common presenting symptoms were nasal crusts (54 percent), purulent discharge (43 percent), foul smell (41 percent), and nasal obstruction (37 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Patients may report congestion, even those with abnormally enlarged nasal cavities, because the sensation of obstruction can arise from abnormal airflow through the nose or a lack of sensation of airflow due to the loss of tissue containing sensory receptors. The same phenomenon is seen in patients with nasal septal perforation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal exam reveals a shiny, thin, pale, and sometimes ulcerated mucosa covered by thick yellow, brown, or green crusts, which may be bloody or covered with purulence. Resorption of underlying bone leads to enlargement of the nasal cavities and bowing of the lateral nasal wall in some cases. Nasal septal perforation and secondary saddle nose deformity may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3730026\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factors that predispose certain individuals to develop primary atrophic rhinosinusitis are not definitively known, although various developmental, endocrine, vascular, nutritional, anatomic, infectious, and autoimmune factors have been postulated to be relevant. In the Thai study, many patients either came from rural areas or worked in factories, suggesting that specific environmental exposures may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A genetic association was suggested in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Histologically, the disease is characterized by replacement of the normal pseudostratified columnar epithelium with a metaplastic, predominantly squamous epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>].

These patients have stagnant mucus that is superinfected, rather than a traditional sinusitis. Antibiotics do not resolve this condition and often make it worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with the dry form of secondary atrophic rhinosinusitis have dry noses with bloody scabs.

Of note, chronic nasal obstruction was common but not specific to patients with atrophic rhinosinusitis, so this was excluded as a criterion. The six criteria listed above occurred more often in patients with atrophic rhinosinusitis compared with other forms of rhinosinusitis.</p><p>In addition to the standard history and physical examination, we perform rhinoscopy with a nasal endoscope after spraying the nose with a topical <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthetic/decongestant</span>. Although the findings may be detectable with a simple nasal speculum exam in some cases, nasal endoscopy allows for a more complete appreciation of the extent of disease and is essential in subsequent management. Nasal endoscopy is usually performed by an otolaryngologist or by an allergist with specific training in this procedure.</p><p>Nasal cultures positive for coliforms are supportive of the diagnosis, although these are not routinely performed or used to guide therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560424\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is the recommended imaging methodology for evaluation of patients with symptoms consistent with atrophic rhinosinusitis (if not already performed).

Our approach to management of atrophic rhinosinusitis is empiric and is described in detail in the following section. Daily therapy includes nasal lavage and lubrication. Topical antibiotics are added when indicated. Any underlying active disease process, such as sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), must be treated if present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal lavage and lubrication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal lavage is recommended to prevent formation of crusts and drying of the atrophic nasal lining. It is associated with improvement in a variety of rhinitis conditions and carries little risk if properly performed, although it has not been specifically studied in the treatment of atrophic rhinosinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Patients with atrophic rhinosinusitis are encouraged to lavage their noses with warmed isotonic saline at least twice daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78832 \">table 2</a>). We recommend using an oral irrigating device (eg, Waterpik or similar product) with a tip for nasal irrigation (eg, Grossan tip or similar product). Other devices, such as bulb syringes, bottle sprayers, and nebulizers are also effective, provided the system delivers an adequate volume of solution (&gt;200 mL per side) into the nose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>After lavage, we use one of several agents to lubricate the mucosa. Acceptable products include petroleum jelly or personal lubricants. Xylitol-containing saline sprays may be useful when applied regularly to the nasal cavity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few data exist concerning the efficacy of antibiotics added to lavage solutions in atrophic rhinosinusitis. However, case reports and small series of patients with recalcitrant rhinitis from various etiologies have found the intervention helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Theoretically, lavage with antibiotic solutions provides relatively high concentrations of drug directly to the nasal cavity, which is the site of the pathology in atrophic rhinosinusitis, in contrast to chronic rhinosinusitis, in which the pathology involves the sinuses more than the nasal passages.</p><p>It has been our experience that this intervention is helpful. An antibiotic may be added to the lavage when the nasal wash or nasal discharge becomes persistently purulent for more than two days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55661 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> initially. Quinolone or aminoglycoside rinses are used when gram-negative organisms are suspected. The antibiotic solution is used twice daily until the patient no longer notes purulent nasal discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> purulence clears from the lavage solution.</p><p>The oral administration of antibiotics may also be required for acute infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. We generally use broad-spectrum antibiotics for patients with secondary disease, although there are no specific studies examining choice of antibiotics in this situation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> has been studied in a small number of patients with the primary form of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

We advise patients to avoid these.</p><p>A number of surgical procedures have been proposed. However, controlled trials have not been performed to adequately assess their efficacy. Procedures include temporary closure of the nostrils to facilitate regrowth of the nasal epithelium (Young's operation), surgical implantation of acrylic, Teflon, silastic, or polyethylene materials to decrease the nasal volume, flap procedures, injection of allogeneic bone or fat, and injection of placental tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrophic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>].

This should be performed by an otolaryngologist or other clinician trained in nasal endoscopy, as excessive bleeding may result if the procedure is improperly done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3730256\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, atrophic rhinosinusitis is a lifelong condition. However, in our experience, the secondary form of the disease seems to &quot;burn out&quot; spontaneously in a subset of patients. That is, the wet form sometimes transforms into the dry form. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Secondary atrophic rhinosinusitis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1376811139\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rinsing-out-your-nose-with-salt-water-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Rinsing out your nose with salt water (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrophic rhinosinusitis is a syndrome of progressive atrophy and bacterial colonization of the nasal mucosa. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary (idiopathic) atrophic rhinosinusitis is the more severe form of the condition and is predominantly seen in developing countries. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Primary atrophic rhinosinusitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The secondary form, which is associated with nasal surgery, trauma, radiation, and granulomatous diseases is more common in developed countries. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Secondary atrophic rhinosinusitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms include chronic nasal congestion, crusting of nasal secretions, halitosis, anosmia, epistaxis, sleep disruption, and depression. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal endoscopy reveals a thin, erythematous mucosa, with nasal bleeding, crusting, and purulence. The nasal cavities may become enlarged, particularly in the primary form. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Nasal exam'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nasal exam findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of atrophic rhinosinusitis (either primary or secondary) is based upon the combination of suggestive symptoms, endoscopic findings, and radiographic results. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The possibility of an underlying and causative disease should be investigated in patients with apparent systemic illness. (See <a href=\"#H2375605219\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no controlled trials comparing therapies for atrophic rhinosinusitis. If secondary atrophic rhinosinusitis is due to an underlying active disease process, then therapy should focus on the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest nasal lavage with warmed normal saline at least twice daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78832 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). After lavage, we suggest that patients lubricate the cleaned nasal mucosa with petroleum jelly, xylitol-containing saline sprays, or personal lubricants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Nasal lavage and lubrication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that an antibiotic be added to the lavage solution when the nasal wash or nasal discharge becomes purulent for more than two days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55661 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is continued until the purulence clears. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral antibiotics are used for acute bacterial sinus infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment#H17857080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest performing rhinoscopy at least twice yearly to remove synechiae and crusts as long as symptoms persist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20790815\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>against</strong> the routine use of the various surgical interventions that appear in the literature (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
