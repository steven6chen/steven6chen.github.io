More than five million central venous catheters are inserted in the United States each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Central venous access is also needed to place pulmonary artery catheters, plasmapheresis and hemodialysis catheters, as well as to place inferior vena cava filters, introduce wires for transvenous pacing and defibrillator devices, and for venous interventions. The central venous access site and manner in which access is achieved depend upon the indication for placement, patient anatomy, and other patient-related factors.</p><p>The indications for central venous access, types of central catheters, catheter selection, site selection, and general issues of preparation and placement will be reviewed here. The role of catheters and devices for monitoring cardiac parameters, or administering chemotherapy or parenteral nutrition is discussed in separate topic reviews. </p><p>The placement of jugular, subclavian, and femoral catheters; issues specific to these anatomic sites; routine maintenance and care of catheters and port devices; and complications of central venous catheters and related devices are discussed elsewhere.

Cannulation is generally avoided at sites with anatomic distortion or other indwelling intravascular hardware, such as a pacemaker or hemodialysis catheter. Vascular injury proximal to the insertion site represents another relative contraindication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177530472\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulopathy and/or thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate-to-severe coagulopathy is a relative contraindication to central venous catheterization, although major bleeding is uncommon. A systematic review of central line placement in coagulopathic patients documented a bleeding incidence of 0 to 32 percent, with major bleeding complicating 0.8 percent. Importantly, the risk of bleeding was <strong>not</strong> predicted by the severity of the coagulopathy, and there was no demonstrable benefit of prophylactic blood product administration prior to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The need for urgent and emergency venous access may require cannulation in spite of coagulopathy, and the safety of standard nontunneled and large-bore tunneled catheter placement in this circumstance has been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. The platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) thresholds for which central venous catheterization can safely be performed remain unclear. Thrombocytopenia appears to pose a greater risk compared with prolonged clotting times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Retrospective studies suggest that no preprocedure reversal is warranted for platelet count &gt;20 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> and INR &lt;3.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>In general, nontunneled catheterization at sites that are easy to monitor for bleeding are preferred in patients with coagulopathy. The subclavian approach is often avoided due to inability to effectively monitor or compress the venipuncture site, unless an alternative site is not suitable. Ultrasound guidance decreases the number of attempts required for successful cannulation and reduces complication rates, including bleeding. Whenever available, cannulation should be performed by an experienced provider using ultrasound guidance for patients with coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H177533298\" class=\"local\">'Use of ultrasound'</a> below.). </p><p>In spite of common concern and practice, there is limited evidence supporting routine correction of coagulopathy prior to central venous cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/6,11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,15,16</a>]. We advocate consideration of administration of a preprocedure blood product (eg, platelets, fresh frozen plasma [FFP], plasma frozen within 24 hours [PF24], prothrombin complex concentrate) for severe coagulopathy (eg, platelet count &lt;20 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> and INR &gt;3.0) when time allows, and based on the clinical decision that the benefit of preprocedure replacement outweighs the risk. Indications for correcting coagulopathy in patients undergoing invasive procedures and dosing are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H558384448\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Preparation for an invasive procedure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H4301125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Overview of indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103752\"><span class=\"h1\">CENTRAL CATHETERS AND DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central venous catheters can be inserted percutaneously or surgically. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103759\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontunneled</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontunneled central catheters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F95494\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95494 \">figure 1</a>) are placed percutaneously with the catheter exiting the skin in the vicinity of the venous cannulation site. These catheters are most commonly used for temporary access to the central circulation. Catheters are available in a variety of lengths (15 to 30 cm) and catheter materials (eg, polyurethane, silicone). Specialized catheters for longer-term infusion may contain a valve mechanism to limit backflow of blood for the purpose of preventing infection and catheter thrombosis. Power injectable catheters for administration of intravenous contrast are also available.</p><p>Nontunneled central catheters may be single, double, triple, or quadruple lumen. The different lumens infuse fluid through holes located on the side of the catheter. The distal hole is more reliable for drawing blood because it is less likely to be suctioned against the wall of the vein during aspiration. As the number of lumens increase, the overall diameter of the catheter increases, and the diameter of the individual luminal channels generally decreases. The use of multilumen catheters reduces the maximum infusion rate of the catheter and increases the rate of catheter thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H165302905\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Catheter-related factors'</a>.)</p><p>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are another type of commonly used central access device. These devices are gaining in popularity due to the relative ease of insertion into the upper arm veins (cephalic or basilic veins) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55596 \">figure 2</a>), a lower risk of some complications, and patient tolerance. Single and double lumen PICCs and valved devices are available. PICCs are less favored in patients with significant renal dysfunction due to the risk of venous thrombosis or stenosis that could complicate long-term access options for hemodialysis; however, the incidence of this potential complication is not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. As with centrally-inserted catheters, the rate of venous thrombosis for PICCs increases with increasing number of lumens and catheter diameter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H165302905\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Catheter-related factors'</a>.)</p><p>Antibiotic and antiseptic-impregnated central catheters are available, and may decrease rates of bacterial colonization and catheter-related infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H1923683666\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92058941\"><span class=\"h2\">Introducer sheath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An introducer sheath (eg, Cordis) is a special type of venous access catheter that is single-lumen, but with a larger bore (8.5 F) and shorter length than standard central catheters. The proximal end of these devices contains a hemostatic valve through which other devices are introduced into the venous circulation (eg, pulmonary artery catheter). However, the device can be used alone for rapid fluid infusion due to the large luminal diameter. (See <a href=\"#H3103773\" class=\"local\">'Specialized venous devices'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103766\"><span class=\"h2\">Implanted</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implanted catheters are meant to be semipermanent with removal reserved if complications occur or the device is no longer needed (eg, completion of chemotherapy). Two types of implanted central venous catheters are available: tunneled catheters and totally implantable venous access devices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F95494\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95494 \">figure 1</a>). Power injectable tunneled catheters and port devices are available. PICCs may also be attached to an implanted port device. They are typically used for shorter duration than most implanted catheters, such as for prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362076169\"><span class=\"h3\">Tunneled</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tunneled central venous catheters traverse a subcutaneous tunnel between the catheterized vein and the skin exit site. The catheter may be round or flat and catheter sizes can range from 2.7 to 12.5 F (eg, Hickman, Broviac). A cuff (velour, Dacron) is positioned in the subcutaneous tissue adjacent the exit site. In general, rates of infection associated with tunneled catheters are lower than those reported with the use of nontunneled central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Dialysis and pheresis catheters are specialized large-bore double lumen catheters designed for the exchange of large volumes of blood at high flow rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Determinants of infection risk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79680952\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Dialysis catheters'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362076162\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcutaneous port</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) have been used widely since their introduction in the 1980s (eg, Port-a-Cath, BardPort, PowerPort, Infuse-a-Port, Medi-port) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. The catheter of these devices is passed from the cannulated vein beneath the skin and attached to a subcutaneous infusion port or reservoir that is placed into a subcutaneous pocket. PICC devices can also be attached to a subcutaneous port (eg, Passport). </p><p>The port or reservoir is accessed through the skin by needle puncture into the port's self-sealing septum. Single and dual port devices are available. The main factor limiting infusion rate with these devices is the bore of the access needle (eg, Huber, 19 [0.053&quot; = 1.33 mm diameter] to 22 gauge [0.045&quot; = 1.2 mm diameter]), which is nearly always smaller than the internal diameter of the catheter attached to the port. Subcutaneous ports are commonly used to administer chemotherapy agents because of their low rates of extravasation and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Subcutaneous ports also have the advantage of concealment from view, making this option more cosmetically appealing. Magnetic resonance compatible devices are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103773\"><span class=\"h2\">Specialized venous devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several medical devices require central venous access for placement. These devices are typically deployed through an introducer sheath. (See <a href=\"#H3103759\" class=\"local\">'Nontunneled'</a> above and <a href=\"#H92058941\" class=\"local\">'Introducer sheath'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vena cava filters &ndash; Vena cava filters are indicated to decrease the risk of fatal pulmonary embolism in selected patients with deep vein thrombosis. Central venous access is obtained through the internal jugular or femoral vein and a long sheath facilitates device introduction under fluoroscopy or ultrasound-guidance. The placement of inferior vena cava filters and their complications are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-vena-cava-filters-and-their-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of vena cava filters and their complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary artery catheters &ndash; Pulmonary artery catheters are inserted through a venous sheath and the tip of the catheter is positioned in the pulmonary artery as a means to monitor on cardiac function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54333\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54333 \">figure 3</a>). Insertion of pulmonary artery catheters is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheters: Insertion technique in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Pacemakers/Defibrillators</span> &ndash; The placement of <span class=\"nowrap\">pacemaker/defibrillator</span> leads also requires central venous access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67053 \">figure 4</a>). After the vein is accessed, a sheath is introduced through which the pacemaker leads are introduced and positioned into the heart. The leads are attached to the pacemaker, which is placed into a subcutaneous pocket similar to other subcutaneous port devices (see <a href=\"#H362076162\" class=\"local\">'Subcutaneous port'</a> above). Issues related to cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporary-cardiac-pacing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporary cardiac pacing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103780\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of central venous catheters and devices are available. Device selection depends primarily upon the indication for access but patient anatomy and other patient-related factors may also have a bearing. </p><p>The choice between temporary (nontunneled) versus permanent (tunneled, port) placement, depends upon the indication for central access. Patients who require access for only a short period of time (days) need not be exposed to the discomfort or risks associated with tunneled devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients requiring long-term access (weeks, permanent) benefit from tunneled or port devices, which are associated with lower rates of catheter infection compared with nontunneled catheters. Selected patients may benefit from antibiotic-coated catheters based upon infectious risk, cost, and anticipated duration of the catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Type of catheter'</a>.)</p><p>A single lumen, large-bore introducer sheath facilitates rapid administration of large volumes of fluid during emergencies. For less emergent fluid resuscitation, a nontunneled central line is preferred over peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC), which do not provide adequate flow rates due to their small caliber and longer catheter length. </p><p>Multiple lumen catheters are used more often than single lumen catheters, primarily because of the need to administer multiple pharmaceutical agents. In general, the smallest diameter catheter (fewer lumens) appropriate for the clinical situation should be used to reduce the risk of venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Compared with port devices, tunneled catheters have some disadvantages. Tunneled catheters may have higher infection rates related to care of the external catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.). </p><p>In addition, activities such as showering or swimming with tunneled catheters are limited. Because subcutaneous ports allow more normal activities and cannot be seen (and thus are not an external reminder of the patient's illness), ports are often preferred when intermittent infusion therapy (eg, chemotherapy) is needed. The disadvantages of subcutaneous port devices are the need to puncture the port through the skin to access the device and the small caliber of the catheter, and thus, limited infusion rate. Port devices are not appropriate for patients who require frequent dosing or continuous infusion of larger fluid volumes such as with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103787\"><span class=\"h1\">SITE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selection of the most appropriate site for central venous cannulation is based upon the expertise and skill of the operator, patient anatomy (eg, known venous occlusion, presence of lymphedema), the risks associated with placement (eg, coagulopathy, pulmonary disease), and access needs (eg, patient needs and duration of catheter use) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. Although it is tempting to always use the same approach, knowledge of access techniques at multiple access sites is important to meet varying patient needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Higher success rates and lower rates of mechanical complications are clearly related to operator experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. </p><p>Commonly used vein cannulation sites for central venous access include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jugular vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>External jugular vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Internal jugular vein (central, posterior, anterior approaches)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclavian vein (supraclavicular, infraclavicular, axillary approaches)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral vein</p><p/><p>Specific techniques for placement of central venous catheters at these sites are discussed elsewhere.

Access sites with altered local anatomy (eg, prior clavicle fracture), sites with multiple scars from prior access, and the presence of another central venous catheter or device (such as a pacemaker or internal defibrillator) are associated with higher rates of access failure, malposition, dysrhythmia, and other complications, and should be avoided if alternative sites are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/13,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,36,37</a>]. If a patient has significant unilateral lung disease, the hemithorax ipsilateral to the disease should be cannulated (internal jugular, subclavian access) to minimize respiratory decompensation in the event of a procedure-related pneumothorax. Subclavian venous access for hemodialysis catheters is avoided due to the risk of venous stenosis complicating subsequent hemodialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79682271\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Basic principles'</a>.)</p><p>Right subclavian anatomy carries the theoretical advantage of lower pneumothorax risk due to the lower pleural apex and absence of the thoracic duct. However, this access site is associated with higher rates of catheter malposition and vessel trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, for implanted port access, a trial did not find a significant difference in the rate of thrombotic or occlusion events for right-sided versus left-sided access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382365678\"><span class=\"h2\">Subclavian versus internal jugular access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematic reviews show minor variations in complications between the subclavian and internal jugular access sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/1,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40-42</a>]. Subclavian access is associated with a lower risk for infection but a higher rate of insertion failure. The rate of overall mechanical complications appears similar.</p><p>A 2012 meta-analysis suggested that nontunneled subclavian access is associated with lower risk of catheter-related infection compared with alternative sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A later multicenter trial focusing on intravascular complications of nontunneled central catheters in intensive care unit patients found a lower composite risk of bloodstream infection and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis for subclavian compared with jugular vein catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A later meta-analysis that included this trial, two other trials, and six observational studies found no difference in the rate of surgical site infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. For implantable port access for cancer therapy, a trial comparing the internal jugular with subclavian site also found no significant difference in infection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Anatomic location'</a>.)</p><p>In the multicenter trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], subclavian access was associated with a higher rate of insertion failure and had a higher rate of pneumothorax (1.5 versus 0.5 percent), but overall, there was no difference in major (grade &ge;3) mechanical complications between these sites (2.1 versus 1.4 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.1). Although not mandated, nearly two-thirds of jugular access procedures were facilitated under ultrasound guidance, and this was not associated with reduced mechanical complications.</p><p>For patients who are cachectic or have respiratory compromise, a jugular approach may be preferred to avoid pneumothorax. The subclavian site may be preferentially avoided in patients with severe coagulopathy unless alternative sites are suboptimal. Although arterial puncture may occur more frequently with the jugular approach, recognition of bleeding and its control are easier at this site. (See <a href=\"#H177530472\" class=\"local\">'Coagulopathy and/or thrombocytopenia'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382365406\"><span class=\"h2\">Femoral access versus other sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally favor nonfemoral access points due to ease of care and ability to permit ambulation, in the absence of clinical factors such as emergency situations, respiratory distress, uncooperative patient, absence of another alternative site, and when the operator is sufficiently experienced with nonfemoral central venous access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Warnings to avoid femoral cannulation have focused on higher risks of infectious and thrombotic complications compared with torso access sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/34,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,45,46</a>]. However, a systematic review found no difference in the rate of nontunneled-catheter-related bloodstream infection when comparing femoral, subclavian, and jugular sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Contemporary trials examining femoral access sites show decreasing rates of infection that are comparable with jugular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/43,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47</a>]. These rates parallel an overall reduction in catheter-related bloodstream infection, which is a testament to the impact of improved adherence to aseptic technique and proper catheter management. Higher body mass index was a factor associated with nontunneled-catheter-related infection at the femoral site in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a larger trial, the composite outcome of bloodstream infection and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis was significantly greater for the femoral compared with the subclavian site (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-7.8), but similar to the internal jugular site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Femoral access was associated with the fewest mechanical complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353974\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral versus central vein insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have gained popularity for ease of insertion and lesser procedural risk (eg, hemo- or pneumothorax). Typically, PICCs are placed by intravenous (IV) nurses and are most commonly used for temporary access needs (expected infusion &gt;15 days to 30 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], such as outpatient IV antibiotic administration. </p><p>Catheter placement is often performed with the assistance of ultrasound to access the peripheral vein. Once accessed, a catheter is placed over a guidewire and positioned in the central veins. The initial catheter length is based on estimates using anatomic landmarks. Position is confirmed radiographically. </p><p>PICC lines should be avoided or used with great caution in patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease due to the incidence of peripheral and central venous <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/thrombosis</span> which complicates future hemodialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/25,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,49-51</a>]. Perception of decreased risk of catheter-associated bloodstream infection with PICCs compared with alternative central catheters is not supported in the literature, especially among hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. As such, we discourage routine use of PICCs in patients at risk for future hemodialysis access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103794\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency central access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achieving rapid intravenous access is essential in the care of critically-ill patients, including those undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Volume resuscitation does not generally require central access if sufficient peripheral IV access can be obtained (eg, 14 or 16 gauge IV catheters). Peripheral IV access is preferred due to the higher flow rates that can be achieved through these short, large-bore catheters. However, peripheral access may be challenging in patients with hypovolemic shock. Under these circumstances, a single-lumen, large-bore central venous introducer sheath is often used. (See <a href=\"#H3103759\" class=\"local\">'Nontunneled'</a> above.)</p><p>Femoral venous access is less likely to disrupt CPR, whereas subclavian or internal jugular insertion may interfere with chest compressions or intubation efforts. In a small, randomized study of patients receiving CPR, real-time ultrasound-guided femoral catheterization was faster and more likely to be successful than other approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

While preparing and draping the patient, a supine position is adequate. The bed or table should be placed at a height that allows the operator to remain comfortable throughout the procedure. The patient is positioned to maximize the diameter of the vein during the vascular access procedure, which depends upon the site selected. Although Trendelenburg position facilitates venous filling for jugular and subclavian access and may reduce the risk of venous air embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-62</a>], critically ill and obese patients may not tolerate this position.

Once the device is in place, the sheath is removed. A brief description of the placement of these devices compared with standard percutaneous central catheters is given below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177534183\"><span class=\"h3\">Venous sheath placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The introducer sheath (eg, Cordis) is a combined dilator and sheath assembly with a side port for intravenous access. Once the guidewire is in place and the vessel is dilated, the dilator and sheath are advanced over the guidewire together. The dilator and guidewire are then removed, leaving the sheath in place. Once the sheath is in place, the side port is aspirated and irrigated to check function, and the sheath is sutured to the skin at its exit site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177534144\"><span class=\"h3\">Tunneled catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous access for tunneled catheters is obtained in a manner similar to nontunneled catheters. The exit site of the catheter on the skin is chosen, which determines the length of catheter that will be needed for proper catheter tip positioning. For some tunneled catheters, the excess length of catheter provided is trimmed before the catheter is tunneled; for others, it can be trimmed afterward. Other types of catheters come in fixed lengths (eg, dialysis catheters) and the position of the exit site is chosen to accommodate the predetermined length of the catheter. For subclavian and jugular tunneled catheters, the exit site on the chest wall should be located below the midclavicle in a position that does not interfere with clothing or upper extremity mobility.</p><p>Percutaneous access is performed as outlined above. Once the guidewire is in position, the skin at the guidewire exit site is incised to accommodate at least the diameter of the catheter. Following administration of local anesthesia to the catheter exit site and planned subcutaneous tunnel, an incision is made at the planned catheter exit site. A tunneling device is usually included in the catheter kit, and it is attached to the end-hole of the catheter. The catheter is advanced subcutaneously from the catheter exit site to the guidewire exit site, and the tunneler is removed. Care is taken to ensure that the tunnel provides a gentle curve in the catheter from the catheter exit site to the guidewire site. Acute angulation may lead to poor flow rates and catheter malfunction. After dilating the vein, the <span class=\"nowrap\">dilator/sheath</span> combination is placed over the wire. The dilator is removed, and the catheter is advanced through the sheath and the sheath peeled away. The position of the tip of the catheter is checked and adjusted, as needed. The cuff of the tunneled catheter is ideally located at the exit site of the catheter, but it may come to rest more cranially. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177534152\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcutaneous ports</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For subcutaneous port placement, a pocket is created for the port device after venous access has been established. Prior to placing the port, the function should be checked by inserting a needle and irrigating with saline, which should flow freely through the port hub. </p><p>Once the guidewire is in place, local anesthetic is administered into the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the planned pocket. An incision is made through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. With electrocautery, a pocket is created to accommodate the device by undermining the subcutaneous tissue. The device is placed into the pocket, and the size of the pocket and orientation of the device is adjusted as needed. </p><p>Once the pocket is completed, the catheter is tunneled from the pocket to the guidewire exit site, if needed (eg, jugular venous access). Care is taken to avoid catheter angulation which will lead to mechanical dysfunction. After dilating the vein, the <span class=\"nowrap\">dilator/sheath</span> combination is placed over the wire. The dilator is removed and the catheter is placed through the sheath, and the sheath peeled away. The catheter is positioned and adjusted as needed. The excess catheter is trimmed and attached to the hub of the port device, which is placed into the pocket and sutured into place. Placing sutures in at least three points of fixation into fascial tissue is important to prevent port rotation, which can transpose the access hub away from the skin surface making access impossible. The subcutaneous tissues and skin are sutured closed. Prior to dressing the wound, the port should be accessed through the skin, and the port aspirated and irrigated to confirm its proper functioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232392311\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRMATION OF CATHETER TIP POSITIONING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirmation of catheter tip positioning can use one or more of the following methods: chest radiography, fluoroscopy, ultrasound, transesophageal echocardiography (typically intraoperative), and endocavitary electrocardiography (EC-ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/71-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-80</a>]. Chest radiography and fluoroscopy are the most commonly used methods in the United States. </p><p>We generally obtain a postprocedure chest radiograph to confirm the course of the catheter and position of the tip prior to use of jugular and subclavian catheters in nonemergency situations. Femoral catheters do not generally require radiologic confirmation of position. Some studies have questioned the need for routine radiography for uncomplicated right internal jugular catheters placed with a single needle pass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/74,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,76,77</a>]. Alternatives to radiography, particularly in critical care settings or in the operative room, include ultrasound and transesophageal echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H177533298\" class=\"local\">'Use of ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-transesophageal-echocardiography-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another alternative, EC-ECG, relies on the recognition of typical P wave patterns during catheter positioning. Once the catheter has been inserted into the vein, it is connected via a wide-bore needle to an electrocardiograph monitor lead. On the ECG tracing, a normally shaped P wave identifies the mid-to-upper superior vena cava, the widest P wave indicates the central catheter tip at the superior vena cava-right atrium junction, and a biphasic P wave identifies the location of the right atrium. Several reviews in pediatric and hemodialysis populations have confirmed the utility of this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-84</a>]. In the largest review of over 1000 cases, the technique was successfully applied in 98.3 percent. Preexisting cardiac arrhythmias constituted the main reason for not being able to use the technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>The optimal positioning of the tip of the catheter depends on the specific access site. In general, catheters function well with the tip situated in any major vein. However, suboptimal tip position may be related to delayed complications. If a catheter is malpositioned within the venous system, it may still be used under emergency circumstances but should be repositioned as soon as feasible. In contrast, inadvertent placement of a catheter into the arterial system mandates immediate attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-central-venous-access/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p>Catheter tip confirmation and positioning, management of malpositioned catheters, and management of inadvertent arterial puncture are discussed separately for the commonly used access sites.

Catheter site management and catheter care are discussed elsewhere.

Central venous access is also used to facilitate insertion of vascular devices, including inferior vena cava filters, pacemakers, and defibrillators, and to perform venous interventions. (See <a href=\"#H3103243\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe coagulopathy is a relative contraindication to central venous catheterization, with thrombocytopenia posing a greater risk than prolonged clotting time. The subclavian approach is often avoided in patients at high risk for bleeding due to an inability to effectively monitor or compress the venipuncture site. If central access is absolutely necessary, the most experienced individual available should perform the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H177530472\" class=\"local\">'Coagulopathy and/or thrombocytopenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous catheters can be inserted through the jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins, or via upper arm peripheral veins. The type of catheter and site chosen are often determined by the clinical scenario of the individual patient and provider preference. The optimal site is determined by operator experience, patient anatomy, and clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H3103787\" class=\"local\">'Site selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to the placement of central catheters, we recommend ultrasound imaging to evaluate venous patency in patients who have a history of vascular instrumentation or prior deep vein thrombosis in the region of the proposed access site. (See <a href=\"#H177533298\" class=\"local\">'Use of ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Real-time ultrasound imaging during vessel puncture reduces time to venous cannulation and the risk of complications. Thus, ultrasound guidance is recommended when equipment and expertise are available, and is particularly useful in pediatric venous access and in high-risk patients, such as those with coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"#H177533298\" class=\"local\">'Use of ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous catheterization is performed through a series of well-defined steps. Venous sheaths are placed in a similar manner. (See <a href=\"#H3104780\" class=\"local\">'General technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography is often used to confirm jugular and subclavian catheter placement prior to use in nonemergency situations. Femoral catheters do not generally require radiological confirmation of position. The need to confirm placement in all patients undergoing jugular venous access procedures is controversial. Periprocedural ultrasound is an alternative aid to avoid catheter malposition and detect pneumothorax.
