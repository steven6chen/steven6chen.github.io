It is commonly associated with impairments in social and occupational functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is among the most disabling and economically catastrophic medical disorders, ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the top ten illnesses contributing to the global burden of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Antipsychotic medications are first-line medication treatment for schizophrenia. They have been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating symptoms and behaviors associated with the disorder. Antipsychotic medications have significant side effects; assessment and management of these adverse effects are an important part of treatment. Evidence-based psychosocial interventions in conjunction with pharmacotherapy can help patients achieve recovery. </p><p>This topic addresses the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia in acute and maintenance phase treatment. Discussed separately are the use of long-acting antipsychotics and management of side effects during pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia; the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of schizophrenia; psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia; and common comorbid presentations of schizophrenia.

Clozapine is more effective for patients who do not respond fully to other antipsychotics, but due to increased risk of agranulocytosis is reserved for those who do not respond well to or cannot tolerate other antipsychotics.

The trial randomly assigned 461 patients with stable schizophrenia and predominant negative symptoms to receive cariprazine or risperidone. After 26 weeks, patients assigned to cariprazine showed a greater mean reduction in negative symptoms on the Positive&nbsp;and Negative Syndrome Scale compared with risperidone-treated patients, with a small to medium effect size.

Small statistically significant reductions in negative symptoms were found for second-generation antipsychotics, antidepressants, glutamatergic agents, and combinations of these medications, but not for first-generation antipsychotics and brain stimulation. None of the beneficial effects for any of the medication strategies were considered to be of a clinically significant magnitude.

As a result, the selection of an antipsychotic is often based on these considerations. The selection may vary for select populations including individuals in a first psychotic episode, individuals who are only partial responders to antipsychotics, patients who are agitated, and individuals who are sensitive to particular side effects such as weight gain, EPS, or sedation. (See <a href=\"#H16350492\" class=\"local\">'Poor response to initial treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16350527\" class=\"local\">'First-episode psychosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18522653\" class=\"local\">'Acutely agitated'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Antipsychotic medications are commonly grouped into two categories, with &ldquo;second-generation&rdquo; (or &ldquo;atypical&rdquo;) applied to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> and all antipsychotics first marketed after clozapine was approved in 1989, and &ldquo;first-generation&rdquo; applied to antipsychotics marketed previously. Recent clinical research, however, has strongly suggested that the distinction between first- and second-generation antipsychotics has questionable validity and is confusing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The pharmacologic properties, therapeutic effects, and adverse effects are not distinct between and are heterogeneous within the groups. Nevertheless, the terms first- and second-generation antipsychotic are still in widespread use. A valid distinction is that the newer (second-generation) antipsychotics tend to cause fewer extrapyramidal side effects than the older ones, particularly at the high end of approved dosage ranges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16350464\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of most antipsychotic drugs should be titrated from an initial dose to the therapeutic range as quickly as tolerated. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloperidone</a> need to be increased gradually before reaching a therapeutic dose. The timeframe for titration differs for each drug and also depends on the individual patient&rsquo;s tolerance of the drug&rsquo;s tendency to cause sedation and hypotension. In most cases, patients can reach a therapeutic level in five or six days with quetiapine and iloperidone, and two to three weeks with clozapine. Suggested dosing and side effect profiles for each antipsychotic drug are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Because identifying the appropriate dose range can be difficult in the pre-marketing phases of drug development, the antipsychotic doses listed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>) deviate somewhat from those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, reflecting more recent research findings or clinical experience. Examples include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Haloperidol</a> is effective and most useful at doses drastically below the FDA-specified maximum of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Optimal haloperidol dosages are usually below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and almost always below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal dosages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> are lower than the approved 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> typically, a maximum dose for risperidone is 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. </p><p/><p>Resolution of psychotic symptoms generally occurs over several days and may take as much as four to six weeks. Clinicians should avoid the impulse to change the medication or dose prematurely. Once the dose reaches the therapeutic range, the decision to increase the dose should follow at least several days of treatment during which the individual shows little or no improvement. Higher dosing should be accompanied by careful observation of the patient for side effects. If patients fail to show improvement on doses above the usual therapeutic range, the dose should be reduced. </p><p>As an example, a patient treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> can be started on 2 mg administered as a single daily dose or 1 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated (ie, minimal sedation, hypotension, or akathisia) the dose can be increased to 3 mg on the second day and 4 mg on the third day. Since 4 mg is in the therapeutic range for most patients, the clinician may then choose to continue this dose for an additional two weeks before considering an increase. If the patient shows only minimal or no improvement, the dose can be increased up to 8 mg daily with careful monitoring for clinical response and side effects. Doses of risperidone above 8 mg daily are associated with substantial risk of EPS.</p><p>Because of dose-related toxicities, antipsychotics should be used at the lowest dose that is effective for an individual. The toxicities of antipsychotic drugs typically increase with higher doses while therapeutic effects can reach a maximum. At high doses, the adverse effects of an antipsychotic may surpass the marginal benefit of dosage increases. As a result, increasing the dose of antipsychotic for a patient who is already experiencing significant EPS is unlikely to result in additional symptom reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7468570\"><span class=\"h2\">Course of response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a patient with schizophrenia is administered an antipsychotic medication, the initial response is often a side effect such as sedation, restlessness, or postural hypotension. It is important to explain this to patients, or they may conclude that the medication is ineffective or worsening their condition. Most patients who will improve on an antipsychotic show the most rapid improvement in the first two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although the rate of improvement may slow after two weeks, patients will often continue to improve during subsequent weeks and months.</p><p>During the first weeks of treatment, patients may first experience a decrease in the severity of symptoms. As a result, the impact of symptoms on patient behavior may be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Hallucinations or delusions may be less frightening or the patient may find that they can distract themselves by focusing their attention elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The 2009 Schizophrenia PORT recommends that trials last for two to six weeks. This timeframe will be slightly longer for antipsychotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloperidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, which require slow titration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365616195\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose adjustments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of nonresponse or partial response, the antipsychotic dose can be gradually increased toward the high end of the recommended range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Most careful studies of doses above the recommended range have not found higher doses to be more effective than the maximal recommended dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. If used, trials of higher doses should be time limited, with reassessment planned within three months.

As an example, in the large US effectiveness study of antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia, the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), patients who gained weight during the first phase of antipsychotic treatment frequently lost weight when they were changed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>, an antipsychotic that is not associated with weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Switching antipsychotics is less clearly beneficial when the initial medication lacked effectiveness.

Calming effects may take 30 to 60 minutes following oral administration.</p><p/><p>Although repeat administration of an oral or intramuscular antipsychotic is common when the prior dose does not sufficiently reduce agitation, the overall antipsychotic dose should be limited, because these medications can cause significant side effects such as hypotension, EPS, and sedation, particularly at high doses over a brief period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H18522653\" class=\"local\">'Acutely agitated'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medication may be useful for patients with schizophrenia when non-adherence to oral antipsychotics leads to frequent relapse. LAI antipsychotics are administered at two to four week intervals. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a> decanoate can be administered at a dose between 6.25 to 50 mg intramuscularly every two weeks. Extrapyramidal symptoms can be prominent at higher doses. (See <a href=\"#H16350541\" class=\"local\">'Medication adherence'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Long-acting injectable antipsychotic drugs&quot;</a>.) </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Psychiatric Association.
