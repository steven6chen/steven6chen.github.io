Members of<em> Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) are the most common pulmonary NTM pathogens in almost all regions of the world. The three predominate species to cause human disease within this complex are <em>M. avium</em>, <em>M. intracellulare</em>, and <em>M. chimaera</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]<em>.</em> </p><p>The treatment of MAC pulmonary infections will be reviewed here. The management of lung disease caused by other slow-growing NTM, such as <em>Mycobacterium kansasii</em>, <em>Mycobacterium malmoense, and Mycobacterium xenopi, </em>and by rapidly growing mycobacterium, such as <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em>, <em>Mycobacterium fortuitum</em> complex, and <em>Mycobacterium chelonae</em>, are discussed separately.

For this reason, it has been suggested that clinical categorization might have advantages over the standard radiologic categorization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients could be classified by whether pulmonary MAC is the presenting disease or whether pulmonary MAC is superimposed on pre-existing lung disease such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, treatment decisions remain dependent on the radiologic criteria. Expert consultation should be obtained for patients who are difficult to categorize into one of the two standard radiologic groups defined above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DECIDING TO TREAT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients warrant treatment of MAC pulmonary disease at the time of diagnosis. Antimycobacterial treatment is prolonged, with drugs that can be difficult to tolerate, and the long-term response rates are modest. Frequently, close observation rather than antibiotic treatment is warranted, but most patients progress over time, and many will ultimately merit antibiotic therapy. </p><p>For patients who have met the diagnostic criteria of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61404 \">table 1</a>), decisions on the timing of treatment depend on the type of disease and the risk of progression.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with fibrocavitary disease, treatment is generally warranted at the time of initial diagnosis, because this type of disease may be associated with rapid progression and destructive disease. (See <a href=\"#H53437783\" class=\"local\">'Without treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with nodular bronchiectatic disease, the decision to observe or treat depends on the clinical presentation and the overall clinical status of the patient. Observation is reasonable in the setting of minimal symptoms or radiographic findings or in patients with concurrent medical problems that are of greater morbidity than the MAC lung infection. Observation consists of interval clinical evaluation, sputum cultures, and serial imaging with chest radiograph or computed tomography. In one survey, experts in the treatment of MAC lung disease reported that no antimicrobials were used to treat new cases between 10 and 25 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies have not determined the optimal frequency of monitoring for disease progression among patients who are deferring therapy. In our experience, the appropriate frequency varies depending on the extent of disease. In general, sputum cultures should be obtained every two to three months and repeat imaging after approximately six months. Increasing bacterial load, as evidenced by a change from smear-negative to smear-positive sputum or increasing quantitative culture results (if such cultures are available), suggest progression of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Development of cavitation or worsening nodularity would also be a sign of progressive disease. These developments typically warrant initiation of therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to cavitary disease, low body mass index (BMI) has been consistently identified as a risk factor for progressive disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/4,9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-14</a>]. Other described factors include male gender, older age, presence of comorbidities, and the number of lung segments involved. Laboratory parameters associated with disease progression have included elevated estimated sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as anemia and hypoalbuminemia. These features alone are not necessarily indications to initiate treatment but are considerations when weighing the potential risks of treatment versus the risk of progression.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2010713918\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organisms within MAC are typically susceptible to macrolides and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a>, with varying susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifabutin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a>, fluoroquinolones, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, and aminoglycosides.</p><p>Drug susceptibility testing is currently recommended by expert panels on a routine basis for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There is no proven value (ie, correlation between in vitro susceptibility and clinical or in vivo response) for in vitro susceptibility testing for antimycobacterial agents other than the macrolides, and perhaps <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, for MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. However, testing for additional drugs may be useful information as intolerance to the first-line drugs is common and could necessitate the use of alternative agents with in vitro activity. Although there are not data demonstrating good correlation with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and clinical outcome, the selection of alternative drugs should be based on whether drugs have some activity in vitro. Synergy testing has not been correlated with clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], but the consistent demonstration of synergy among rifamycins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a> suggest these drugs should be combined when possible.</p><p>Typical MICs for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> are 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> with resistance defined as an MIC greater than &ge;32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> with broth microdilution. Under selective pressure of macrolide therapy, mutations in the drug's ribosomal binding site can result in MICs above 64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Aminoglycosides (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>) are important antimicrobial agents for patients with cavitary disease or macrolide resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>], but we do not recommend the use of amikacin as part of an antimycobacterial regimen when MICs are &gt;64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or when the A1408G mutation is present. Most studies have not shown any correlation between aminoglycoside in vitro susceptibility and clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, one study using broth microdilution assays to determine amikacin MICs of 462 clinical MAC isolates suggested that prolonged amikacin exposure can lead to development of amikacin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of these isolates, seven (1.5 percent) had MICs of &gt;64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and all were noted to have a 16S rRNA gene A1408G mutation, which was not detected in isolates with lower MICs. Clinical data were available for five of those seven isolates and confirmed significant prior amikacin exposure. Based on these results, the authors recommended primary testing of amikacin against MAC isolates and propose MIC guidelines or breakpoints be changed to reflect the same Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's (CLSI's) guidelines for <em>M.</em> <em>abscessus</em>: &lt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for susceptible, 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for intermediate, and &gt;64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for resistant. Similarly, in a randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of inhaled liposomal amikacin, microbiologic responses were observed among study participants whose isolates had an MIC to amikacin up to 64, but none of the patients with an isolate with an MIC &gt;64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> had a microbiologic response, and all had the same A1408G mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394560080\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200369634\"><span class=\"h2\">Regimen selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regimen selection depends, in part, on susceptibility to macrolides; most MAC isolates, particularly in patients who have not been treated before, are macrolide susceptible. For initial treatment of patients with MAC lung disease, we generally choose a three-drug regimen containing a macrolide, a rifamycin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a>. For patients who have severe or fibrocavitary disease, a parenteral aminoglycoside is also often used in the initial phase of treatment. </p><p>Our preferred macrolide and rifamycin are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, respectively.

Nevertheless, even with macrolide-containing regimens, response to MAC therapy is modest, in part because of the difficulty in tolerating the regimen. As an example, in a meta-analysis of 16 studies (mainly observational but also a few trials), the weighted rate of microbiologic treatment success (12 months of negative cultures while on therapy) was 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Therefore, we typically obtain sputum cultures every one to two months following treatment initiation to monitor treatment efficacy. Once sustained conversion (repeated negative sputum cultures) has been documented, sputum cultures can be obtained less frequently. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the patient is not producing sputum, we recommend a sputum induction with hypertonic saline. The likelihood of conversion to negative cultures is unlikely within the first few months of therapy for most pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species. However, earlier documentation of sputum conversion allows optimization of treatment duration, which is based on the length of time with negative cultures. (See <a href=\"#H1920218984\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lack of microbiological response after six months of therapy or recurrent positive sputa after achieving persistent negative cultures warrant further evaluation.

However, there is no evidence that this frequency of imaging changes clinical outcomes. At a minimum, we suggest obtaining imaging at the beginning of treatment, the end of treatment, and with any concerns for microbiologic or clinical failure during treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2183003533\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic drug monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in the management of patients with NTM infections is uncertain. Clear indications for TDM include the presence of multiple drug interactions, suspected or known malabsorption, and treatment failure. It is also reasonable to obtain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a> levels in patients with renal dysfunction. </p><p>In one study of patients receiving daily versus intermittent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> therapy, lower azithromycin peak levels (Cmax) were observed in those on daily therapy because of the lower daily dose (250 mg) when used with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Among those on daily therapy, an azithromycin Cmax &gt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> was independently associated with a favorable microbiologic outcome. This suggests that if the microbiologic response is poor, checking the azithromycin Cmax and adjusting the dose may be beneficial. </p><p>However, other studies have not demonstrated such an association. In a pharmacokinetic analysis of drug levels among 481 patients undergoing macrolide-based multidrug therapy for MAC lung disease, suboptimal levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a> were common, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> coadministration further decreased macrolide levels, and pharmacodynamic indices infrequently predicted bactericidal activity for most agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, the clinical meaningfulness of the minimum inhibitory concentration (on which target drug levels are based) of non-macrolide drugs for MAC is uncertain, and this study did not evaluate the correlation between drug levels and clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a separate study of 101 patients with MAC lung disease treated with a clarithromycin-based multidrug regimen, there was no difference in peak plasma drug levels between those with (n = 75) and without (n = 26) microbiological response after 12 months, even though almost all the patients had clarithromycin levels below the target range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2569609074\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FAILURE OR RELAPSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is currently no widely accepted definition for treatment failure, although most experts define it as the failure to achieve culture conversion after 6 to 12 months of therapy. Patients with treatment failure warrant evaluation for adherence to the drug regimen, assessment of serum drug concentrations, and susceptibility testing to macrolides and other drugs that may be needed for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2010713918\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment susceptibility testing'</a> above.) </p><p>Some patients may respond clinically <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographically but remain culture positive beyond six months. In these settings, we would generally continue the macrolide-based regimen if the isolate is still susceptible. However, it the patient remains culture positive after 12 months, most would agree that the patient is failing therapy. If the patient has been on intermittent therapy, we switch to daily administration. In a study from Korea, of 20 patients whose sputum remained positive after 12 months of intermittent antibiotic therapy, six (30 percent) achieved a negative culture after a change to daily therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Once treatment failure has occurred, other interventions that should be considered include administration of an aminoglycoside <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resectional surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1718855257\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients who had cleared sputum cultures on treatment, we continue to check sputum cultures every six months following treatment. Recurrent MAC growth in the sputum after having achieved sustained sputum conversion (persistently negative cultures) can represent either relapse of the original infection or reinfection with a new strain. Recurrence rates have been noted to be as high as 48 percent, with a majority representing reinfection rather than true relapse identified by genotyping the strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Unfortunately, genotyping is not readily available, and the methods used have not been validated. Re-treatment is the same regardless of whether the patient has suffered a relapse or reinfection, and regimen selection is the same as for initial treatment, depending on whether the isolate is macrolide sensitive (see <a href=\"#H863632307\" class=\"local\">'Macrolide-susceptible infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1421602479\" class=\"local\">'Macrolide-resistant infection'</a> above). Macrolide resistance is more likely with relapsed disease. Reinfection should prompt a review of possible environmental sources of infection.
