Two controlled family studies of pediatric patients with OCD found the lifetime prevalence of OCD to be significantly higher in familial cases compared with control relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

A large segregation analysis of OCD supported an autosomal dominant or co-dominant model, and rejected a recessive model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

When simple Mendelian models were compared, the dominant model provided a better fit to the data than the other Mendelian models. </p><p>A genome-wide linkage analysis of OCD in seven families of pediatric OCD patients identified a region on chromosome 9 with suggestive evidence for linkage.

Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts, images, or urges. </p><p>Obsessions are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary. They are intrusive, unwanted, and cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. A person suffering from OCD attempts to ignore, avoid, or suppress obsessions, or may try to neutralize them with another thought or action (eg, performing a compulsion). </p><p>Compulsions (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (eg, washing, checking) or mental acts (eg, counting, repeating words silently) that may be performed in response to an obsession or according to rules that may be applied rigidly. Compulsions are not rationally connected to the feared event, or are clearly excessive.</p><p>Although there is demonstrated continuity in the presentation of OCD in children and adults, the nature of obsessions and compulsions differ between youths and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In adults the male:female ratio of OCD is approximately 1:1, while pediatric OCD is more common in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Boys typically have an earlier age of onset (7 to 9 years) of OCD than girls (11 to 13 years), although it can occur earlier in both genders. </p><p>Detecting obsessions can be more difficult in children with OCD compared to adults with the disorder. While compulsions can usually be observed, very young children may be unable to describe obsessive thoughts verbally or describe their aim in carrying out a compulsive action. Insight into the excessiveness or absurdity of the symptoms is characteristic in adults, but can be more difficult to identify particularly in younger children with OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Developmental considerations should be considered when examining a child&rsquo;s expression of obsessions and compulsions. Children with OCD are more likely than adults with OCD to present with compulsions without obvious obsessive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Obsessions and compulsions in children are more likely to <span class=\"nowrap\">change/evolve</span> as well as wax and wane.

Assessment of these symptoms and behaviors over the child&rsquo;s lifetime is particularly important in OCD, because obsessions and compulsions can wax and wane and change during the child&rsquo;s developmental maturation. (See <a href=\"#H49086543\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>All patients should undergo a medical history and physical examination as part of a diagnostic assessment. Neurologic examination should assess for signs or symptoms indicating possible deficits or injury in brain regions implicated in OCD (eg, basal ganglia, frontal cortex, thalamus) and rule out other <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/neurologic</span> conditions as a cause. </p><p>Inquiries about repeated streptococcal infections, rheumatic fever, or Sydenham&rsquo;s chorea are important, particularly if they coincide with <span class=\"nowrap\">onset/exacerbation</span> of obsessive and compulsive symptoms, because group A beta hemolytic streptococcal infections have been associated with OCD in some children. Assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-a-streptococcal-tonsillopharyngitis-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the primary disorder, the child should be examined for co-occurring psychiatric disorders, particularly those that occur at an increased rate in OCD. (See <a href=\"#H269256670\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p>The patient&rsquo;s family history should be reviewed for OCD given genetic studies showing that a positive family history is associated with an elevated risk of the disorder in children.

These screening tools can be administered quickly and inexpensively and without the need for additional clinician training.

(See <a href=\"#H86799332\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OCD affects more than three million people in the United States. Estimates of the disorder&rsquo;s United States lifetime prevalence in both pediatric and adult populations have ranged from 1 to 3 percent. More than half of pediatric patients with OCD have been found to have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder, including tic disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and mood and anxiety disorders. (See <a href=\"#H86799339\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Research suggests that multiple genetic risk factors lead to changes in cellular function or altered neurotransmitter signaling. These molecular and cellular changes perturb fronto-striatal-thalamic circuitry (FSTC), resulting in OCD. (See <a href=\"#H86799346\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder are obsessions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compulsions that are time-consuming, cause clinically significant distress or impair functioning. Young children, compared to older children and adults, are less likely (and able to) describe obsessions in conjunction with observed compulsive actions, and less likely to have insight into the excessiveness or absurdity of their OCD symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H49086758\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Research suggests that approximately 50 percent of all cases of OCD have their onset in childhood or adolescence. The prognosis for pediatric OCD appears to be better than the prognosis for adult onset OCD. (See <a href=\"#H86799541\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is particularly important that assessment for obsessions and compulsions evaluates children's lifetime, because OCD symptoms can wax and wane and change during the child&rsquo;s developmental maturation.
