Coma is therefore the most profound degree to which the two components of consciousness, arousal and awareness, can be diminished. Less profound states of impaired consciousness (stupor, lethargy, obtundation) preserve one or more of these components to some degree.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to the acute management of a child presenting with altered arousal. The differential diagnosis and evaluation of stupor and coma in children and the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of stupor and coma in adults are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of stupor and coma in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early treatment of coma is generally supportive until a definitive diagnosis is made. An important goal of early treatment is to limit brain injury. </p><p>Although discussed separately, the assessment and management of children in coma are performed jointly in practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62416 \">table 1</a>). The primacy of ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) applies to coma as to other medical emergencies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing a secure airway and providing adequate ventilation may be lifesaving and also may limit neurologic injury. Establishing a secure airway in a patient with coma may be attained by repositioning the child to open the airway, but often requires intubation to ensure adequate ventilation and to prevent aspiration of secretions or gastric contents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt;8 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 2</a>) are usually unable to adequately protect their airway and should be intubated. If trauma is suspected, the cervical spine should be stabilized with a collar while securing the airway. Approaches to minimize the impact of intubation on potentially elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen saturation should be continuously monitored and supplemental oxygen provided (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>). Adequacy of ventilation should be assessed by examination, end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood gases. </p><p>For most patients, the goal of assisted ventilation is to maintain normal carbon dioxide levels (ie, PaO<sub>2</sub> 35 to 40 mmHg); hypo- and hyperventilation should be avoided since both can contribute to secondary brain injury. Hyperventilation is reserved only for patients with acute or impending herniation. In this setting it is provided as a temporary measure while awaiting more definitive intervention.

There are fewer studies regarding minimally conscious patients, but the prognosis is probably less dire. Accurate differentiation of minimally conscious patients from vegetative patients requires repeated assessments by an experienced multidisciplinary team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies hold promise for better classification of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3038919506\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis in coma is largely specific to the etiology.

In a meta-analysis including patients older than 10 years of age with HIE, EEG findings of an isoelectric baseline or a burst suppression pattern during the first week after coma were 100 percent specific for poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This finding, however, is not predictive of a poor outcome in other toxic metabolic encephalopathies. Other EEG patterns (eg, periodic epileptiform discharges, nonreactive rhythms) have been associated with poor outcome, but have poor sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/33,39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39,42</a>].</p><p>EEG may have additional benefit of identifying nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which can both cause coma and complicate other etiologies of coma, including infection and metabolic disease.

The test is technically more demanding to perform, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Also, patients with focal brain lesions, subdural hemorrhage, or craniotomy may have an absent (false-positive) EP response; data should be interpreted with caution in these patients. EP should be performed more than 24 hours after the onset of coma and reconfirmed 24 hours after the initial examination in order to maximize specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>SEPs have high specificity and are more useful than EEG in predicting poor outcome in both children and adults in coma, especially due to HIE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/39,41,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,46,47</a>].

However, four, all with TBI, did survive with mild to moderate neurologic deficits. A systematic review of SEPs for prognosis in coma in patients of all ages, published before this report, found an overall false-positive rate of &lt;0.5 percent; however, it noted that most of the false positives were children and cases of TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Another systematic review included an independent analysis of 10 studies done in children in coma.

A high score had a sensitivity of 96 percent and specificity of 50 percent for moderate to severe disability.

S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) have been investigated the most; neither is used routinely in clinical practice.
