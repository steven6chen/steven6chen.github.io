It can occur at any age, but there is a bimodal distribution to the age of onset with an early peak in the second and third decades (female predominance) and a late peak in the sixth to eighth decade (male predominance). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two clinical forms of myasthenia: ocular and generalized. In ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG), the weakness is limited to the eyelids and extraocular muscles. In generalized disease, the weakness commonly affects the ocular muscles, but it also involves a variable combination of bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 50 percent of patients with MG present with ocular symptoms of ptosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diplopia. Of those who present with ocular manifestations, about half will remain purely ocular. About 15 percent of patients present with bulbar symptoms. These include fatigable chewing, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Less than 5 percent present with proximal limb weakness alone. Involvement of the muscles of respiration produces the most serious symptoms in MG, such as respiratory insufficiency and pending respiratory failure, termed myasthenic crisis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In all patients with clinically suspected MG, the diagnosis should be confirmed, if possible, by immunologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrodiagnostic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77349 \">table 1</a>). Testing for autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab) should be performed on all patients. An assay for antibodies to muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) should be performed if the AChR-Abs are negative. Seropositive myasthenia gravis refers to patients with MG who have detectable AChR or MuSK antibodies. Seronegative myasthenia gravis refers to patients with MG who have negative standard assays for both AChR antibodies and MuSK antibodies. About half of patients with purely OMG are seropositive, compared with nearly four-fifths of those with generalized disease. MuSK antibody-positive MG has a female predominance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'MuSK antibodies'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with AChR antibody-positive MG have thymic abnormalities, including hyperplasia in 60 to 70 percent and thymoma in 10 to 12 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy has a variable effect on the course of MG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, women with myasthenia that is under good control before pregnancy can be reassured that they are likely to remain stable throughout pregnancy, although a small proportion may have worsening in the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For women with active MG before pregnancy, flares are most likely to occur in the first trimester and the postpartum period. </p><p>In one review of 322 pregnancies in 225 myasthenic patients, exacerbation, remission, and no change in disease occurred in 41, 29, and 30 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additionally, postpartum exacerbations were noted in 30 percent of all patients. These findings have been confirmed by other, smaller studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p>As already noted, the first trimester and the acute postpartum period are times of highest risk for exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mortality risk of the mother with MG is inversely proportional to the duration of disease, with the highest risk being within the first year after disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Myasthenic flare may occur after therapeutic abortion secondary to the stress of surgery, but it usually remits following spontaneous abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3268874826\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL MG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient neonatal MG develops in 10 to 20 percent of infants born to myasthenic mothers due to transplacental passage of IgG anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Though definitive data are lacking, a small retrospective study found no correlation between neonatal MG and the maternal IgG anti-acetylcholine receptor titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, a small prospective study found that the duration of maternal disease and medication usage for MG were not associated with the occurrence of neonatal MG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Among mothers with a child affected by transient neonatal MG, the risk of recurrence with subsequent pregnancies is approximately 75 percent.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment issues'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymectomy in the year prior to conception is unlikely to result in clinical remission of myasthenia in the mother before pregnancy, and its impact on the risk of neonatal MG is undetermined. Most experts advise young women to proceed with thymectomy as soon as possible, with the exception of those who are already pregnant or anticipating pregnancy in the next few months. In such cases, thymectomy should be postponed until after pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Retrospective analysis of data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway found that neonates of mothers with MG who had undergone thymectomy were less likely to develop neonatal MG than those born to mothers without thymectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">(9/72</span> [13 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">17/63</span> [27 percent], relative risk 0.4, 95% CI 0.16-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These results suggest that thymectomy has a protective effect against neonatal MG. Of note, 25 of the 41 thymectomized mothers had undergone thymectomy an average of five years before the first birth, allowing more time for the benefit of thymectomy to accumulate. However, the strength of this study is limited by the retrospective design, lack of randomization and blinding, and wide confidence intervals.</p><p>It is important to note that the beneficial effects thymectomy are delayed for all patients and may take years to accrue, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2009410266\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the normal physiologic changes associated with pregnancy may affect the course of MG, the treatment of MG in pregnancy is similar to that in patients who are not pregnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation of the pregnant patient with MG includes assessment of baseline motor strength, respiratory status, and pulmonary function tests. Cardiac status should be followed with electrocardiograms (ECGs), since rare occurrences of focal myocardial necrosis have been recorded in patients with MG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Dose adjustment may be required in pregnancy as a result of increased renal clearance, expanded maternal blood volume, delayed gastric emptying, and frequent emesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Increasing the dose of pyridostigmine should first be accomplished by decreasing the interval of administration, followed by increasing the dose if symptoms persist.

During labor, however, anticholinesterase medications should be administered parenterally to avoid erratic gastrointestinal absorption. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Labor and delivery'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> is the immunosuppressant of choice in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition to glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> may be used if anticholinesterases fail to control MG exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These medications have been well studied in pregnancy, mainly in transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune diseases other than MG, and have been found to be relatively safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, high doses of cyclosporine and azathioprine have been linked to spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, low birth weight, chromosomal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,20</a>], and hematologic suppression; they should be reserved for pregnant women who are not controlled, cannot tolerate glucocorticoids, or have significant comorbidities that may worsen with glucocorticoid administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19-21</a>].

Glucocorticoids may also produce carbohydrate intolerance, especially during pregnancy. Even though there are no teratogenic effects from glucocorticoids, pregnant patients with MG who rely on these medications should be maintained on the lowest possible dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].

In contrast, the second stage of labor may be affected because the voluntary striated muscles used during expulsive efforts may easily weaken. Excessive maternal fatigue may result. Appropriate steps should be taken to circumvent the effects of maternal fatigue on delivery, since stress and exertion can precipitate a myasthenic crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Operative vaginal delivery may reduce maternal fatigue and weakness. Nevertheless, consensus guidelines note that spontaneous vaginal delivery is the objective and should be encouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cesarean delivery should be reserved for the usual obstetrical indications.</p><p>Consultation with an anesthesiologist before labor is recommended, since patients with myasthenia who undergo general anesthesia may be at increased risk for requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Selection of anesthetic technique is dependent on several factors. Regional anesthesia is recommended for mild to moderate disease when vaginal delivery is anticipated, allowing for adequate anesthesia if vacuum or forceps are needed; it also can reduce fatigue associated with the second stage of labor. General endotracheal anesthesia is recommended for the patient with severe disease and compromised respiratory or bulbar status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants should be avoided, since patients with MG have altered acetylcholinesterase activity. Due to the relative resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, larger doses are often required leading to a prolonged block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with MG are more sensitive to inhaled anesthetics including enflurane, halothane, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Sedatives, opioids, and tranquilizers can potentiate respiratory depression in this population and should be administered judiciously. When using opioids or other sedatives for pain control, pulse oximetry and frequent assessment of respiratory rate is recommended. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tromethamine-tham-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tromethamine</a> may also be used for postpartum or postoperative pain.</p><p>During labor, anticholinesterase medications should be administered parenterally to avoid erratic gastrointestinal absorption. The parenteral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> is equivalent to one-thirtieth of the patient's oral dose.</p><p>The maternal respiratory status (respiratory rate, pulse oximetry) should be monitored carefully because stress and fatigue associated with labor and delivery may precipitate worsening of disease. Another issues is that chronic glucocorticoid therapy can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and lead to adrenal insufficiency during times of stress such as labor and delivery. Therefore, some experts suggest that women on long-term glucocorticoids who take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or equivalent at a dose &gt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> should receive stress-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> during the intrapartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other experts use somewhat different thresholds to determine the need for glucocorticoid coverage based upon the patient's history of glucocorticoid intake and likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, as discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of the surgical patient taking glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with MG have an increased incidence of preterm labor and birth in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], although this is not confirmed by other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Estimates of perinatal mortality rates for infants born of women with MG vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31</a>]. In a retrospective population study, perinatal mortality was not significantly higher among 127 births by Norwegian women with MG compared with those of a reference group without MG (2.4 versus 1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, mothers with MG had a significantly higher risk of delivery complications than the reference group (41 versus 33 percent); the most common complication was premature rupture of membranes. Cesarean deliveries were also performed more frequently in mothers with MG (17 versus 9 percent of deliveries); half were elective. In contrast, a population based study from Taiwan found no significant differences between pregnant women with MG and controls for the risk of delivery complicated by low birth weight, small for gestational age, or cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>An earlier study found that the death rate due to fetal anomalies was higher in the myasthenic population compared with the normal population (18 versus 2.2 per 1000 live births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2987494363\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPARTUM MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All infants of myasthenic mothers should be observed and monitored in a special care nursery for the first 48 to 72 hours of life for any evidence of weakness caused by transient neonatal MG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-myasthenia-gravis-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

For management of preeclampsia or eclampsia in women with MG, severe hypertension can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levetiracetam</a> or valproic acid can be used for seizure prophylaxis, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> can potentially exacerbate weakness and is therefore reserved for refractory seizures. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second stage of labor may be affected in patients with MG because the voluntary striated muscles used during expulsive efforts may easily weaken. Appropriate steps should be taken to circumvent the effects of maternal fatigue on delivery since stress and exertion can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants should be avoided. During labor, anticholinesterase medications should be administered parenterally to avoid erratic gastrointestinal absorption.
