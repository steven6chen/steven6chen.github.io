These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower hormones &ndash; As people age, their bodies makes less sex hormones. That's especially true for women who have gone through menopause (the time in a woman's life when she stops having monthly periods). But hormones change in men, too. In women, the decrease in hormones is more sudden, especially if they have had had their ovaries removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical conditions &ndash; Medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and chronic pain, can decrease a person's interest in or ability to have sex. In men, diabetes is a major cause of problems with erections, because it damages nerves and blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past surgery or medical treatment &ndash; Men who have had surgery or radiation therapy to treat prostate cancer often develop problems with erections. Men who have certain treatments for an enlarged prostate can have problems with orgasm. Women who have had surgery to treat problems with their bladder or sex organs or treatment for cancer can also have problems with sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression or anxiety &ndash; As people get older, they sometimes have problems with depression or anxiety. These conditions can also lead to problems with sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking in men &ndash; Men who smoke cigarettes are more likely than men who don't smoke to have problems with erections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Some of the medicines older people take to control diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, and other conditions can have side effects that cause problems with sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relationship problems &ndash; Sometimes partners have different ideas about sex and this can lead to problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874517\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are happy with the quality and amount of sex you have, and do not have pain during sex, then no, you do not need to see your doctor or nurse. But if you are not satisfied with your sex life, yes, see your doctor or nurse. He or she might have treatments or solutions to suggest.</p><p>When you go, bring all the medicines you take, including any non-prescription or herbal medicines. Also, be honest about what is going on. Talking about sex and relationships can be embarrassing, but doctors and nurses are used to talking about it. Your doctor or nurse will be better able to help you if he or she understands exactly what is happening.</p><p>To help with your problem, the doctor or nurse might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Switch you to medicines that are less likely to cause problems (or lower your dose)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggest hormones or medicines to improve sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggest lubricants or devices that can improve sex or arousal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommend that you speak to a counselor or therapist, either by yourself or with your partner</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874532\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I had a heart attack or other major health crisis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you had a heart attack or other health crisis, the idea of having sex might scare you. Many people who have had a heart attack or similar crisis can have sex safely afterward. Check with your doctor and follow his or her instructions. You will probably need to wait some time after your health crisis is over before you have sex. And you might need to change what you do during sex. But chances are good you will be able to have sex safely again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874547\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to improve my sex life?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Try to stay relaxed about your situation and work around the problems that limit you. Be open to trying new things and adapting.</p><p>If you have a condition that causes pain or stiffness, such as arthritis, try to schedule sex at a time when you are at your best and your pain medicines are most effective. If you are less flexible than you used to be, try different positions or ask your partner if he or she can help. Be open with your partner and explain what is going on with you. Also, encourage your partner to seek treatment for any physical or sexual problems he or she might have. That way the 2 of you can be at your best when you try to be intimate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10874562\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
