ART reduces HIV-related morbidity and mortality, even in individuals with high CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. An additional goal of ART in pregnant women is to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV infection. </p><p>In pregnant women, antiretroviral regimen selection should take into account the resistance profile of the virus, the safety and efficacy of the drugs in the mother and fetus, the convenience and adherence potential of the regimen, the potential for drug interactions with other medications, and pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy. In resource-rich settings, certain antiretroviral agents that are recommended in the general HIV-infected population are not preferred agents for pregnant women because of limited experience during pregnancy. On the other hand, certain agents that are not recommended in the general population are preferred for pregnant women because of extensive clinical experience during pregnancy. In general, treatment-na&iuml;ve women should be treated with a regimen made up of preferred agents, if the resistance profile of the virus allows. Treatment-experienced women on a suppressive antiretroviral regimen can continue it even if the agents are not specifically preferred during pregnancy. Preferred antiretroviral agents in pregnancy and regimen selection for pregnant women are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in resource-limited settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of ART generally outweigh the risk of adverse effects to the pregnant woman and her infant. With rare exception, the short-term data are reassuring. However, long-term data on the safety of in utero drug exposure in humans are not available for any antiretroviral drug, and it is possible that in utero exposure to antiretroviral agents could have delayed effects, as were ultimately identified with diethylstilbestrol (DES). Information on in utero antiretroviral exposure should be maintained in a child's medical record in case problems that could be long-term complications are identified in the future. </p><p>Clinicians are encouraged to contact the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry to prospectively report antiretroviral exposures in pregnancy to assist in monitoring pregnancy outcomes of pregnant women exposed to antiretroviral medications (1-800-258-4263 or <a href=\"http://www.apregistry.com/&amp;token=9KUHebAESu6RmEuHI4qh0YuNWvamNKG9npKsmsKdX04bNyex33RJEu89nNTONJ3l&amp;TOPIC_ID=3778\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.APRegistry.com</a>). The registry is a collaborative project of pharmaceutical manufacturers with an advisory committee of obstetric and pediatric practitioners. The registry is anonymous.

However, clinicians should be aware of and discuss with patients the potential risk for adverse pregnancy outcome with ART. Some, but not all, studies have suggested a small increase in the risk for preterm birth and impaired fetal growth. Of note, untreated maternal HIV infection itself has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Studies on teratogenicity have been overall reassuring but cannot rule out small increased risk in rare defects. For all these outcomes, further longitudinal data are warranted to clarify the risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98761395\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies evaluating the risk of combination antiretroviral agents during pregnancy on poor fetal growth and low birth weight have demonstrated conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. Similarly, studies evaluating maternal estradiol and progesterone levels, which can impact fetal growth and birth weight, and their association with antiretroviral agents have been conflicting. Two studies have reported an increase in estradiol in pregnant women receiving protease inhibitor-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. One of these studies reported a differential impact of drug class, with an increase of estradiol with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a> and a decrease with efavirenz-based therapy, and no effect on progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other studies have reported decreased progesterone levels in women receiving protease inhibitor-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Nevertheless, whether poor growth is due more to underlying maternal characteristics or to the medications themselves, some assessment of fetal growth is important in HIV-infected pregnancies. While some experts would rely on appropriate growth of uterine fundal height, others recommend ultrasound assessment in the third trimester to ensure adequate fetal growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings#H86989366\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal evaluation of the HIV-infected woman in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Prenatal fetal monitoring'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies of fetal growth effects associated with specific agents are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98761537\"><span class=\"h2\">Preterm birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may be an increased risk of preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation with combination antiretroviral regimens, particularly with those that contain protease inhibitors; data from prospective cohort studies are conflicting, while a large randomized trial conducted in resource-limited settings did find an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,19-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19-29</a>]. Even in those studies that demonstrate an increased risk with protease inhibitors, the increases are modest, and the effects on infant morbidity and mortality are unknown. Thus, given the clear benefits to maternal health and a reduction in perinatal transmission of HIV, certain protease inhibitors remain preferred antiretroviral agents for HIV-infected pregnant women in resource-rich settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings#H40726463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Approach for specific populations'</a>.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of studies evaluating pregnancy outcomes in HIV-infected women, use of any antiretroviral regimen was not associated with an increased risk for preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Compared with no antiretroviral use, however, a protease inhibitor-based regimen was associated with a small, non-significant trend towards increased preterm birth, which reached statistical significance when compared with other combination regimens that did not contain a protease inhibitor (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.70). In a subsequent trial comparing a protease inhibitor-containing combination ART regimen with a triple-nucleoside regimen, preterm (&lt;37 weeks) births were more frequent among women in the protease inhibitor group (24 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, there were no differences in infant hospitalizations or mortality rates through six months of age.</p><p>Similar results were reported in a subsequent randomized trial conducted in resource-limited settings that compared two protease inhibitor-containing combination ART regimens (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine-lamivudine</a> [zidovudine-ART arm] or tenofovir-emtricitabine [tenofovir-ART] arm) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> plus single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> (zidovudine-alone arm) among nearly 3500 HIV-infected pregnant women with CD4 cell counts &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Because of initial uncertainties about the safety of in utero exposure to tenofovir, during the first period of the trial (representing approximately 65 percent of enrollment), participants were randomly assigned only to zidovudine-ART or zidovudine alone unless they had HBV coinfection; during the second period of the trial, participants were randomly assigned to any one of the three arms, with approximately 350 women in each arm; comparisons among the three arms were limited to this second period of concurrent enrollment. Rates of preterm birth at &lt;37 weeks were higher with the combination regimens (20.5 percent with zidovudine-ART versus 13.1 percent with zidovudine during the combined first and second period of the trial, and 18.5 percent with tenofovir-ART versus 13.5 percent with zidovudine alone during the second period). Rates of very preterm birth at &lt;34 weeks and neonatal deaths, most of which occurred in very preterm infants, were not statistically higher with each of the combination ART regimens compared with zidovudine alone. However, during the second period of the trial, rates of very preterm delivery and neonatal deaths were both higher with tenofovir-ART (6.0 and 4.4 percent) compared with zidovudine-ART (2.6 and 0.6 percent). The vast majority of the neonatal deaths in the zidovudine-ART study arm occurred during the first period of the study, suggesting that these outcomes may have been unusually lower in the zidovudine-ART arm during the second period rather than abnormally high in the tenofovir-ART arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The risk of very preterm birth and neonatal death with tenofovir is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The prevalence was not different between women with first trimester exposure and those with initial antiretroviral exposure after the first trimester. These birth defect rates are comparable to the prevalence of birth defects reported in the United States (2.72 percent, according to surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Other studies have suggested that overall, first-trimester antiretroviral exposure is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

In a study of 428 HIV-exposed but uninfected children, there were no significant echocardiographic differences compared with 100 HIV-unexposed children. However, among exposed children with information on the timing of maternal antiretroviral exposure, exposures to various specific antiretroviral agents were associated with lower measures of left ventricular contractility and altered left ventricular dimensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms of mitochondrial toxicity in pregnant women taking NRTIs, which overlap with commonly-associated symptoms of pregnancy (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, fatigue). The hepatic lactic acidosis syndrome has similarities to the rare, but life-threatening, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets), which occurs in association with fatty liver during the third trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mitochondrial toxicity is a consequence of NRTI binding to mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, which leads to mitochondrial DNA depletion and dysfunction.

Two cases were also associated with fetal deaths. Due to these case reports, the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) has issued guidelines that didanosine and stavudine should not be used during pregnancy unless no other treatment options exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States and elsewhere, these agents are not recommended agents for adults and are rarely used.</p><p>There is also the risk of mitochondrial toxicity among infants whose mothers used NRTIs during pregnancy.

Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered as a potential etiology of neurologic abnormalities in children with past ART exposure, although the association is still not well defined. Early reports from France had suggested that exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> in utero was associated with significant mitochondrial dysfunction in infancy (with moderate to severe neurologic disease or mitochondrial toxicity associated with mortality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Additionally, in a study of 9127 HIV-uninfected French children who were followed for a median of 5.4 years, the overall incidence of cancer in these children (18.8 per 100,000 person years) did not differ significantly from that of the general population (10 cases observed versus 8.9 and 9.6 expected, depending on the reference period) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Although rates of very preterm delivery (&lt;34 weeks) and neonatal death (mostly associated with prematurity) were higher with TDF-based ART compared with zidovudine-based ART, rates of these outcomes were not statistically different when comparing TDF-based ART and zidovudine alone. Furthermore, the rates of very preterm delivery and neonatal death with zidovudine-based ART were disproportionately low during the second part of the trial, when comparisons were made with TDF-based ART, compared with the first part of the trial, when zidovudine-based ART was compared only with zidovudine alone (15 of 17 neonatal deaths in the zidovudine-ART group occurred during the first part of the trial, when two-thirds of study patients were enrolled) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

An additional goal is to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV infection. Overall, the known benefits of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women outweigh the known and potential risks. Nevertheless, decisions regarding ART in pregnant women are complex and need to take into consideration changes in pharmacokinetics and potential toxicities to the mother and fetus. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term data on the safety of in utero drug exposure in humans are not available for any antiretroviral drug; however, with rare exceptions, the short-term data are reassuring. Health professionals are encouraged to contact the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry to prospectively report antiretroviral exposures in pregnancy to assist in monitoring pregnancy outcomes of pregnant women exposed to antiretroviral medications. Information on in utero antiretroviral exposure should be maintained in a child's medical record in case problems that could be long-term complications are identified in the future.

Asymptomatic anemia and neutropenia have been reported in infants with in utero NRTI exposure.

Data on an association between in utero <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> exposure and congenital heart defects are inconsistent and also of unclear long-term significance.

Although protease inhibitors are associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance in general, most studies in pregnant woman do not indicate an increased rate of gestational diabetes with their use. Several studies that have suggested a small increased risk of preterm birth with combination ART have implicated protease inhibitors, but data are conflicting.
