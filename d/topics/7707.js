It is estimated that less than one-half of affected individuals will be diagnosed during their lifetime since the disease is often clinically silent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The genetics of ADPKD and the mechanisms of cyst growth will be reviewed here. Issues related to the diagnosis of and screening for ADPKD and for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, which is a disease of children, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in one of two genes, <em>PKD1</em> or <em>PKD2</em>, account for most cases of ADPKD. The two disease loci segregate independently since they reside on separate chromosomes. The <em>PKD1</em> gene is located on chromosome 16p13.3, and the <em>PKD2</em> gene is located on chromosome 4q21. (See <a href=\"#H164482583\" class=\"local\">'PKD1 and PKD2 genes'</a> below.)</p><p>There is evidence that the <em>PKD1</em> and <em>PKD2</em> disease loci can have synergistic effects. A family has been reported with bilineal inheritance, in which one parent had a mutation in <em>PKD1 </em>and the other parent had a mutation in <em>PKD2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The two family members with both mutations progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) approximately 20 years earlier than family members with only one <em>PKD1</em> or <em>PKD2</em> mutation.</p><p>A few families with ADPKD are not linked to either locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>A third ADPKD gene has not been identified. A study that re-evaluated five such families has shown that the absence of linkage was due to misdiagnosis, DNA contamination, and genotype errors and did not support the presence of a third gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On the other hand, at least five genes (ie, <em>ALG8</em>, <em>SEC 61B</em>, <em>SEC63</em>, <em>GANAB</em>, and <em>PRKCSH</em>) have been identified for autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), which can be associated with a very mild to mild kidney phenotype (ie, a few to multiple but not innumerable kidney cysts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Patients harboring mutations in one of these genes may be misdiagnosed with ADPKD but are not at risk for progressive chronic kidney disease.

Later reports found a lower incidence of <em>PKD1</em> of 86 percent in a study from Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and 74 percent in a study from Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A possible contributing factor to these later findings is that patients with <em>PKD2</em> have a <strong>later onset</strong> of clinically apparent disease than patients with <em>PKD1</em>, which can lead to delayed diagnosis. Macroscopic cysts occur later in <em>PKD2</em>, as do clinical findings such as hypertension, renal pain, and development of ESRD.

In contrast, maintenance of sufficient renal function to not require dialysis or the development of ESRD after 70 years of age in at least one affected family member was highly predictive of a <em>PKD2</em> mutation.

The median age of ESRD was 58.1 years in <em>PKD1</em> mutation carriers versus 79.7 years in those individuals with <em>PKD2</em> mutations. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis was approximately 10 years earlier in <em>PKD1</em> compared with <em>PKD2</em> (37 years versus 49 years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164482583\"><span class=\"h2\">PKD1 and PKD2 genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genes for both <em>PKD1</em> and <em>PKD2</em> have been identified.

The gene products, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, and their function are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'PKD gene products'</a> below.)</p><p>The <em>PKD1</em> gene is both a large and complex gene (46 exons). Exons 1 to 34, which comprise two-thirds of the coding sequence, are highly similar to several nearby genes, making it challenging to perform mutation screening in this &quot;duplicated&quot; region. In contrast, the <em>PKD2</em> gene is much smaller, and mutation screening of this gene is straightforward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The <em>PKD1</em> gene is adjacent to a disease gene for tuberous sclerosis (<em>TSC2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], a disorder that is characterized primarily by renal angiomyolipomas and renal cysts. Contiguous deletions of both the <em>PKD1</em> and <em>TSC2</em> genes cause a rare but severe form of PKD associated with ESRD that typically occurs in childhood or teenage years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

A large number of mutations have been described in both the <em>PKD1</em> and <em>PKD2</em> genes, with most mutations being unique to single families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>]. Most of these mutations are due to nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site alterations that are predicted to be protein truncating and inactivating. The clinical significance of up to one-third of the other <em>PKD1</em> mutations is less clear. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have been used for high-throughput mutation screening of both <em>PKD1</em> and <em>PKD2</em>, with a &quot;proof of principle&quot; study showing promising results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The adaptation of this new technology for molecular diagnostics in ADPKD has the potential to facilitate mutation screening at reduced costs.</p><p>There is variability in the renal manifestations of ADPKD. Some <em>PKD1</em> missense variants reduce, but do not abolish, <em>PKD1</em> activity and are called &quot;hypomorphic alleles.&quot; These alleles are associated with a milder form of ADPKD, similar to <em>PKD2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/16,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,29-31</a>]. On the other hand, the presence of a hypomorphic allele may modify disease severity in rare families with bilineal inheritance of two <em>PKD1</em> mutations (ie, one from each parent), resulting in prenatal PKD in the offspring who carry both <em>PKD1</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, within-family variability in ADPKD renal manifestations suggests a significant contribution from modifier genes, independent of the germline (inherited) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Identification of these modifiers is expected to be difficult since multiple genes are likely to be involved, each with only a modest effect size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The role of genetic factors in the rate of progression of ADPKD is discussed elsewhere.

The <em>PKD2</em> gene is much smaller (15 exons) and encodes polycystin-2, which is less than 1000 amino acids in length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Polycystin-1 undergoes a variety of cleavage events. Polycystin-1 undergoes a cleavage event at a juxtamembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) proteolytic site (GPS) motif. This cleavage does not require an exogenous protease and is therefore said to occur via &quot;cis-autoproteolysis.&quot; Cleavage at the GPS domain results in two fragments that remain noncovalently associated. This cleavage event is required to maintain tubular morphology since a knock-in mouse model with a mutation at the GPS site results in ADPKD with cysts primarily affecting the collecting duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. As another example, mechanical stimuli result in the intracellular release of the cytoplasmic tail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. This protein fragment is then translocated into the nuclei to activate transcriptional pathways such as activating protein-1 (AP-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/40,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42,43</a>]. One report suggests that the polycystin-1 cytoplasmic tail also translocates to the mitochondrial matrix where it could regulate mitochondrial structure and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Polycystin-2 is a calcium-permeable channel with six transmembrane (TM) spanning elements that is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of nonselective cation channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

A number of theories have been proposed, including weakening of tubular basement membranes and intratubular obstruction from hyperplastic cells. However, there has been little evidence to support these hypotheses. Furthermore, the observation that human PKD cells, but not normal renal epithelial cells, can form cysts when grown in culture suggests a genetic defect that directly promotes cyst formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p>Renal cysts in ADPKD are derived from different nephron segments, and the epithelial cells lining the cysts appear to retain their transport functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/63,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,66</a>].

It has been proposed that high-sodium cysts derive from the proximal tubule (particularly in cysts with a sodium concentration similar to that of plasma), while low-sodium cysts derive from the distal nephron (the site at which a low urine sodium concentration is normally achieved). However, careful histological examination has been unable to confirm these relationships since there is a continuum of cyst sodium concentrations, not just high or low values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Fluid secretion in the cysts may be mediated in part by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

In contrast, enlarging cysts lose their connection to functioning nephrons as they reach a size of more than 2 to 3 mm. Cyst growth in this setting results from secretion of fluid into the cysts (not glomerular filtration) and is associated with hyperplasia of the cyst epithelium that may reflect underlying maturational arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Human PKD cyst fluid, via an undefined mechanism, promotes both fluid secretion by a lipid secretagogue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] and cyst formation when added to renal tubular cells in culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Thus, cysts may form when there is loss of the normal haplotype in the presence of an abnormal <em>PKD1</em> gene. This concept is supported by the demonstration of both loss of heterozygosity and somatic (acquired not inherited) <em>PKD1</em> mutations within individual <em>PKD1</em> cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/70,71,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71,74</a>].</p><p>This model of cystogenesis has been questioned by some because of the low percentage (&lt;30 percent) of <em>PKD1</em> cysts that have loss of heterozygosity or somatic <em>PKD1</em> gene mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A possible explanation is that only the nonduplicated region of <em>PKD1</em> is easily screened for intragenic mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. As mentioned above, exons 1 to 34, which comprise two-thirds of the coding sequence, are highly similar to several nearby genes, making it challenging to perform mutation screening in this &quot;duplicated&quot; region (see <a href=\"#H164482583\" class=\"local\">'PKD1 and PKD2 genes'</a> above). By comparison, when the entire <em>PKD2</em> gene is screened, approximately 80 percent of renal and liver cysts from individuals with germline (inherited) <em>PKD2</em> mutations have inactivating <em>PKD2</em> somatic mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/73,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence in support of the &quot;second-hit&quot; hypothesis comes from studies in murine models.

As an example, a dose of functional polycystin that falls below a critical threshold (approximately 10 to 30 percent of normal) within a tubular epithelial cell may be sufficient to initiate cyst formation. It has been proposed that falling below this threshold leads to abnormal fluid secretion, dysregulated cell proliferation, and apoptosis, which promote cyst growth via multiple signaling pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/20,63,65,78,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,63,65,78,80,81</a>].</p><p>The time at which the <em>PKD1</em> gene is inactivated is another factor that may modify renal disease severity, which suggests the existence of a developmental switch.

These protein products include polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in ADPKD, fibrocystin in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, and the nephronophthisis gene products.

One possibility is that the inability to sense fluid flow by the defective polycystin complex may result in reduced intracellular calcium flux, which then stimulates cAMP signaling, causing dysregulated cyst growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One study calls this hypothesis into question since depletion of PC2 in the cilia of retinal pigment epithelial cells does not alter ciliary calcium currents measured by direct patch clamp methods. However, depletion of polycystin homologs, PKD2L1 and PKD1 L1, which interact with one another, appear to mediate ciliary calcium currents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'PKD gene products'</a> above). One line of evidence suggesting that polycystins may act as ciliary sensors comes from the finding that <em>PKD2</em> mutant mice have situs inversus, a phenotype that is classically associated with ciliary function in the embryonic node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>The connection between cilia, growth, and PKD is complex. Mutations in genes involved in ciliary assembly such as TG737 and Kif3a result in PKD in mice. Studies using a combination of mutations in mice have shown that deleting cilia unexpectedly suppresses cyst growth. One explanation is that cyst growth is dependent on intact cilia. When cilia are deleted in the absence of polycystins, growth is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

The centrosome, in turn, may have a significant role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and control, with abnormalities in the <span class=\"nowrap\">cilia/centrosome</span> apparatus possibly resulting in abnormal cellular proliferation.

Fewer than one-half of cases are diagnosed during the patient's lifetime as the disease is frequently clinically silent. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple causative genetic defects have been described, most of which are within the <em>PKD1</em> locus on chromosome 16, resulting in ADPKD1 disease. A smaller number of patients have a defect in the <em>PKD2</em> locus on chromosome 4 (resulting in ADPKD2 disease), and a few families have neither <em>PKD1</em> nor <em>PKD2</em> mutations. (See <a href=\"#H249734786\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of PKD1 and PKD2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>PKD1</em> and <em>PKD2</em> encode proteins called polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H164482583\" class=\"local\">'PKD1 and PKD2 genes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystin-1 is a membrane protein localized at sites of cyst formation, including renal tubular epithelia, hepatic bile ductules, and pancreatic ducts. Possible roles of polycystin-1 include the regulation of protein-protein, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions and of intracellular signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. (See <a href=\"#H23546035\" class=\"local\">'Polycystin localization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23546596\" class=\"local\">'Polycystin function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystin-2 is expressed in the distal tubules, collecting duct, and thick ascending limb and is involved in cell calcium signaling. (See <a href=\"#H23546035\" class=\"local\">'Polycystin localization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23546596\" class=\"local\">'Polycystin function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 also interact in common pathways and function together as an important regulator of calcium influx as a nonselective calcium ion channel. (See <a href=\"#H23546596\" class=\"local\">'Polycystin function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism by which cysts form is unclear. Cyst formation may result from multiple aberrant processes including abnormal fluid secretion and cell proliferation and apoptosis. Early cysts begin as dilatations in intact tubules that are in contact with the nephron. However, enlarging cysts lose their connection to functioning nephrons. Cyst growth in this setting results from secretion of fluid into the cysts and is associated with hyperplasia of the cyst epithelium. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of cyst formation and growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the inheritance of an abnormal <em>PKD1</em> gene, cysts appear to form only when there is a second, acquired somatic loss of the normal haplotype; this is referred to as the second-hit hypothesis. More recent data suggest a &quot;threshold mechanism&quot; whereby functional polycystin levels below a critical threshold (ie, 10 to 30 percent) within a tubular epithelial cell may trigger the cystogenic process. As a result, although the genetic defect is present in all cells, cysts form in &lt;10 percent of tubules, and cystic dilatation is focal within tubules. (See <a href=\"#H17678992\" class=\"local\">'Focal cyst formation and the 'second hit' hypothesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevations in cyclic AMP (cAMP) related to decreased intracellular calcium signaling may enhance cyst formation by increasing fluid secretion and cell proliferation. Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, increases in the intracellular calcium concentration, and calcimimetics all may decrease cyst growth. Aberrant activation of mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway may also enhance renal cyst growth. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Role of cyclic AMP and intracellular calcium'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29439722\" class=\"local\">'Role of mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiogenesis may contribute to cyst growth. (See <a href=\"#H17679141\" class=\"local\">'Angiogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in renal cilia function contribute to renal cyst formation in animal models, possibly by decreasing the ability of renal epithelium to sense luminal flow rates. The role of defective planar cell polarity in ADPKD is controversial, with conflicting experimental data. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal cilia function and cell planar polarity'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Davies F, Coles GA, Harper PS, et al.
