As many as 50,000 to 70,000 adults die annually of pneumonia and influenza in the United States, which could be greatly reduced with vaccinations. Receiving appropriate immunizations plays a crucial role in protecting health throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime.</p><p>The following is a general discussion of vaccines currently recommended for healthy adults. Separate articles discuss vaccines for international travelers and children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?

When a person's immune system recognizes a foreign organism (bacterium, virus), it responds by creating proteins called antibodies. Antibodies fight the infection and help the person to recover.</p><p>Antibodies also work to prevent a person from becoming ill in the future. The next time a person is exposed to the organism, the immune system recognizes it and rapidly produces the antibodies required to destroy the organism. This response protects the individual from developing the disease, ideally for life. For example, a person who had chickenpox as a child is unlikely to develop it again, even if he or she is in close contact with a person who is infected.</p><p>Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. However, unlike bacteria and viruses, vaccines do not cause the person to become ill in order to develop these antibodies. There are two main types of immunizations: active and passive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Active vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active vaccines use a weakened form of the harmful bacteria or virus or components of the bacteria or virus to stimulate the immune system. Some active vaccines are called live vaccines because they are made from a weakened form of the bacterium or virus.</p><p>Some bacteria (eg, diphtheria, tetanus) cause illness because they produce a harmful substance in the body called toxins. Vaccines that help the immune system protect the body from toxins are called toxoids. Toxoids are made from weakened forms of the toxins of bacteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Passive vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passive vaccines provide temporary immunity with antibodies obtained from a large pool of donors; this preparation is known as immune serum globulin. Passive vaccines offer short-term protection to children or adults who have been exposed to a specific organism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccines protect children and adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people are concerned about the risks of vaccines. However, vaccines have a long record of being a safe and effective way of preventing disease. In most cases, the benefits of vaccinating are much greater than the potential risks. Diseases such as diphtheria and measles are uncommon in developed countries such as the United States. However, these illnesses are still common in developing countries.</p><p>It is easy for illness to spread to children or adults who are not vaccinated because immigrants and visitors can travel from affected areas. Vaccines help to reduce a child's, family's, and even an entire community's chances of becoming ill by decreasing the number of people who become sick and transmit the infection to other people. This process is sometimes referred to as &quot;herd immunity.&quot;</p><p>An example of a successful vaccine program is smallpox. Before a vaccine was available, smallpox killed millions of people every year. As a result of an intensive vaccination program, smallpox has been completely eliminated throughout the world.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">How are vaccines given?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most immunizations are given to adults in the form of an injection into the upper arm. Some vaccines are also given in other ways, such as by mouth or as a nasal spray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most vaccines are safe and cause few if any serious side effects. Very rarely, serious side effects do occur. People who are vaccinated and then develop symptoms that could be related to the vaccine should contact their healthcare provider. There is a national Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS, <a href=\"http://vaers.hhs.gov/index&amp;token=dJuRidyjQYZxq9fkueW6qyWTvn/p9jDJLlDYcIYjX1yIn9pmTuN0f+LI7X4NwNtw&amp;TOPIC_ID=4003\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://vaers.hhs.gov/index</a>, telephone number 1-800-822-7967), which can be consulted if necessary. Occasionally, recommendations for a vaccine are changed in response to this type of report.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With many vaccines and toxoids, side effects can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reddish, tender area at the site of injection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, a &quot;serum sickness-like&quot; reaction that may be characterized by fever, skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe side effects of vaccines are rare but may include a severe neurologic reaction (eg, seizures) or severe allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis). Allergic reactions usually occur within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine. If this occurs in the healthcare provider's office, emergency care can be given immediately. If a severe reaction occurs later, the person or a family member should call emergency medical services, available in most areas of the United States by calling 911.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Reasons to avoid vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A particular vaccine may not be recommended for people with a serious allergic reaction to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eggs or egg protein, since some vaccines are prepared with embryonic chicken eggs or cultures (eg, influenza vaccine, yellow fever vaccine). A mild allergy to eggs does <strong>not</strong> mean that the vaccine should be avoided. There is a type of influenza vaccine (recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine) that is safe for people with a serious allergic reaction to eggs because the vaccine is not prepared using eggs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antibiotic medications neomycin or streptomycin (some vaccines contains trace amounts of neomycin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gelatin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A specific vaccine</p><p/><p>In addition, live virus vaccines, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the varicella vaccine are generally not recommended for the following groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a weakened immune system, since there is an increased risk of infection as a result of the vaccination</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have recently received a blood transfusion or immune serum globulin, which can delay the normal response to active vaccination. In this case, the vaccination should be delayed for one month.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant within the next 28 days, due to the potential risk of the vaccine to the developing fetus</p><p/><p>In some cases, there is an alternative vaccine that is not live that can be used. For example, the injectable form of the influenza vaccine is not live and is recommended for those who cannot receive live vaccines, such as pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Conditions that do not affect vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following conditions do not require that a person delay or avoid vaccination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current or recent mild illness, with or without low grade fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current or recent antibiotic therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous mild to moderate tenderness, redness, or swelling at the site of injection or fever less than 104.9&ordm;F (40.5&ordm;C) after any previous vaccination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A personal history of allergies, except those listed above</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of adverse reactions to vaccines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINE RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood vaccinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, children should begin receiving vaccinations at birth. This allows the child to be protected from common childhood illnesses as well as illnesses that can develop during adulthood. Many diseases prevented by vaccines are more serious in young children.</p><p>In addition, most infants visit a healthcare provider frequently during the first year, which improves the chances of completing most vaccines that require multiple doses. In most states, some vaccines are required before the child can attend school; these requirements vary from one state to another.</p><p>The recommended vaccine schedules for children and adolescents in the United States are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82617%7EPEDS%2F58209\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82617 graphicRef58209 \">figure 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, immunizations are recommended for healthy adults based upon policies developed by expert groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 2</a>).

Pneumonia is usually caused by bacteria; the most common is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, or pneumococcus. Pneumococcal pneumonia can develop as a complication of a respiratory tract viral infection such as influenza. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pneumococcal vaccines protect against many of the types of pneumococci. More detailed information about the pneumococcal vaccines is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-prevention-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commonly known as flu, influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that occurs in outbreaks worldwide, usually in the winter season in the United States and other nontropical regions. Serious complications can develop in people with influenza, including bacterial pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A vaccine to prevent influenza is recommended for nearly all adults. These vaccines are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus is a wound infection caused by a bacterial toxin. The bacterium resides in soil and the intestinal tracts of certain mammals and enters the body through a wound; it then multiplies and produces toxins that act on nerves controlling muscle activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diphtheria is a sudden illness caused by a bacterium that is usually transmitted via droplets coughed or sneezed into the air. The bacteria typically multiply in the throat and may release a toxin into the bloodstream, which can lead to damage of the brain and heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an upper respiratory illness caused by a bacterium called <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>. The bacterium is spread easily and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and people with a weakened immune system.</p><p/><p>Tetanus and diphtheria are rare in the United States because most infants are given a series of five vaccinations, starting at two months of age. Some people have an increased risk of developing tetanus or diphtheria, including people who were not vaccinated during childhood, older adults (due to a decline in protection from the vaccine over time), people who live in rural areas, injection drug users, and immigrants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pertussis has become increasingly common in adults, despite the fact that most people were immunized during childhood. This is due to fading immunity to pertussis over time.</p><p>A tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster vaccine is recommended for all adults every 10 years for life. Adults under age 65 who have not had the combined tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine (Tdap) should get one dose of Tdap instead of their next regular tetanus booster (Td), followed by the Td booster every 10 years. Adults aged 65 years or older who are healthcare workers or who have close contact with infants under one year of age (eg, grandparents, childcare providers) should get a single dose of Tdap as soon as they can, regardless of how long ago they had a tetanus booster. Adults over age 65 who do not have close contact with infants can also receive a single dose of Tdap. If the booster dose is overdue and there is concern that the person was exposed to tetanus, tetanus immune globulin is given along with the Td or Tdap. The immune globulin provides temporary protection from the toxin. A series of three tetanus-diphtheria vaccines, one of which includes acellular pertussis (Tdap), is recommended for adults who did not receive any of the childhood diphtheria-tetanus vaccines. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Passive vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measles, mumps, and rubella are transmitted by infected patients who release airborne droplets while coughing or sneezing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measles is a highly contagious viral illness of the respiratory tract that primarily affects children; it causes a distinctive rash, fever, and cough and may result in complications, including infection of the middle ear and lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mumps, an acute, usually mild viral infection of childhood, is primarily characterized by painful swelling of the salivary glands; however, complications may sometimes result, including inflammation of the protective membranes of the brain (meningitis) and, in males affected after puberty, swelling and tenderness of one or both testes (orchitis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rubella, also known as German measles, is typically a mild viral infection characterized by fever, swelling of the lymph nodes, and rash; however, it can cause severe birth defects (congenital rubella syndrome) if the mother is affected during early pregnancy.</p><p/><p>The incidence of these diseases fell dramatically in the United States since the live virus vaccine was developed. Despite the rarity of the diseases in the United States, continued protection of children as well as adults is recommended for a number of reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases of measles brought from other countries have the potential to be a major source of future exposure unless the population remains immune.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with measles have an increased risk of death. Measles during pregnancy can cause early labor and miscarriage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most serious complications of mumps occur more frequently in adults than children, including orchitis (leading to sterility in men), neurologic complications, and risk of fetal death if the infection is acquired in early pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccination can help to eliminate the most important consequences of rubella, including miscarriage, fetal death, and congenital rubella syndrome.</p><p/><p>A series of MMR vaccines is given to most infants and children in the United States. People who were born before 1957 in the United States are usually considered to be immune to measles and mumps. If you are not sure that you had measles, mumps and rubella or whether you were vaccinated against these diseases, a blood test can verify immunity. If you are not immune to measles or mumps or rubella (ie, to one or more of the three diseases), the MMR vaccine is recommended.</p><p>There are no adverse consequences of receiving MMR if you are already immune to one or more of the three diseases. High-risk groups include women who could become pregnant, college students, healthcare workers, and international travelers. If you are in one of these high-risk groups and are not immune to measles, mumps, or rubella, you should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine. If you are not in one of these high-risk groups and are not immune to measles, mumps, or rubella, you should receive one dose of MMR. However, MMR should <strong>not</strong> be administered to pregnant women or women considering pregnancy in the next 28 days.</p><p>If there is an outbreak of mumps in the community, experts recommend that people who were not previously vaccinated get the mumps vaccine. Also, if you received the two-dose vaccine in the past, your doctor may suggest that you get a third dose in the setting of an outbreak. This can help protect you against mumps, particularly if it has been a long time since you initially received the vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Varicella (chickenpox)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chickenpox is a highly contagious viral illness caused by infection with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The disease causes fever, sore throat, and a distinctive, itchy, blistering rash that later forms scabs. The virus is transmitted by airborne droplets or direct contact with the skin rash. Chickenpox is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two doses of varicella vaccine are needed, with the second dose administered four to eight weeks after the first. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next month and those with a history of anaphylactic reactions to neomycin or gelatin should not receive the varicella vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Herpes zoster (shingles)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpes zoster (also known as shingles) is caused by varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After an episode of chickenpox, the virus lingers in cells of the nervous system, where it can reside quietly for decades. However, later in life, the varicella-zoster virus can become active again. When it reactivates, it causes shingles. Shingles can occur in individuals of all ages, but it is uncommon in children, adolescents, and young adults. It is much more common in adults aged 50 years and older and in those whose immune system has been weakened. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shingles-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Shingles (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two vaccines that have been approved for adults 50 years of age or older to reduce the chance of developing shingles. If you do develop shingles after receiving the vaccine, your infection may be less severe and you are less likely to develop postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication of shingles. It causes mild to severe pain or unpleasant sensations and is often described as &quot;burning.&quot;</p><p>Both vaccines are given as shots; one form comes in a single dose, while a newer form requires two doses (given two to six months apart). Your doctor can help you decide whether you should get a shingles vaccine and, if so, which form is most appropriate for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) is caused by infection with certain viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV). Although the infection often resolves or is asymptomatic (does not cause symptoms), HBV can result in chronic infection that can lead to progressive liver scarring (cirrhosis) or liver cancer. HBV is transmitted by contact with an infected individual's body fluids, such as during unprotected sexual intercourse, the sharing of contaminated needles during injection drug use, or contact with contaminated blood or blood products. HBV can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her baby. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis B (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 100,000 people, mostly adults, are infected with HBV each year in the United States. Although the overall lifetime risk of acquiring HBV is only about 5 percent for the average person, the risk increases to almost 100 percent in the highest risk groups.</p><p>A vaccine is available that protects against HBV. HBV vaccination is now recommended for all children in early childhood or as a &quot;catch-up&quot; immunization during early adolescence. In addition, any adult who is at risk for HBV infection should receive the HBV vaccine. The vaccine is usually given in three doses, with the second and third doses given one month and six months after the first dose.</p><p>Adults who should receive the HBV vaccine include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthcare and public safety workers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personnel in institutions caring for the developmentally disabled and employees and inmates of correctional facilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Household contacts and sex partners of people with chronic HBV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with multiple sex partners, people with sexually transmitted diseases, and men who have sex with men</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who inject street drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who require blood clotting factors or kidney dialysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People from countries where HBV is consistently present (endemic) and certain international travelers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with diabetes who are between ages 19 and 59</p><p/><p>People with anaphylactic reactions to yeast should not receive HBV vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis due to infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of the most common viral infections in children and adolescents in the United States. HAV infection often causes few or no symptoms in children. By contrast, infection in adults can vary in severity from a mild flu-like illness to rapidly progressive, severe hepatitis. Vaccinating children can help to protect adult caregivers from a potentially serious illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis A (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HAV is found in the stool of infected individuals. A person can become infected with HAV by consuming contaminated food or water or by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes after touching a contaminated surface (eg, in the bathroom or during a diaper change). Washing the hands can help to prevent infection.</p><p>Vaccines are available to prevent infection with HAV.

The bacteria lives on surfaces of the nose and pharynx (wind pipe) and is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with respiratory secretions. Although meningococcal disease is easily treated in most people, 10 to 14 percent of people die from the infection.</p><p>Meningococcal vaccines are available to prevent infection. Expert groups recommend a meningococcal vaccine for all adolescents, college freshmen living in dormitories, military recruits, travelers going to areas where meningococcal disease frequently occurs, microbiologists who are exposed to <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, people who have had their spleen removed or whose spleen does not work properly, and people with terminal complement deficiency.
