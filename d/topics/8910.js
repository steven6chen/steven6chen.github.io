The term is often used synonymously with smoke inhalation injury. Inhalation injury resulting from fire remains one of the leading causes of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, initial management, subsequent management, and special considerations of inhalation injury are reviewed here. The emergency care of thermal burns is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11364127\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Annually in the United States, an estimated 372,900 fires in residential buildings result in an average of 2530 deaths, 13,125 injuries, and $7 billion (USD) in property loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pulmonary complications following burns and inhalation injury are responsible for up to 77 percent of the deaths, among which the majority are due to carbon monoxide poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Inhalation injury is common following burn injury and increases in incidence with the size of the burn injury and age of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In addition, inhalation injury has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11364133\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation injury can affect the airways as well as result in systemic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The location and severity of injury depends on several factors, including the ignition source, the size and diameter of the particles in the smoke, the duration of the exposure, and the solubility of the gases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Direct toxin damage is caused by the lower-molecular-weight constituents of smoke because of their pH, ability to form free radicals, and ability to reach the distal airways and alveoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Based upon the primary localization of the insult, inhalation injury is classified into injuries of the upper airway, the tracheobronchial system, or the lung parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11364139\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper airway injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The leading injury in the upper airway (above the vocal cords) is thermal injury due to the efficient heat exchange in the oro- and nasopharynx. The immediate injury results in erythema, ulcerations, and edema. In combined burn and inhalation injury, aggressive fluid administration required to treat burn shock promotes early edema formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, burns to the face and neck may cause anatomic distortion or external compression of the upper airway, complicating airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition to the acute inflammation, damage of ciliary function impairs physiological clearance processes of the airway, leading to an increased risk of bacterial infection for several weeks. Furthermore, the increased production of thick secretions can cause distal airway obstruction, atelectasis, and impaired gas exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11364145\"><span class=\"h2\">Tracheobronchial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exception of inhalation of steam, injury to the tracheobronchial tree (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076 \">figure 1</a>) is usually caused by chemicals in smoke. However, toxic inhalation of noxious gases (eg, chlorine), liquids (eg, acid), and direct airway fire (eg, intraoperative) can also be associated with a similar process. Clinical symptoms include persistent coughing and wheezing, soot-containing airway secretions (ie, melanoptysis), increased work of breathing resulting in hypoventilation, erythema, hyperemia, and increased pulmonary shunting from lobar collapse or atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>]. </p><p>The tracheobronchial area is richly innervated by vasomotor and sensory nerve endings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>]. Smoke inhalation stimulates these nerves to release neuropeptides. These neuropeptides then induce bronchoconstriction and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-23</a>]. These neuropeptides can function as tachykinins, inducing an inflammatory response with the downstream effects of bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These factors potentiate local cellular damage and the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which causes bronchial blood flow to increase manyfold. In addition, the increased bronchial blood flow delivers activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cytokines to the lung, increasing the host inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Furthermore, the loss of an intact bronchial epithelium and the effects of ROS result in a loss of plasma proteins and fluid from the intravascular space into the alveoli and bronchioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The transvascular shift of protein results in exudate and cast formation within the airways, leading to alveolar collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. These processes contribute to ventilation-perfusion mismatch as a primary mechanism of hypoxemia following the inhalation injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11364151\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenchymal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage to the lung parenchyma is delayed. The time difference from the initial injury to the occurrence of a decrease in arterial oxygen tension to inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio (PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio) is correlated with the severity of the lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>]. A faster time is associated with more severe injury. Injury to the lung parenchyma is characterized by atelectasis and alveolar collapse resulting in increased transvascular fluid flux, a decrease in surfactant, and a loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction and therefore impaired oxygenation. Furthermore, a severe imbalance in alveolar hemostasis and decreased fibrinolytic activity, with massive fibrin deposition in the airways, causes a ventilation-perfusion mismatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26</a>]. </p><p>Airway obstruction and atelectasis increases the risk for pneumonia. The risk for pneumonia is increased because of the impaired function of alveolar macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and mucociliary clearance mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11364157\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct systemic effect of inhalation injury is caused by breathing toxic substances formed via combustion or pyrolysis. The two most relevant gases associated with increased morbidity and mortality are carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carbon monoxide poisoning</strong> &ndash; Carbon monoxide is one of the most frequent immediate causes of death following inhalation injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,30</a>]. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas with an affinity for hemoglobin more than 200 times higher than that of oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Carboxyhemoglobin shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, impairing release of oxygen at the tissues and utilization of oxygen in mitochondria, leading to tissue hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The table shows signs and symptoms at various concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F106164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106164 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Carbon monoxide poisoning should be suspected in all patients who present following inhalation injury or house fires until it is excluded by a normal blood carboxyhemoglobin level. Pulse oximetry cannot screen for carbon monoxide exposure, as it does not differentiate carboxyhemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin levels are measured with CO-oximetry on arterial or venous blood. Treatment indications are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60672\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60672 \">table 2</a>).

Cyanide poisoning is difficult to confirm during the initial postburn period because the symptoms are nonspecific and cyanide levels cannot be measured soon enough to be clinically meaningful. Given the high probability of its presence at a fire scene, cyanide toxicity should be considered in every patient with an inhalation injury. Treatment for cyanide poisoning should be considered in any patient being treated for smoke inhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65052 \">table 3</a>). Treatment can be initiated in those at risk who display depressed level of consciousness, cardiac arrest, or cardiac decompensation in the absence of laboratory confirmation.

Pertinent information includes exposure to flame, smoke, or chemicals; duration of exposure; exposure in an enclosed space; and a history of loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/23,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33</a>].</p><p>Generalized symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, or vomiting may be reported.

Most patients with inhalation injury have a normal chest radiograph at presentation, and for those with abnormal findings, the degree of injury is usually underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/11,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,36</a>].

For those at risk of developing oxygen-induced hypercapnia (eg, patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive sleep apnea), a low threshold to treat the patient with noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation is prudent. Tissue hypoxia is multifactorial and can quickly lead to death. Hypoxia is due, in part, to the inspiration of air with an FiO<sub>2</sub> &lt;15 percent during the fire (fire consumes ambient oxygen) and is also related to impaired delivery and utilization of oxygen by the tissues from carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>]. Carbon monoxide poisoning should be presumed in any patient who presents following smoke inhalation until it is excluded by a normal carboxyhemoglobin.

Loss of an airway in patients with burns and inhalation injury can be catastrophic. The anesthesiologist, surgeon, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> critical care physician should decide the most appropriate method of airway management either by endotracheal intubation or placement of a tracheostomy. The proper size (preferably &gt;7.5 cm outer diameter to allow secretion clearance and the passage of a bronchoscope), tube placement, and stabilization technique are all important considerations. The most experienced provider available should establish and secure the airway. The security of the tube needs to be checked frequently as airway edema increases or decreases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endotracheal intubation is frequently used as a supportive therapy in the management of inhalation injury. In one reported series, up to 80 percent of patients with inhalation injury required intubation for at least short-term management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Some patients will ultimately require tracheostomy. (See <a href=\"#H1502541819\" class=\"local\">'Tracheostomy'</a> below.)</p><p>A decision for early intubation should be based upon any of the following signs: deep burns to the face or neck, blisters or edema of the oropharynx, stridor, use of accessory muscles, respiratory distress, sub- and suprasternal retractions, or hypoventilation. Intubated patients with concern for carbon monoxide poisoning should also be placed on humidified 100 percent oxygen until carboxyhemoglobin levels normalize. Humidified oxygen helps to avoid the development of inspissated secretions. The American Burn Association's Advanced Life Support protocol suggests that if there is any question about the security of the patient's airway, the patient should be intubated prior to transfer to a trauma or burn center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The endotracheal tube can be removed, if indicated, once the patient has been safely transported. </p><p>Intubation for altered mental status, imminent airway obstruction, or respiratory failure may be indicated subsequently during the hospital course since the development of upper airway inflammation and edema may be delayed by 24 hours and lower airway edema delayed by 36 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Other reasons for needing intubation include complications that develop during the hospital course, such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pulmonary toilet, and for operative procedures. Changing the endotracheal tube and reintubation for unplanned extubation are dangerous in the presence of upper airway edema, and aggressive monitoring to ensure airway security is essential to avoid problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2963368663\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial stabilization and transfer to the intensive care unit, treatment for inhalation injury is mainly supportive. Patients are monitored during the subsequent one to five days for the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway inflammation and systemic toxicity &ndash; In the early phase (&lt;36 hours), treatment is focused on treating systemic toxicity (carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide) and managing early airway edema and bronchospasm. After inhalation injury, upper and lower airway inflammation may result in increased airway edema, mucosal slough, and cast formation, which result in impaired gas exchange. These are managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet and may require therapeutic bronchoscopies.

However, NAC is also an airway irritant and may produce bronchoconstriction. A bronchodilator should be added if wheezing or bronchospasm occurs with NAC treatment. Generally a NAC dose of 3 mL of a 20% solution every four hours is used. </p><p>The combination of NAC and aerosolized heparin has been shown to be effective for the treatment of inhalation injury in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Vigilance and frequent clinical assessments are warranted.</p><p>The threshold for intubation needs to be lower in pediatric patients due to the potential for rapid development of airway edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Endotracheal tube size needs to be specifically tailored for the pediatric patient with inhalation injury. Due to their anatomy, the chance of accidental extubation is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Endotracheal tube security is essential to maintaining a patent airway. Loss of an airway in this population can result in airway compromise and potentially be fatal. An emergency airway box with appropriate-sized equipment is recommended to be kept at the bedside. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11364316\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults over 65 years of age have a mortality from burns that is six times the national average [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Due to lower physiological reserves and comorbidities, treatment of this patient population presents a unique challenge. A number of existing risk factors are present in older adults. These include increased risk of infections, pulmonary diseases, and comorbidities. Older adults have a decrease in pulmonary reserve, lung mechanics, and a decreased lean body mass, as well as coronary artery disease. Additionally, pneumonia and urinary tract infections are the most prevalent complications in older adult burn patients. Treatment options are identical to younger patients, keeping in mind the physiological differences due to aging and comorbidities. No evidence supports changing treatment protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1440177337\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhalation injury other than smoke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the optimal management strategy is unknown, patients with inhalation injury due to agents other than smoke are typically managed in the same fashion as for smoke in inhalation, with the exception of monitoring for carbon monoxide poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H419769858\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation injury is an independent predictor of mortality in burn patients. Pulmonary-related complications following burns and inhalation injury are responsible for up to 77 percent of the deaths, most of which are related to carbon monoxide poisoning. In a review that identified 769 patients with smoke inhalation-related acute lung injury, the in-hospital mortality rate was 26 percent, and among those with associated severe burns (&gt;20 percent total body surface area [TBSA]), it was 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In addition to severe associated burns, other clinical factors associated with in-hospital mortality included burn age &gt;60 years and vasopressor use. </p><p>The National Burn Repository of the American Burn Association found that patients with inhalation injury had a higher case fatality for a given Baux score (age+total burn surface area) compared with those with no inhalation injury, but the added risk was not constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. As an example, the presence of inhalation injury increases mortality nearly 24-fold for burn patients under the age of 60 with a total burned surface area &lt;20 percent. From another study, the mortality of burn patients increased by 20 percent in the presence of smoke inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Inhalation injury also causes systemic toxicity owing to toxic gases (eg, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide). About one-third of patients with burn injuries have a concomitant inhalation injury. Pulmonary-related complications following burns and inhalation injury are responsible for up to 77 percent of deaths related to burn injury. (See <a href=\"#H11364121\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11364127\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H419769858\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon monoxide poisoning should be presumed in any patient who presents following smoke inhalation until it is excluded by a normal carboxyhemoglobin level on CO-oximetry. The initial approach to presumed carbon monoxide poisoning involves administering supplemental oxygen at FiO<sub>2</sub> of 100 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3952639976\" class=\"local\">'Initial care and disposition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11364157\" class=\"local\">'Systemic toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early intubation is justified for any patient with suspected inhalation injury and signs of respiratory distress (stridor, use of accessory respiratory muscles), hypoxemia, hypoventilation, deep burns to the face or neck, or blistering or edema of the oropharynx. (See <a href=\"#H1515959447\" class=\"local\">'Securing the airway'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation and initial management of accompanying trauma or burn injuries is prioritized using Advanced Trauma Life Support protocols. Transfer to a burn center should be initiated for patients with inhalation injury and burns who meet the American Burn Association referral criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3952639976\" class=\"local\">'Initial care and disposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with clinical features suspicious for inhalation injury, such as a history of smoke exposure in an enclosed space, and physical findings (eg, facial burns, singed nasal vibrissae, soot in the oropharynx, nasal passages, and proximal airways), we use bronchoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of inhalation injury. (See <a href=\"#H835805907\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper airway management is critical in patients with inhalation injury. Endotracheal intubation is frequently used as a supportive therapy in the management of inhalation injury. Loss of an airway in patients with burns and inhalation injury can be catastrophic. The most experienced practitioner available should establish and secure the airway. Tube security needs to be checked frequently as swelling increases or decreases. (See <a href=\"#H3952639976\" class=\"local\">'Initial care and disposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inpatient management of patients with inhalation injury treatment is mainly supportive and consists of monitoring the patient for subsequent development of airway compromise. Upper airway problems tend to occur within 24 hours of inhalation injury and are managed by intubation until the upper edema subsides, while lower airway compromise tends to occur later (one to three days after injury). (See <a href=\"#H2818746189\" class=\"local\">'Supportive treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aerosolized bronchodilators are effective in several ways and should be given when wheezing or bronchospasm occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F106166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106166 \">table 6</a>). Bronchodilators relax bronchial muscle, stimulate mucociliary clearance, decrease airflow resistance, and improve dynamic compliance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clearing the airways is an essential component in the management of patients with inhalation injury. This can be achieved with a combination of inhaled pharmacologic agents (N-acetylcysteine, heparin) and mechanical means, such as therapeutic coughing, chest physiotherapy, airway suctioning, early ambulation, and, if necessary, intubation with suctioning or therapeutic bronchoscopy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation of patients with inhalation injury should begin with low tidal volumes (6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> adjusting them based upon the patient's condition, compliance, airway resistance, and tolerance. There is no consensus on the optimal mode of mechanical ventilation, but if the patient develops acute respiratory distress syndrome, a lung-protective strategy should be used. Assessing readiness for extubation and daily weaning trials should be evaluated every morning, and the patient should be removed from mechanical ventilation as soon as <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> meets criteria. (See <a href=\"#H11364273\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients do not suffer long-term respiratory impairment following smoke inhalation; however, although rare, residual long-term sequelae may include tracheal stenosis, bronchiectasis, interstitial fibrosis reactive airway disease, and bronchiolitis obliterans. These are usually associated with severe injury.
