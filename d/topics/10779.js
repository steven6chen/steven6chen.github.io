Your doctor might also prescribe these same medicines after a TIA (also called a &quot;mini-stroke&quot;). People who have TIAs are at very high risk of having a full-blown stroke, so medicines to prevent strokes are important for them, too. (TIA stands for &quot;transient ischemic attack.&quot;)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9352072\"><span class=\"h1\">How do medicines help prevent strokes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some strokes happen when small arteries in the brain close off because they have been damaged by high blood pressure. Other strokes happen when blood clots form inside the heart or blood vessels and then travel to an artery in the brain. These blood clots are just like the clots that stop the bleeding when you cut yourself. They are clumps of protein and blood cells that harden into a gel.</p><p>Medicines that help prevent stroke work by reducing the chances that blood vessels will be damaged and by reducing the chances that clots will form.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9352079\"><span class=\"h1\">Which medicines might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people who have had a stroke or TIA take 3 medicines or more. That might seem like a lot, but each of them does a different job.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots or &quot;thin&quot; the blood reduce the chance clots will form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that lower blood pressure help prevent the damage to blood vessels caused by high blood pressure. These medicines also help make sure the brain gets all the blood it needs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called statins lower cholesterol levels, especially the &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol. They also help keep the arteries from getting damaged, which makes it less likely that clots will form in the first place.</p><p/><p>People with other medical conditions, such as diabetes, need different medicines to treat those conditions as well.</p><p>Whatever medicines your doctor prescribes, it's important that you take them exactly as directed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59726 \">table 1</a>). If your medicines cause unwanted side effects or if you can't afford them, talk to your doctor or nurse. He or she might have ways to deal with these problems.</p><p>This article has only some basic information on the main medicines used to prevent strokes. For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp, available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9352086\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines to prevent blood clots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When blood clots form inside the heart or blood vessels, they can travel to arteries in the brain and block the flow of blood. Medicines to prevent clots help keep this from happening. These medicines are especially important in people who have a heart condition called atrial fibrillation, because they are at high risk of forming clots.</p><p>The most commonly used medicines to prevent blood clots are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Aspirin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Clopidogrel</a> (brand name: Plavix)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pill that contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> and another medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dipyridamole</a> (brand name: Aggrenox)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> (brand name: Coumadin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Dabigatran</a> (brand name: Pradaxa)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Apixaban</a> (brand name: Eliquis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Edoxaban</a> (brand name: Savaysa)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9352093\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines to lower blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High blood pressure damages the walls of the arteries. This damage can cause small arteries in the brain to close off. It can also cause clots to form. Medicines that lower blood pressure help keep both these things from happening.</p><p>There are lots of different medicines to lower blood pressure. Some people need more than one medicine to get their blood pressure low enough. The main medicines that doctors prescribe include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ACE inhibitors and ARBs</strong> &ndash; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (called &quot;ACE inhibitors&quot;) and angiotensin receptor blockers (called &quot;ARBs&quot;) are often grouped together, because they work in similar ways. Some examples of ACE inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">enalapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">captopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lisinopril</a>. Some examples of ARBs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">candesartan</a> (brand name: Atacand) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">valsartan</a> (brand name: Diovan).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong> &ndash; Some examples of calcium channel blockers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">amlodipine</a> (brand name: Norvasc), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">felodipine</a> (brand name: Plendil) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diltiazem</a> (brand name: Cardizem).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diuretics (sometimes called &quot;water pills&quot;)</strong> &ndash; Some examples of diuretics include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> (also known as HCTZ).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9352100\"><span class=\"h1\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have<strong> </strong>had an ischemic stroke often have fatty deposits inside their arteries called plaques. These plaques are made up mostly of cholesterol. Statins lower cholesterol, so they reduce the chances that plaques will form. They might also help shrink plaques and make them less likely to break open.</p><p>Examples of statins include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">atorvastatin</a> (brand name: Lipitor), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lovastatin</a> (brand names: Mevacor, Altoprev), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pravastatin</a> (brand name: Pravachol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rosuvastatin</a> (Crestor), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">simvastatin</a> (Zocor).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9352197\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-warfarin-coumadin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Warfarin (Coumadin) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-high-blood-pressure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for high blood pressure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-direct-oral-anticoagulants-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Direct oral anticoagulants (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ischemic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
