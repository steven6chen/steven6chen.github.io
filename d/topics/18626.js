Normally, urine that the kidneys make flows to the bladder through tubes called &quot;ureters.&quot; It then flows from the bladder out of the body. In children with vesicoureteral reflux, some of the urine flows backward from the bladder through the ureters to the kidneys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75455\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75455 \">figure 1</a>). This can happen in one or both of the ureters.</p><p>This problem is most common in babies and young children. It often gets better or goes away as the child gets older. But it can also happen in older children and in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150392\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vesicoureteral reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78045288\"><span class=\"h1\">Why would a doctor think my child has vesicoureteral reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors sometimes think a child might have vesicoureteral reflux if the child has one of the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydronephrosis &ndash; This condition causes part of the kidney to swell because it has too much urine inside. It can be seen on a routine imaging test (ultrasound) to check on the baby during pregnancy. If an ultrasound done on a baby after delivery shows hydronephrosis, the baby might have vesicoureteral reflux.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infection (or &quot;UTI&quot;) &ndash; These infections are usually caused by bacteria in the bladder or kidneys. If a child has had several UTIs, the doctor might want test him or her for vesicoureteral reflux. If both conditions occur together, infected urine could flow backwards to the kidney and cause damage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150407\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for vesicoureteral reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there is a test called a &quot;voiding cystourethrogram&quot; or &quot;VCUG.&quot; For this test, the doctor puts a small, flexible tube inside the child's bladder. Next the doctor fills the child's bladder with a special fluid that shows up on X-rays. Then the child urinates while on the X-ray table. X-rays taken during this test show if the urine is flowing the wrong way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150422\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vesicoureteral reflux treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; These medicines help prevent urinary tract infections. Children being treated with antibiotics take them every day but at a lower dose than they would if they had an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Different kinds of surgery can stop the backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150437\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-hydronephrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal hydronephrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
