Potential consequences of OSA include excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired daytime function, exacerbation of metabolic abnormalities (eg, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia), and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and mortality. Several of these conditions appear to have a bidirectional risk association with OSA, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and left ventricular heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications and adverse outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>Once a patient has been diagnosed with OSA, it should be determined whether treatment is indicated and, if so, which type of therapy is most appropriate. For the majority of patients, positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The initiation of PAP therapy requires selection of a mode of PAP, device setting(s), and a patient-device interface.</p><p>The initiation of PAP therapy in patients with OSA is reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of OSA more generally are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MODES OF POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major positive airway pressure (PAP) modalities used to treat patients with OSA: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. CPAP is generally preferred for most patients because it has been well studied, is simpler to use, and is less costly. Each of these modalities requires choosing between fixed or auto-titrating technology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284804132\"><span class=\"h2\">Selecting the mode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fixed CPAP is suggested as first-line treatment for most patients with OSA because its efficacy is well established and supported by extensive clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With the advent of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT), auto-titrating CPAP is becoming more commonplace, and studies suggest that it has comparable efficacy and adherence compared with fixed CPAP, although auto-titrating flow generators can be more expensive. (See <a href=\"#H1560103363\" class=\"local\">'Choosing between fixed and auto-titrating CPAP'</a> below.)</p><p>BPAP may be used in certain subgroups of patients with OSA but is rarely indicated as first-line therapy. Subsets of patients who may benefit from a trial of BPAP include patients with coexisting OSA and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (such as those with obesity hypoventilation syndrome whose alveolar hypoventilation fails to improve despite CPAP therapy), chronic opioid use, and neuromuscular disease affecting respiration. Additionally, some patients with OSA plus central sleep apnea (CSA; including those with OSA and treatment-emergent CSA) may respond to BPAP in the spontaneous-timed (S-T) mode. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea#H18678874\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>A trial of auto-titrating BPAP may also be worthwhile for OSA patients who do not tolerate fixed or auto-titrating CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Selecting a mode of titration is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mode selection for positive airway pressure titration in adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Fixed CPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fixed CPAP delivers PAP at a level that remains relatively constant (within 1 to 2 cm of H<sub>2</sub>O) throughout the respiratory cycle. The PAP splints the upper airway open, preventing upper airway collapse or narrowing during sleep. No additional pressure above the level of CPAP is provided and patients must initiate every breath. The benefits of fixed CPAP therapy in patients with OSA are well established and are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H2269684852\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal amount of PAP delivered by a fixed CPAP device is typically determined by titration. The titration may be manually done in the sleep laboratory, as part of a full night or split-night study, or at home using an auto-titrating CPAP device. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Determining the amount of positive airway pressure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Auto-titrating CPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auto-titrating CPAP delivers an amount of PAP that varies during the night. The variation is dependent on event detection software algorithms, which will increase the pressure gradually in response to flow changes until adequate patency is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. After a period of sustained upper airway patency, the delivered level of pressure gradually decreases until the algorithm identifies recurrent upper airway obstruction, at which point the delivered pressure again increases. The result is that the delivered pressure varies throughout the night, in an effort to provide the lowest pressure that is necessary to maintain upper airway patency.</p><p>The event detection algorithms used to detect upper airway obstruction and to change the level of PAP delivered vary considerably among manufacturers and may even change with successive production versions of a given device. Thus, it is likely that performance of the auto-titrating CPAP devices is also highly variable.</p><p>Auto-titrating CPAP may not function properly if a significant leak exists, since leaks can change airflow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The algorithm employed in a particular device may also not function properly if the patient exhibits central apneas (patent upper airway with absence of inspiratory effort), as has been shown when devices are bench-tested using standardized breathing patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Newer auto-titrating flow generators (both CPAP and BPAP) will record the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) achieved during use and some even separately report obstructive or central apnea indices. This information is available by downloading the data stored on a removable memory card and can aid the clinician in determining whether the device is functioning as intended. However, these data are estimates only and cannot be equated to those obtained by direct respiratory polygraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Auto-titrating CPAP has been proposed for use in three different situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F102356\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102356 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who complain of the inability to tolerate the degree of fixed CPAP necessary to prevent respiratory events in all sleep positions and stages. These patients may benefit from auto-titrating CPAP as a pressure-relief strategy, since the device may reach higher pressures when the patient is supine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep but remain at lower, potentially more tolerable, pressures otherwise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients subjected to factors that might significantly vary their pressure requirement, such as use of alcohol, nasal congestion from allergies or upper respiratory infections leading to nasal obstruction, wide variations in body weight, higher pressure requirement in REM sleep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when sleeping in the supine position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following a diagnosis made with HSAT, when access to laboratory titration of CPAP may be delayed or is excessively inconvenient due to distance from the sleep laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H284804061\" class=\"local\">'Auto-titrating CPAP'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560103363\"><span class=\"h3\">Choosing between fixed and auto-titrating CPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have shown that there is little difference in use of fixed or auto-titrating CPAP with regard to efficacy or adherence in patients with uncomplicated moderate to severe OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. There are numerous studies showing equivalence following HSAT and, in some, adherence was actually slightly improved compared with fixed-pressure CPAP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four meta-analyses (the largest incorporating 30 studies totaling 1136 participants) found that auto-titrating CPAP and fixed CPAP equally improved the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Adherence and daytime sleepiness were, in general, slightly better with auto-titrating CPAP, but these differences were small and of questionable clinical significance. Some studies found that patient preference favored auto-titrating CPAP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the largest individual trials was a crossover study that randomly assigned 200 patients with treatment-naive OSA to receive either auto-titrating CPAP or fixed CPAP for six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. OSA was defined as subjective daytime sleepiness plus an AHI &gt;15 events per hour of sleep (mean AHI was 33 events per hour of sleep). The trial found no difference in patient preference for a device, despite the auto-titrating CPAP group having a marginally longer duration of use (4.2 versus 4.0 hours per night) and less subjective daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score of 9.5 versus 10.0). It is uncertain whether such small changes are clinically important. There was also no difference in the quality of life, objective measures of sleepiness, or psychomotor vigilance testing.</p><p/><p>It is important to note that certain patient populations have been excluded from most auto-titrating CPAP studies, and thus great care must be taken in considering auto-titrating CPAP in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with comorbid congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), central sleep apnea syndromes, and hypoventilation syndromes associated with obesity, chronic opioid use, and neuromuscular disease affecting respiration should be prescribed auto-titrating CPAP only after careful consideration, if at all.</p><p>Auto-titrating CPAP can be initiated directly after OSA is diagnosed without having to wait for an in-laboratory titration, which may be a significant advantage over fixed CPAP in some situations. The feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in selected patients was examined in a trial of 156 patients with OSA diagnosed by HSAT (AHI &ge;10 events per hour) who were randomly assigned to auto-titrating CPAP therapy or in-laboratory titration followed by fixed CPAP treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Key exclusion criteria included a history of medical nonadherence, moderate to severe COPD, use of supplemental oxygen or a low baseline nocturnal oxygen saturation (&le;88 percent for &ge;15 minutes), severe congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, neuromuscular weakness, and a central apnea index &gt;5 per hour. Results were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After six weeks of treatment, both groups showed improved daytime sleepiness and quality of life, and there were no significant between-group differences in adherence or outcomes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The residual AHI was similar between the two groups, and PAP satisfaction was higher with auto-titrating CPAP</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The time from diagnosis to treatment was significantly shorter in the auto-titrating group (50 versus 78 days)</p><p/><p>These results suggest that selected patients with a high likelihood of uncomplicated, moderate to severe OSA can be effectively treated with auto-titrating CPAP after a diagnosis of OSA is made by HSAT. Patients who do not improve clinically after initiation of auto-titrating CPAP without a titration study should undergo careful re-evaluation with consideration of an attended PAP titration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BPAP delivers PAP at different levels during inspiration and expiration. The level during inspiration is called the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and the level during expiration is called the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). Of note, BPAP should not be considered synonymous with the brand name, BiPAP. The latter is the proprietary name of a portable respiratory assist device manufactured by Respironics Corporation and is just one of many commercially available devices that can deliver BPAP.</p><p>BPAP splints the upper airway open in a manner similar to CPAP, with the exception that the EPAP component is thought to be effective in suppressing frank obstructive apneas, while IPAP primarily acts to prevent obstructive hypopneas, respiratory effort related arousals, and snoring. This is an extremely important concept when BPAP is titrated by technical personnel in the sleep laboratory.</p><p>BPAP has the additional virtue of providing a degree of ventilatory support through the application of pressure support (PS); the difference between the IPAP and EPAP is equivalent to PS, as used by practitioners specifying ventilator parameters in the intensive care unit (ICU). As an example, the tidal volume is greater when the IPAP is set at 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and the EPAP at 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (difference, or PS, of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) than when the IPAP is set at 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and the EPAP at 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (difference of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, patients are normally supplied with a spontaneous mode BPAP (BPAP-S) flow generator, which only provides breaths in response to patient inspiratory efforts. If a backup rate is required, the flow generator ordered must be specified as an S-T device, which is capable of also providing breaths on a timed basis. When no backup rate is set, the device is said to be in &quot;spontaneous&quot; (S) mode; when both patient-initiated and backup breaths are possible, the device is in &quot;spontaneous-timed&quot; (S-T) mode; and when only backup breaths are permitted, the device is in &quot;timed&quot; (T) mode. BPAP in S-T mode is generally not prescribed for OSA patients unless they exhibit treatment-induced central sleep apnea during titration with CPAP (or BPAP-S) or a mixture of obstructive and central events is noted during the diagnostic study and persist during the titration; T mode is reserved for patients with hypoventilation or central sleep apnea due to neurologic or neuromuscular disease complicated by ventilatory failure. Further details are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea#H18678888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'BPAP with a backup respiratory rate'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-treatment#H615715950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)'</a>.)</p><p>BPAP has not been as well studied as CPAP in patients with OSA alone, but probably is capable of similar results. Studies of the efficacy of BPAP in patients with OSA have been predominantly performed in patients with coexisting OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive positive airway pressure therapy of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>BPAP has also been explored as a &quot;pressure-relief&quot; technology in patients who complain of intolerance to the degree of fixed CPAP necessary to prevent respiratory events, since the average airway pressure required may be lower than when CPAP is used. As is the case with other pressure-relief technologies, however, this strategy has not been shown to improve adherence or other outcome variables in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,19</a>].</p><p>In our experience, as with auto-titrating CPAP, a small number of patients may exhibit better adherence when this mode is employed, but prescribing for this purpose should be reserved for those individuals who fail to comply with fixed or auto-titrating CPAP with pressure-relief engaged. BPAP devices are also available that auto-titrate their settings, which may represent yet another &quot;pressure-relief&quot; technology; there are few data at present to judge the utility of this modality. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Determining the amount of positive airway pressure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Pressure relief'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal amount of positive airway pressure (PAP) is determined by titration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F102356\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102356 \">algorithm 1</a>). The goal of titration is to identify a level of PAP that is acceptable to the patient, to prevent recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep, and to maintain both sleep continuity and an acceptable oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284804037\"><span class=\"h2\">Selecting the pressure settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) require engaging expiratory pressure relief and selecting the level of pressure relief; the use of BPAP devices may entail making additional choices of mode (spontaneous or timed), inspiratory rise time and related timings, and backup rate.</p><p>When deploying an auto-titrating device, pressure range(s) must be chosen. If an auto-titrating BPAP flow generator of the adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) type is required for a patient with complex combinations of OSA and central sleep apnea (CSA), additional decision-making will be necessary in terms of whether to target peak inspiratory flow or minute ventilation (varies by device manufacturer) and fixed backup rate versus automatic setting of backup rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284804055\"><span class=\"h3\">Fixed CPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal settings for fixed CPAP are traditionally obtained during an attended laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) with the patient wearing their device. </p><p>Starting at a low level (4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is recommended), the amount of CPAP is serially increased (usually in increments of 1 to 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) until evidence of upper airway obstruction is eliminated, allowing at least five minutes at each pressure. The minimal amount of CPAP that consistently prevents upper airway obstruction becomes the fixed CPAP setting. Evidence of upper airway obstruction includes snoring, apneas, hypopneas, respiratory effort related arousals, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturation.</p><p>The optimal titration pressure should reduce the frequency of respiratory events to &lt;5 per hour for at least a 15-minute period that ideally includes supine rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with few or no spontaneous arousals or awakenings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In patients who plan to use fixed CPAP for ongoing therapy, auto-titrating CPAP software can be used to determine the optimal fixed pressure settings. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'In-home titration'</a> below.)</p><p>The recommended maximum level of PAP is 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for adults; transition to BPAP should be considered if there is still upper airway obstruction at this level.

However, in some situations an in-laboratory titration can provide the basis for specifying the pressure range when an auto-titrating device is chosen for either initial or subsequently modified therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284804067\"><span class=\"h3\">BPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The titration of BPAP differs from CPAP because two levels of PAP need to be adjusted: the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP).</p><p>In a patient not previously titrated on PAP, initial IPAP and EPAP are usually started at 8 and 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. Both IPAP and EPAP are then serially increased by 1 to 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, allowing at least five minutes at each pressure, until frank obstructive apneas are eliminated. After that, IPAP alone is titrated in the same manner until obstructive hypopneas, respiratory effort related arousals, and snoring are eliminated. In a patient previously titrated on CPAP, the starting EPAP can be set to the CPAP value that eliminated obstructive apneas during the previous study, and the IPAP is set to a level 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O higher. The minimum recommended IPAP-EPAP differential is 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and the maximum is 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>Once partial and complete upper airway obstruction are eliminated, the IPAP alone is increased if additional ventilation is required.

The factors that could contribute to this clinical judgment are not stated, although a previous AASM practice parameter mentions &ldquo;repetitive long obstructions and major desaturations&rdquo; as examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Since these are given only as examples, room is clearly left for arriving at a clinical judgment to split a study using other considerations, and qualifying AHIs as low as <span class=\"nowrap\">20/hour</span> have been commonly adopted in clinical practice. Attention must also be paid to time constraints, in that at least three hours of PSG time should be available for adequate titration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

An auto-titrating CPAP device could conceivably be employed during the titration phase, but this is not a typical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. Neither this strategy nor initial titration of BPAP during the treatment phase of a split-night study can be recommended due to the lack of published information on efficacy.</p><p>Titration during split-night studies is less costly, reduces the delay in prescribing treatment, and is more convenient for patients than titration during full-night studies. However, there are important drawbacks to this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split-night studies may not allow enough time for an optimal CPAP titration or for transitioning to BPAP if that becomes necessary</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood of observing the patient when the risk of OSA is highest (ie, during REM sleep in the supine position) is reduced</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are fewer opportunities for patient education, and a higher degree of technologist skill is required</p><p/><p>Such drawbacks may explain why one study found that a split-night protocol tended to derive a CPAP level that was lower than that derived from full-night studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">In-home titration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During an in-home titration, the patient is given auto-titrating CPAP, which contains event detection software providing estimates of the AHI, hours of use, and presence or absence of a mask leak. The minimum and maximum CPAP pressures must be specified by the prescriber; usually a minimum of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and maximum of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O will bracket the pressure requirements of most patients. The level of pressure that eliminates all evidence of upper airway obstruction for more than 90 or 95 percent of the time (depending on the device model) becomes the fixed CPAP setting.</p><p>It should be emphasized that the AHI provided by auto-titrating CPAP devices is only an estimate of the AHI that might be measured in the sleep laboratory, although studies suggest good correlation if the AHI is either fairly high or &lt;10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27</a>]. Guidelines for scoring respiratory events include the presence of oxyhemoglobin desaturation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arousal from sleep, neither of which is measured by auto-titrating devices. In addition, the degree of airflow reduction used to score a respiratory event may not adhere to published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Several randomized trials, however, suggest that in-home titration is as effective as full-night, attended, in-laboratory titration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. In one trial, 200 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with OSA via attended, in-laboratory polysomnography were randomly assigned to have their PAP level determined by either one night of in-laboratory fixed CPAP titration or three nights of in-home auto-titrating CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The latter group was then transitioned to fixed CPAP at the level at which the auto-titrating device eliminated upper airway obstruction. At three months, there were no differences in quality of life, daytime sleepiness, or hours of CPAP use. The generalizability of these results may well be limited; patients with a cardiorespiratory or a comorbid sleep disorder were excluded.</p><p>The primary advantage of in-home titration is the elimination of a separate stay in the sleep laboratory. This strategy may reduce both the costs and any delay until titration can be performed, depending upon the time necessary to access sleep laboratory services in any given location. In-home titration may also extend care to patients in areas that lack sleep laboratories.</p><p>The major disadvantage of in-home titration is the absence of a technologist or clinician with expertise in the management of sleep disorders who can choose, adjust, and adjudicate the patient-device interface. The growing variety of nasal pillows, face masks, and hybrid interfaces that are available makes this limitation increasingly pertinent. Additional disadvantages of in-home titration include the inability to determine the effect of positional changes (ideally, titration should encompass supine and non-supine sleep), the need for a pressure-relief setting, and the effect of humidification.</p><p>BPAP titration is more complex and should never be guided by unattended, in-home portable monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284801771\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT-DEVICE INTERFACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A properly fitting interface between the patient and the device optimizes efficacy (by ensuring delivery of the target airway pressure) and adherence (by optimizing patient comfort and convenience).</p><p>Patients should be encouraged to try several different interfaces at the same time that the optimal level of positive airway pressure (PAP) is determined, so that the interface that offers the best mix of comfort and efficacy is determined (ie, the most comfortable mask is not always the best-fitting and the best-fitting mask is not always the most comfortable) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, trials of different interfaces may be necessary for the patient at home even after the seemingly best-fitting interface and optimal level of PAP have been determined in the laboratory or sleep clinic. </p><p>Options include nasal masks, nasal pillows, full facemasks (ie, oronasal masks), and oral interfaces. Although in some patients oronasal masks may be associated with higher continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressures and suboptimal control, when compared with nasal masks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], in reality, the optimal interface varies from patient to patient. Many experts agree that the best interface is &quot;the one the patient will use.&quot; Common issues to consider when selecting an interface include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Claustrophobia &ndash; Claustrophobic patients may find nasal pillows less intimidating than other interfaces. Alternatively, desensitization to a nasal mask can be attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. One approach to desensitization is to have the patient wear the mask during the day, for progressively longer periods, while reading or watching television. The goal is to increase the patient's tolerance of the mask and also of positive pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal congestion &ndash; Nasal congestion is a common problem that may pre-exist or be precipitated by PAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Airflow resistance is higher when nasal congestion is present, which can impair comfortable breathing through the nose and negatively impact adherence. It may also impede the transmission of enough PAP to the upper airway, impairing the amelioration of upper airway collapse during sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical nasal glucocorticoids, nasal antihistamines or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>, or oral antihistamines may improve nasal congestion or rhinorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A facemask that covers both the nose and mouth may also be helpful, allowing the positive pressure to be delivered through the mouth if nasal patency is compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

A mouth leak exists when the airflow delivered through the nose exits through the mouth instead of reaching the more distal oropharyngeal airway. A chin strap that holds the mouth closed may be sufficient to eliminate a mouth leak. Some patients continue to have a mouth leak despite a chin strap, in which case a full facemask is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial hair &ndash; Male patients with a mustache or beard may experience excessive leakage with nasal masks or full facemasks, respectively, in which case nasal pillows can be employed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cosmetic issues &ndash; Some patients may complain that the interface headgear disturbs their hair style.

Some interfaces are less likely to interfere with vision in these situations (eg, nasal pillows).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headgear placement &ndash; Some interfaces employ headgear that is difficult for patients to put in place or adjust. In our experience, nasal pillows are often the easiest to take on and off. With any interface, the patient may experience difficulty replacing the interface when sleep is interrupted for bathroom breaks or other reasons. In this case we instruct patients to simply disconnect the distal end of the tubing from the PAP device rather than trying to remove and replace the interface itself.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal pillows &ndash; In general, most patients will not tolerate nasal pillows if CPAP or inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) is above 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O due to the discomfort of excessive airflow against the nasal mucosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral interfaces &ndash; Oral interfaces are rarely used but may be helpful in certain situations if nasal or oronasal interfaces cannot be tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCESSORY FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expiratory pressure relief is a feature that briefly lowers the delivered positive airway pressure (PAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pressure is lowered during early expiration with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), whereas it is lowered at end-inspiration and early expiration with bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). The purpose of pressure relief is to improve adherence by reducing the uncomfortable sensation of breathing against high pressure.</p><p>A beneficial impact of pressure relief on adherence has not been proven in randomized trials when compared with either conventional CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] or auto-titrating CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] without pressure relief. This was best demonstrated by a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (514 patients, mean apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;30 events per hour of sleep) that compared CPAP with pressure relief to conventional CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The meta-analysis found no differences in adherence, sleepiness, or vigilance.</p><p>Despite the lack of evidence that routine administration of pressure relief improves adherence, a trial of pressure relief may be worthwhile for those patients who do not tolerate CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is especially true if the patient specifically complains of discomfort caused by exhaling against PAP. However, there are no specific indications for initiating expiratory pressure relief other than intolerance to breathing out against pressure. In practice, incorporating expiratory pressure relief into a prescription for CPAP or BPAP is variable. It has long been known that compliance to positive airway pressure treatment is established in the first few weeks of use and therefore any strategy that could accomplish early adaptation is worth using from the very beginning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Humidification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor mouth leaks allow unidirectional nasal airflow, which tends to dry the nasal mucosa and increase nasal resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Heated humidification decreases the nasal resistance approximately 50 percent, whereas cold humidification has almost no impact because it does little to raise relative humidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>In theory, reduced nasal resistance may improve the comfort and effectiveness of PAP delivered via nasal mask or nasal pillows. However, clinical studies have not found such benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. We believe heated humidification is mandatory in dry climates (including during the winter indoor heating season in cold weather areas) and in patients with allergic rhinitis; the American Academy of Sleep Medicine advocates heated humidification for all patients who receive CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients who have undergone uvulopalatopharyngoplasty may have increased sensitivity to dry air and also likely benefit from heated humidification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p>Tube condensation, also known as &quot;rain-out,&quot; can occur because of temperature differences between the environment and the tubing. Rain-out results in excess water droplets in the tubing and may reduce adherence to PAP therapy. External insulation of PAP tubing with cloth or the use of climate control tubing may reduce rain-out, but there is limited published data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure ramp</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pressure ramp initiates PAP delivery at a low level (usually 4 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and then progressively increases the PAP to the prescribed level over a duration designated by the clinician (usually 5 to 45 minutes). This feature serves as a comfort measure, allowing the patient to fall asleep before reaching the higher pressures that might interfere with sleep onset. The pressure ramp can be restarted at any time and is available with CPAP and BPAP, whether fixed or auto-titrating.</p><p>There are no published data indicating that a ramp feature augments acceptance or adherence with CPAP, although many clinicians routinely prescribe a pressure ramp. Ramp abuse refers to repeated activation of the ramp feature, which can diminish the effectiveness of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It can be addressed by increasing the starting pressure to a level just below the therapeutic pressure or disabling the ramp function. Alternatively, repeat titration may be worthwhile if there is suspicion that the ramp abuse is indicative of a therapeutic pressure target that is too high. Changing from a nasal mask to a facemask may be worthwhile if there is suspicion that the ramp abuse is indicative of discomfort associated with the stronger force of flow from a nasal mask.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Altitude compensation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies performed using a decompression chamber demonstrated that the level of PAP generated by some devices at one altitude may decrease significantly at higher altitudes and result in lack of effective treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
