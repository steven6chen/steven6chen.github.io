The human gut microbiota is estimated to consist of as many as 1000 to 1200 bacterial species and at least 10<sup>14</sup> bacteria, most of which are in the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The beneficial roles mediated by the microbiota for the host include the synthesis of vitamins, the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates, the metabolism of bile and host hormones, and competitive exclusion (&quot;colonization resistance&quot;) of pathogens taking residence in the gut community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Antibiotic-mediated changes in the composition of the gut microbiota may also lead to homeostatic imbalance through alterations in the gut barrier functions and result in mucosal immune defects, which would predispose the host to enteric infections such as <em>C. difficile</em> by allowing environmentally acquired spores to germinate and successfully colonize the gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Although specific antimicrobial therapy is effective against <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI), recurrence of CDI is an increasing problem following therapy.

A number of studies have demonstrated that a single administration has been extremely efficacious in eradicating CDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/16,19,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,21,23</a>]. Given the ease of administration in both inpatient and outpatient settings and the delivery of the introduced flora to the site where most <em>C. difficile</em> is located, administration via a colonoscope has been proposed as the preferential route of delivery of fecal microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

In a randomized trial, 46 patients with three or more recurrences of CDI who had received a full course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> for their most recent acute episode were assigned to donor stool or their own stool (autologous FMT) as placebo administered by colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients who received donor FMT achieved significantly higher clinical cure rates as compared with the autologous FMT group (92 versus 63 percent). High response to autologous FMT may be due to recent antibiotic exposure prior to FMT, inclusion of patients with colonization with <em>C. difficile</em>, or post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11299943\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasogastric/jejunal tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration via a <span class=\"nowrap\">nasogastric/jejunal</span> tube permits delivery of the bacteria to the small bowel and then throughout the colon.

Two patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease experienced a disease flare after colonoscopically administered FMT. However, it is unclear if this was attributable to FMT.

The SAE do not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.</p><p>Given the potential for transmission of infectious agents contained in the stool, we attempt to reduce risk by obtaining stool from healthy donors with normal bowel function and by testing both stool and blood for common viral and bacterial pathogens and parasites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. However, it has been suggested that FMT using full-spectrum microbiota possesses a protective mechanism that prevents infection transmission. The most likely explanation is the protective effect of complete stool's &quot;colonization resistance&quot; known to inhibit growth of most pathogens in the absence of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. This safety feature is absent in synthetic stool and probiotics, with published reports of dangerous contaminations in such products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUGGESTED PROTOCOL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) depends upon a number of factors, including the frequency of enema administration, the use of colonic lavage, and repopulation of the entire colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Treatment with FMT has been hampered by a lack of standardization in the preparation, and logistic difficulties in preparation and administration of the fecal suspension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The use of frozen-and-thawed (frozen) FMT has the potential advantage of immediate availability. In a randomized non-inferiority trial, 219 patients with recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI) or refractory CDI were assigned to receive frozen or fresh FMT via rectal enema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In the modified intention-to-treat population, rates of clinical resolution in the frozen and fresh FMT groups were 75 versus 70 percent, respectively (difference 4.7 percent, 95% CI, 5.2% to &infin;). Frozen FMT was non-inferior to fresh FMT, and there were no observed differences in adverse events between the treatment groups. </p><p>The following protocol for administration via the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract (based upon our clinical experience) has been effective in achieving prolonged cure in over 90 percent of our patients after a single infusion and &gt;98 percent after two infusions, with long-term resolution of symptoms (no diarrhea, abdominal pain or cramping, and negative stool toxin tests, polymerase chain reaction, and <em>C. difficile</em> culture). In addition, several of our patients have subsequently received antibiotics and have not relapsed. An alternate approach is to administer the suspension via the upper GI tract (see <a href=\"#H123835\" class=\"local\">'Administration via the upper GI tract'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123827\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration via the lower GI tract</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor stool and blood are screened for pathogens and viruses before infusion. We perform a complete blood count and serological testing for hepatitis A, B, and C; HIV-1 and HIV-2; and syphilis. Stool tests including fecal <em>Giardia </em>antigen, <em>Cryptosporidium</em> antigen, acid-fast stain for <em>Cyclospora</em>, <em>Isospora</em>, <em>Dientamoeba fragilis</em>, <em>Blastocystis hominis</em>, norovirus and rotavirus, and <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> fecal antigen for upper GI tract administration. Stool cultures are obtained to look for enteric bacterial pathogens and light microscopy examination of stool samples is carried out for ova and parasites. Donor stool should also be screened for <em>C. difficile </em>to rule out asymptomatic carriage, even if stool is formed. Clinically, the donor needs to have normal, daily stools, no recent antibiotics (ie, not in the last six months), no history of inflammatory bowel disease, and be clinically well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90323\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90323 \">table 1</a>). A relative or friend may be a donor. However, we do not believe donors should share living quarters with the patient, as there is likelihood that they will share the same defective microbiota. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recipient's HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C, syphilis, and stool parasite status is also checked prior to receipt of FMT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (500 mg twice daily for seven days) followed by a single oral lavage with 3 to 4 liters of polyethylene glycol with electrolytes purgative (such as GoLYTELY). We forego the lavage in patients too ill to tolerate it, but use the vancomycin pretreatment whenever possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults#H148494535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults&quot;, section on 'Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use 200 to 300 g of donor stool suspended in 200 to 300 mL of sterile normal saline (homogenized briefly in a kitchen blender to a liquid consistency) administered initially via colonoscope and next day via enema within 10 minutes of preparation in patients with <em>C. difficile</em> and repeated daily for five days in those with <em>C. difficile </em>complicating colitis or Crohn disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We encourage patients to retain the enema for at least six hours. Some patients are unable to retain the enema initially for prolonged periods. Nevertheless, coating of the mucosa by the infusate appears to be adequate. Pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> (2 mg, followed by an additional 2 mg every two hours, up to a total of 8 mg), may help with retention of the enema. During the treatment period, patients are advised to adhere to a high fiber diet to assist in the support of infused bacteria. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial infusion should be filtered and infused preferably via colonoscopy, into the terminal ileum, to address known ileal presence of <em>C. difficile</em>. One study demonstrated that in the less severely affected patients, a single colonoscopic infusion of 200 to 300 g of stool suspension throughout the colon will suffice to cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, in patients with colonic inflammation, the risk of colon perforation is increased, so if this method is used, it should be done with extreme care. Following endoscopic infusion, we suggest that at least five days of rectal enemas be administered daily using donor stool. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123835\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration via the upper GI tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternate route of administration is via a nasogastric (NG) or nasojejunal tube (NJ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient and stool preparation is similar to the procedure used for patients receiving their suspension via the lower GI tract.
