Most of the time, metastatic breast cancer cannot be cured. However, treatment can help you live longer, slow your cancer's progression, relieve your symptoms, and improve your quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282190569\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the goal of prolonging survival, treatment can help relieve cancer-associated symptoms, which can improve your overall quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554276112\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO PATIENTS WITH A LOCAL RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women treated for breast cancer are at risk of a &quot;local&quot; recurrence. For women who had breast-conserving treatment (BCT), this may present as a new tumor in the breast. For women who had a mastectomy (removal of one or both breasts), it may present as a mass on the skin or chest wall. Women who had either type of surgery may also experience recurrence in the axilla (armpit area). </p><p>The approach to treatment will depend on the size and location of your tumor, as well as whether or not you have had radiation therapy (RT). Your doctors and surgeons can talk with you to determine the most appropriate treatment plan. If surgery is not an option, radiation may be an alternative treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104510926\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All people with metastatic breast cancer usually receive systemic (drug) therapy. However, in certain circumstances, treatment may also involve surgery or radiation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630539986\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment to a specific lesion (mass) may be required if it is causing symptoms or there is a threat of complications (ie, spinal cord compression or fracture, brain metastases at risk for herniation, or fracture risk due to a lesion in the hip). This may require either a surgical approach or radiation therapy (RT) to stabilize the affected area. The approach must be tailored to the person's specific situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104510782\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic therapy includes the use of endocrine therapy (ET), chemotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drugs called &quot;biologic agents.&quot; The choice between them depends on the tumor characteristics, the person's symptoms, and several other factors including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Status of hormone receptors &ndash; Some breast cancers have &quot;receptors&quot; to certain hormones (estrogen or progesterone), meaning those hormones can affect their growth. These are referred to as estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PR) receptor-positive cancers. People whose cancer falls into this category tend to do better than those whose tumors are ER- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PR-negative. Additionally, people with hormone receptor-positive cancer are candidates for ET, but those with hormone receptor-negative cancer are not. (See <a href=\"#H282191720\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HER2 expression &ndash; Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a protein that is present in some aggressive breast cancers. People with HER2-positive cancer may benefit from certain treatments that target this protein. (See <a href=\"#H282191900\" class=\"local\">'HER2-targeted agents'</a> below.).</p><p/><p>Hormone receptor and HER2 status should be reassessed if a person experiences recurrent disease (relapse). This is because metastatic cancer can have different characteristics from the primary (original) breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630540013\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment options</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191720\"><span class=\"h4\">Endocrine therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocrine therapy (ET) is also known as &quot;antiestrogen treatment.&quot; This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) &ndash; Tamoxifen or toremifene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) &ndash; Anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs) &ndash; Fulvestrant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progestogens &ndash; Megestrol acetate or medroxyprogesterone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other sex steroid hormones &ndash; Progestins, estrogens, androgens</p><p/><p>Women who have not yet been through menopause (when monthly periods stop) can also receive ET, but some types of ET must be combined with another treatment to stop the ovaries from making estrogen. This might involve surgery to remove the ovaries (&quot;oophorectomy&quot;) or medications called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and antagonists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191942\"><span class=\"h5\">Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These agents block estrogen from stimulating breast cells. The one used in the treatment of breast cancer is tamoxifen.</p><p>Tamoxifen is a pill that you take by mouth. It is commonly used as a first-line ET for premenopausal women and for men with advanced breast cancer. </p><p>Most people with ER <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PR-positive breast cancer will respond to tamoxifen therapy. However, some do not respond at all to tamoxifen. Others originally respond to tamoxifen but later become resistant. Unfortunately, most if not all breast cancers eventually stop responding to tamoxifen.</p><p>A subset of people with metastatic breast cancer experience a &quot;flare&quot; of their breast cancer within two days to three weeks after starting tamoxifen. This may cause an increase in bone pain, a high blood calcium level, and in people with breast cancer involving the skin, an increase in the size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> number of these skin nodules, or skin redness. Tumor flares usually subside within four to six weeks. In the meantime, the symptoms can be treated with measures that reduce pain and lower blood levels of calcium. In severe cases, your doctor may tell you to temporarily stop taking tamoxifen until the flare subsides. Many doctors consider a flare reaction to be a sign that ET is working. Side effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes, an increased risk of blood clots, uterine bleeding, and endometrial cancer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191972\"><span class=\"h5\">Aromatase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are drugs that reduce estrogen levels in the body by blocking the protein that helps make estrogen outside of the ovary (aromatase). Drugs in this class include anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. Side effects of AIs include hot flashes, bone loss and bone fractures, and pain in the muscles and joints.</p><p>Some data show that an AI with other kinds of drugs may be better than the AI alone. Examples include the combination of letrozole and a drug called a CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor (eg, palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib), and the combination of exemestane and everolimus. While effective, however, these regimens are associated with more side effects than seen with just the AI by itself. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282192001\"><span class=\"h5\">Pure antiestrogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure antiestrogens block the influence of estrogen on breast cancer cells. The agent from this class used in metastatic breast cancer is fulvestrant. It is given as a monthly intramuscular (IM) injection and can be used in postmenopausal women as a first line of therapy. Fulvestrant can also be used in postmenopausal women whose cancers have progressed despite prior ET. It may be given with a second drug, palbociclib or abemaciclib, in this setting.</p><p>Side effects of fulvestrant include hot flashes, increases in your liver enzymes, injection site pain, and joint pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282192160\"><span class=\"h5\">Sex steroid hormones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progestins, estrogens, and androgens may play a role in the third- or fourth-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progestins &ndash; These include both medroxyprogesterone or megestrol acetate and are taken as a pill. It is sometimes used in women who have stopped responding to tamoxifen. The side effects of treatment include blood clot formation, weight gain, fluid retention, and vaginal bleeding. In some studies, a reduction in the quality of life has been seen in women taken these drugs. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estrogen &ndash; For women who have progressed on multiple treatments with antiestrogens, estradiol may be used. It is given as a pill and is taken daily. Side effects include vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, nausea and vomiting, and venous thrombosis. Women on estrogen may also experience a tumor flare. For women who experience bleeding on estrogens, progestin treatment can provide control of symptoms. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androgens &ndash; Male hormones, called androgens, are rarely used in metastatic breast cancer. Despite evidence that they can help tumors shrink, they are not as effective as more modern therapies, such as tamoxifen, the AIs, or fulvestrant, and the side effects of treatment (virilization, edema, and jaundice) make them a less attractive option for both women and their clinicians. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191734\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy is a treatment given to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Chemotherapy is not given every day but instead is given in cycles. A cycle is the time it takes to give the treatment and then allow the body to recover from the side effects of the medicines. A typical cycle of chemotherapy is 21 or 28 days.</p><p>Chemotherapy drugs may be given alone, one after another, or in combination. There are a variety of drugs that can be used to treat breast cancer as both single agents or in combination. You should discuss which treatment is right for you with your doctor. </p><p>It is not clear how many doses of chemotherapy are best for treating metastatic breast cancer. Several studies have compared the benefit of continuous chemotherapy (giving chemotherapy until it becomes ineffective) versus intermittent chemotherapy (giving approximately six cycles of chemotherapy followed by no chemotherapy until the cancer progresses). In general, overall survival is the same in women treated with continuous or intermittent chemotherapy, although tumor growth may be slowed somewhat in women treated with continuous therapy. Intermittent chemotherapy may allow for a better quality of life. This is a reasonable option if your cancer-related symptoms stay under control during treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191743\"><span class=\"h3\">Biologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic therapy aims to target a specific protein or pathway in an effort to stop cancer cells from growing or dividing. For people with metastatic breast cancer, these agents include HER2-targeted agents and bone-modifying agents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191900\"><span class=\"h4\">HER2-targeted agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People whose breast cancers produce high levels of HER2 can benefit from treatments that target this protein. There are several drugs in this category, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and lapatinib. &#160;</p><p>Anti-HER2 therapies can be used alone, or with chemotherapy or ET, or even with each other in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Your oncologist will decide which of these strategies is preferable based on your circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191850\"><span class=\"h5\">Trastuzumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trastuzumab is generally given IV once per week or once every three weeks. The most common side effect of trastuzumab is fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chills. Heart failure develops in about 3 to 5 percent of women treated with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab-related heart damage may not be permanent, and improvements have been seen once trastuzumab is discontinued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94370266\"><span class=\"h5\">Pertuzumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pertuzumab is a similar drug to trastuzumab. It has not been tested by itself, or by itself with other types of therapies like endocrine or chemotherapies. However, when combined with chemotherapy and trastuzumab, pertuzumab is more effective than just chemotherapy and trastuzumab, and so it is often added to chemotherapy and trastuzumab.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94370273\"><span class=\"h5\">Ado-trastuzumab emtansine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emtansine is a very potent and very toxic chemotherapy drug. However, it has been joined or &quot;conjugated&quot; to trastuzumab, so that the trastuzumab carries it directly, and only, to cells that make HER2. The conjugate is then taken inside the cell, where the link is broken and the emtansine is released to kill the cell. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine has been found to be active even when trastuzumab itself does not work. In addition, it is just as active as some trastuzumab plus chemotherapy combinations. However, some of the emtansine does leak out into the blood system, which can lead to more side effects than are seen with trastuzumab alone &ndash; most notably, low platelet counts (platelets are made in your bone marrow and stop bleeding) and damage to the nerves of the fingers and toes (&quot;peripheral neuropathy&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191857\"><span class=\"h5\">Lapatinib</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lapatinib is an oral medication that targets HER2 in a different way than trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Lapatinib may be used alone, in combination with chemotherapy, or even in combination with trastuzumab. The most common side effects of lapatinib alone are diarrhea, a skin rash that resembles acne, and nausea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104510875\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone-modifying agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone-modifying agents can help prevent the complications of breast cancer involving bones, such as fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Two classes of agents used are the bisphosphonates (pamidronate, zoledronic acid, clodronate and ibandronate) and the RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B) ligand inhibitor, denosumab.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630539956\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of surgery or radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main role of surgery or RT for treatment of metastatic breast cancer is to alleviate particularly severe, urgent, or life-threatening complications of cancer in specific sites, such as in the brain, spinal cord, or bones. These therapies are most often recommended if systemic therapy (ET, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy) is not likely to work, or not likely to work quickly enough.</p><p>Some patients will develop metastatic disease that is confined to one organ, such as involvement in one area of the liver or one lobe of the lung. In these cases, some doctors favor treatment directed at the tumor site. This may consist of surgical resection, targeted radiation, radiation frequency ablation, chemoembolization, or other methods. None of these have been shown to improve survival in metastatic breast cancer and these approaches are rarely used, although they may be appropriate in highly selected situations.</p><p>For those who are considered to be candidates for a local treatment approach, criteria are used to select patients most likely to benefit from site-specific treatment. Some criteria used to help identify people most likely to benefit include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good functional status &ndash; People who have minimal cancer-related symptoms and are independent with their activities of daily living tend to do better following surgery for metastatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited number of sites of disease &ndash; Patients with limited disease appear to benefit more from surgery compared with those with multiple sites of disease or with multi-organ involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long disease-free interval &ndash; Patients who experienced a recurrence after a long period of remission do better than those with rapidly progressive cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Likelihood of a complete tumor resection &ndash; The outcomes following surgery are best in patients who undergo a complete resection of their disease with no evidence of cancer cells remaining after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282191884\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best approach to treating metastatic breast cancer depends on your situation, your preferences, and the specific characteristics of your cancer. </p><p>Most doctors recommend initial treatment with chemotherapy for rapidly growing disease in the lungs or liver, or in women with severe symptoms related to metastatic breast cancer. Combination chemotherapy (ie, chemotherapy with multiple drugs) is associated with better responses compared with single-agent chemotherapy. However, treatment using single agents in a sequential fashion is associated with less toxicity (ie, fewer side effects) than the use of a combination regimen. The following recommendations apply to all people with metastatic breast cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer who are not terribly symptomatic, and do not have life-threatening disease or evidence of visceral involvement, do not require chemotherapy and can be treated with endocrine therapy (ET).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have not yet completed menopause may benefit from ET in combination with ovarian suppression, although some may choose to take tamoxifen alone. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequential ET is recommended to treat hormone-positive breast cancer. Most clinicians will recommend chemotherapy only for people who progress despite two or three trials of ET. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For people who have estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer and those with ER-positive breast cancer that does not respond to ET, chemotherapy is indicated. There is no one standard of care; the specific chemotherapy regimen (drugs used) depends on the woman's situation and the characteristics of her cancer. Your doctor can talk to you about the different options.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=865\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
