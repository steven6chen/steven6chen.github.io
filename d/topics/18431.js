The ectopic endometrial tissue appears to induce hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the surrounding myometrium, which results in a diffusely enlarged uterus (often termed &quot;globular&quot; enlargement) analogous to the concentric enlargement of the pregnant uterus. However, some women have only small areas of diffuse disease that are only apparent by microscopy, whereas others develop nodules (termed adenomyomas), which clinically resemble leiomyomas. The uterus only rarely exceeds the size of a pregnant uterus at 12 weeks of gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of adenomyosis has not been determined accurately since the diagnosis can only be made with certainty by microscopic examination of the uterus, typically following hysterectomy. Although generally estimated to affect 20 percent of women, the incidence was approximately 65 percent in one study in which meticulous histopathological analysis of multiple myometrial sections was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A full understanding of the epidemiology of the disease is limited by the difficulty in making the diagnosis. Until recently, adenomyosis was only diagnosed at the time of hysterectomy. Most studies suggest that women undergoing hysterectomy for adenomyosis are in the later part of their reproductive years. However, this results in a lack of information about early stages of disease. Studies that use pelvic imaging, rather than hysterectomy, for diagnosis suggest that adenomyosis can be found in adolescents.</p><p>In addition, the fact that adenomyosis coexists with other uterine diseases, primarily uterine leiomyomas and endometriosis, contributes to the gaps in the understanding of this disease. As an example, persistence of pelvic pain following optimal endometriosis surgical therapy may be confounded by the presence of adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, one study argued that adenomyosis was a variant and not a true disease because the presenting symptoms for hysterectomy were similar with and without the finding of adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, at the time of recruitment, all women were at least 42 years old and women were followed for 10 years, so the cohort represented only perimenopausal women.</p><p>Other studies suggest, however, that women with adenomyosis do differ from women with other disease processes. A longitudinal study recruiting women starting at age 22, found that compared to women with endometriosis, women with adenomyosis had increasing parity, early menarche and shorter menstrual cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Half of the women in both groups had concomitant leiomyomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A second study utilized a case control model comparing women undergoing hysterectomy where leiomyomas were found on pathologic exam and matched them to women where only adenomyosis was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this study, women with adenomyosis were significantly younger and were more likely to have dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and depression and a history of prior uterine surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a multivariate analysis confined to women with uteri weighing more than 150 grams, women with adenomyosis were more likely to have depression and endometriosis compared to women with only fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Adenomyosis appears to be more common in parous than nulliparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. However, a greater number of pregnancies are not associated with a higher risk of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The relationship between parity and adenomyosis may be biased since the diagnosis is typically made only at hysterectomy. Interestingly, the situation is just the opposite in women with leiomyomas, in whom parity is associated with a decreased risk of disease.</p><p>Several studies have reported that prior uterine surgery may also be a risk factor for adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of adenomyosis is not known. The two major theories are that it either develops from endomyometrial invagination of the endometrium or de novo from mullerian rests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A mouse model of adenomyosis supports the invagination hypothesis, facilitated by weakness of degenerating uterine smooth muscle tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, a metaplastic process appears to be more likely given a report of adenomyosis in a woman with Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome who lacked eutopic endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There is also increasing molecular evidence that the adenomyotic glands differ in expression of key molecules from eutopic endometrial glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>].</p><p>There is also evidence that the junctional zone of the myometrium may play a key role in this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is a structurally distinct region (appearing as a dark band on T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging) that separates the subendometrial myometrium from the outer myometrium. Increasing studies show this region has ultrastructural changes and differential growth factor expression that may influence physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Gonadal steroid hormones (estrogen and progesterone) appear to play a role in adenomyosis pathophysiology, as they do in other gynecologic disorders. This conclusion is primarily inferred from the response of symptoms to steroidal treatments. There are, however, studies that suggest that estrogen is produced in adenomyotic tissue and in vitro studies that suggest that aromatase in the endometrium of women with adenomyosis is normalized by gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, but no studies of direct action on adenomyotic implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. A murine model of adenomyosis suggests that early exposure to estrogen (in this experiment, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>) leads to an increased risk of adenomyosis and abnormal myometrium, which also supports the invagination hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Finally, other animal models suggest that pituitary protein hormones, including prolactin and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which have direct uterine effects, may also have roles in the pathogenesis of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/10,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24-26</a>]. Both direct exposure of the uterus to prolactin and hyperprolactinemia secondary to SSRI use appear capable of inducting uterine adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This hypothesis is strengthened by the recent work showing both depression and antidepressant use are increased in women with adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that adenomyosis and leiomyomas share elements of pathogenesis such as growth factor dysregulation and abnormalities of angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/15,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28-31</a>]. In model systems, the efficacy of some conventional and investigational therapies may be mediated through these systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>].</p><p>Although adenomyosis and endometriosis both represent disorders of ectopic endometrium and can be a cause of pelvic pain, the two diseases are not thought to be otherwise related. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Just as endometriosis can be localized or diffuse, adenomyosis can be present diffusely throughout the myometrium, or confined to a discrete area termed an adenomyoma. On gross inspection, the uterus with diffuse adenomyosis is uniformly enlarged and boggy, in contrast to the irregular and firm appearance of the fibroid uterus. The average uterine weight is usually between 80 and 200 grams, unless coexisting leiomyomas are present. Upon sectioning the uterus, the myometrial wall appears thickened and often contains small hemorrhagic or chocolate colored areas representing islands of endometrial bleeding. Adenomyomas can clinically resemble leiomyomas. Adenomyomas are not easily excised, unlike myomas, which can be readily shelled out from the surrounding myometrium. A plane is not easily developed and sharp dissection is required.</p><p>The term cystic is used to describe either diffuse adenomyosis or adenomyomas for which with cysts &ge;1 cm in diameter are seen on imaging studies. The entity &ldquo;juvenile cystic adenomyoma&rdquo; has been used, mainly in reports from Japan, to describe a syndrome in which women 30 years or younger with severe dysmenorrhea have myometrial cysts &ge;1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].&nbsp;However, authors from other countries have reported cystic adenomyosis in women of a variety of reproductive ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].&nbsp;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopic appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathognomonic feature of adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium at a distance of at least one low power field (some authorities insist on two low power fields) from the endomyometrial junction. The distance requirement is to preclude mistaking the normal endometrium between muscle fibers at the mucosa for adenomyosis when the specimen is transected for slide preparation. The widespread use of endometrial ablation potentially could confound the diagnosis as the procedure distorts or destroys the <span class=\"nowrap\">endometrial/myometrial</span> junction.</p><p>A zone of myometrial hypertrophy and hyperplasia surrounds the adenomatous tissue. The ectopic endometrium may show a functional response to estrogen and progesterone, but usually has an immature proliferative pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heavy menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation are the major symptoms of adenomyosis, occurring in approximately 60 and 25 percent of women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Chronic pelvic pain may occur. Symptoms typically are reported to develop between the ages of 40 and 50 years; however, this may reflect the fact that most adenomyosis has historically been diagnosed at hysterectomy. Newer reports using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria for diagnosis suggest that the disease may cause dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain in adolescents and younger reproductive-age women than previously appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Menorrhagia is possibly related to the increased endometrial surface of the enlarged uterus, while pain may be due to bleeding and swelling of endometrial islands confined by myometrium. Approximately one-third of women are asymptomatic.</p><p>As discussed above, physical examination usually reveals diffuse uterine enlargement (often termed &quot;globular&quot; enlargement), generally not exceeding the size of a pregnant uterus at 12 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, some women have a normal sized uterus while others develop nodules (termed adenomyomas), which clinically resemble leiomyomas. The uterus may be tender.</p><p>One epidemiologic study noted an increased risk of preterm birth in women with adenomyosis, which was diagnosed by either ultrasound or MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This association may have been related to confounders or misdiagnosis of the disease; confirmation is required.</p><p>It is controversial whether adenomyosis is linked to infertility. There are many confounding issues including the fact that hysterectomy is required for definitive diagnosis, endometriosis commonly coexists, and most evidence comes from small cases series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, in a study of baboons, lifelong infertility was strongly associated (20-fold increased odds) with histological adenomyosis even when concomitant endometriosis was excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Most women with this disorder have another pathologic process in the uterus that often obscures the diagnosis of adenomyosis, and makes the delineation of a symptom profile for &quot;pure&quot; adenomyosis difficult. In one review, as an example, leiomyomas, endometriosis, and endometrial polyps were also present in 50, 11, and 7 percent, respectively, of women with adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In another study, adenomyosis was suspected on MRI in up to 90 percent of women with endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence that uterine adenomyosis affects the risk of spontaneous abortion or other obstetric outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of adenomyosis can only be made from histological examination of a hysterectomy specimen. The preoperative diagnosis is suggested by characteristic clinical manifestations (ie, menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea with a uniformly enlarged uterus) in the absence of endometriosis or leiomyomas.</p><p>Both transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially T2-weighted images, are increasingly used for clinical decision-making. In a review of 23 articles, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for diagnosing adenomyosis was 77 percent and 89 percent, as compared with 72 percent and 81 percent for ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Visual evidence for adenomyosis with both modalities includes (1) asymmetric thickening of the myometrium (with the posterior myometrial typically thicker), (2) myometrial cysts, (3) linear striations radiating out from the endometrium, (4) loss of a clear endomyometrial border, and (5) increased myometrial heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. With MRI, some quantitation of the thickening of the junctional zone is possible with &gt;12 mm generally considered diagnostic of the disease and &lt;8 mm excluding adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>There is no standard for determining when the threshold is met for an image-based diagnosis of adenomyosis. There has been some discussion that thickening of the junctional zone (termed junctional zone hyperplasia) or endometrial subendometrial myometrium unit disruption (which includes disruption, as well as thickening of the junctional zone) may be either distinct clinical entities or early manifestations of adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. However, studies on the natural history of adenomyosis are lacking.</p><p>Given the limited treatment options, MR is best used when trying to exclude malignant uterine neoplasia. It can also be used to distinguish diffuse and focal adenomyosis from leiomyomas, when an accurate diagnosis is important to determine management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The thickening of the junctional zone, characteristic of adenomyosis, can be confused with thickened endometrium in some imaging reports. Thus, clinically, the diagnosis of adenomyosis should be considered when scant tissue is obtained following an endometrial biopsy of thickened endometrium.</p><p>The only study on use of computed tomography for diagnosis of adenomyosis showed poor diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Sensitivity of needle biopsy depends upon several factors, including the extent of disease, number of biopsy specimens obtained, sampling site, needle gauge, and operator experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Needle biopsy is not a common practice and is reserved for clinical situation in which a malignancy needs to be excluded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy must always be excluded in women with abnormal uterine bleeding, especially when the uterus is also enlarged. In addition, a significant number of premenopausal women who complain of abnormal genital tract bleeding have anatomic problems within the uterus, such as polyps (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial polyps&quot;</a>), submucous myomata, endometrial hyperplasia, synechiae, adenocarcinoma, or infection (endometritis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adenomyosis may be strongly suspected in women with abnormal uterine bleeding and a diffusely enlarged uterus, and the diagnosis may be confirmed by MR imaging. In the absence of this specific constellation of findings, women with abnormal uterine bleeding require a general evaluation for the many different causes of this symptom. They are not initially evaluated specifically for adenomyosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The causes of secondary dysmenorrhea are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78903 \">table 1</a>). Often these disorders can be excluded based upon appropriate imaging studies, laparoscopy, laboratory examination, or relief of symptoms with empiric therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) It is also becoming evident that women with persistent pain following adequate treatment for endometriosis may have adenomyosis as an underlying diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only guaranteed treatment for adenomyosis is total hysterectomy. Since disease is confined to the uterus, ovarian conservation can be employed. There are no large or controlled studies of medical or limited surgical therapy for this disease.</p><p>Hormonal manipulation with progestins (including the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device [LNg IUD], gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, or aromatase inhibitors) may be effective for reducing menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea, as in endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]. A single case of successful treatment with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>-containing IUD has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Although one study observed a 24 percent reduction in the thickness of the junctional zone on MR after six months of use of the LNg IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], enlargement of the uterus and recurrence of symptoms are usually documented within six months after cessation of hormonal therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While estrogen-progestin contraceptives are frequently used as primary treatment for dysmenorrhea, there is little data on the efficacy of these contraceptives specifically for adenomyosis. One small randomized trial showed that both combined oral contraceptives and the LNg IUD resulted in decreased pain and bleeding compared to baseline, but the LNg IUD produced great reductions in both parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Conservative surgery using endomyometrial ablation or resection, laparoscopic myometrial electrocoagulation, or excision of adenomyosis has been helpful in some patients, although follow-up has been restricted to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Reports of radiofrequency ablation, both delivered transcervically with ultrasound guidance and via laparoscopy, suggest some efficacy at 12 months, but additional study is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>As discussed previously, there is not a plane separating adenomyotic tissue from normal myometrium so that surgical excision akin to myomectomy is performed with difficulty. Furthermore, the consistency of the adenomyotic uterus is described as &quot;woody&quot; and suturing is difficult in this environment. An observational study suggested that the combination of conservative surgery and GnRH medical therapy following treatment may be superior to surgery alone for symptom control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] and there is increasing innovation in endoscopic surgical approaches to adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has also been successful in resolving symptoms in some women. Several studies show small case series with symptomatic adenomyosis diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. While clinical follow-up shows clinical improvement in heavy menstrual bleeding or validated quality-of-life instruments, there is a high rate of additional intervention for persistent or recurrent symptoms. In one series, pathological examination of five uteruses revealed viable foci of adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Another study performed UAE on 19 patients with symptomatic pure or dominant adenomyosis on MRI; all had repeat MRI four months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Uterine volume decreased significantly after UAE (mean uterine volume reduction 25.1 percent). Sixteen of 18 patients who completed a questionnaire at three months reported an improvement in symptoms, and two reported no change. Eleven patients also completed a questionnaire at 12 months; 10 still reported continued improvement, and one patient reported a worsening of symptoms.</p><p>The largest study followed 54 women for at least three years (3.5 to 5.8 years) following UAE, and found that approximately two thirds of the women had long-term decreases in symptom severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Symptom severity decreased by about half in this study and baseline clinical factors did not appear to predict success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>There has been limited experience with treatment outcomes following MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery for adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. In the case report, there was an initial symptomatic response followed by a spontaneous pregnancy and term vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-adenomyosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Outcomes for the case series are reported only at six months, but there were both symptom improvement and volume reduction.</p><p>Based on these findings, hysterectomy still appears to be the treatment of choice for women with significant symptoms who have completed childbearing. However, for young women with extensive adenomyosis, who decline hysterectomy, exploration of alternative treatments for symptomatic relief is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3596649118\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The ectopic endometrial tissue appears to induce hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the surrounding myometrium, which results in a diffusely enlarged uterus (often termed &quot;globular&quot; enlargement) analogous to the concentric enlargement of the pregnant uterus. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of adenomyosis is suggested by characteristic clinical manifestations (ie, menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea with a uniformly enlarged uterus) in the absence of endometriosis or leiomyomas. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for diagnosis of adenomyosis are 77 percent and 89 percent. However, MRI is expensive. The sensitivity and specificity for transvaginal ultrasonography are 72 percent and 81 percent. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial biopsy is often normal because the abnormality is in the myometrium, not the endometrium. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of adenomyosis can only be made from histological examination of hysterectomy specimens. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy is the treatment of choice for women with significant symptoms.
