Neutropenia and glucocorticoid use are the most common predisposing factors. The infecting species is most commonly <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, but other species, including <em>A. flavus</em>, <em>A. terreus</em>, and <em>A. niger</em>, also cause disease. The effective management of invasive aspergillosis includes strategies to optimize prevention and early antifungal treatment, immunomodulation, and, in some cases, surgery.</p><p>The treatment and prevention of invasive aspergillosis will be reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis are discussed separately; treatment of the other manifestations of <em>Aspergillus</em> infection is also presented elsewhere.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for treatment of fungal infections in adult pulmonary and critical care patients in 2011; the ATS recommendations for the management of invasive aspergillosis are generally similar to those of the IDSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Links to guidelines are provided separately. (See <a href=\"#H2531985426\" class=\"local\">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p>Our recommendations agree with the recommendations in the IDSA and ATS with regard to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> being an essential element of therapy for most patients. The IDSA guidelines recommend voriconazole as initial therapy of invasive aspergillosis, with consideration of combination therapy with voriconazole plus an echinocandin for initial therapy of severe disease, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in those with profound and persistent neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We suggest combination therapy with voriconazole plus an echinocandin for patients with severe, microbiologically documented invasive aspergillosis (ie, diagnosed by culture, galactomannan antigen, or histopathology). The data regarding combination therapy are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H617537\" class=\"local\">'Voriconazole and an echinocandin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1842821051\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to management in this topic review is intended to apply to the various clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis. The most common clinical manifestation of invasive aspergillosis is pulmonary disease, but other manifestations include central nervous system infection, rhinosinusitis, endocarditis, gastrointestinal disease, and others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Optimal management involves early diagnosis and early initiation of antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to antifungal therapy, surgery should be considered for patients with certain manifestations. Reduction of immunosuppression, when feasible, is another important component of management. Surgery and reduction of immunosuppression are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Role of surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3007691222\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of immunosuppression'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5048311\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three classes of antifungal agents are available for the treatment of aspergillosis: polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins. Appropriate therapy for aspergillosis depends upon the host's immune status, organ function (kidney and liver), and prior therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6016511\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the recommendations in this topic review are intended to apply to the various clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis, the most common of which is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. An exception is <em>Aspergillus</em> endophthalmitis, which is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of endophthalmitis due to molds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For initial therapy of severe invasive aspergillosis diagnosed by culture, galactomannan antigen, or histopathology, we suggest combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> and an echinocandin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, some experts prefer monotherapy with voriconazole because of the absence of definitive data. The decision of whether to give combination therapy should be weighed against the risk of toxicities and the feasibility of intravenous therapy. (See <a href=\"#H617537\" class=\"local\">'Voriconazole and an echinocandin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are intolerant of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> due to severe reactions, we would choose either a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (eg, AmBisome or Abelcet) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a>, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015. The decision of which agent to choose depends on organ dysfunction, toxicities, and tolerability. For patients with severe hepatotoxicity or when there is concern for drug interactions between azoles (as a class) and other agents, we typically switch to a lipid formulation of amphotericin B. Although there is little experience to date with isavuconazole, we would consider using it instead of voriconazole or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B in patients who have renal dysfunction and cannot receive intravenous (IV) voriconazole due to its cyclodextrin vehicle (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Voriconazole'</a>). Neurologic and visual toxicities associated with voriconazole are frequently transient with early dosing; a change in therapy should be made only with persistent or particularly severe symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Lipid formulations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H263421065\" class=\"local\">'Isavuconazole'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an invasive mold infection is suspected but the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis has not been established, particularly in those who have recently received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, one should consider treating empirically with a lipid formulation of amphotericin B in order to provide antifungal activity against both aspergillosis and mucormycosis, since the Mucorales are intrinsically resistant to voriconazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. When the diagnosis is uncertain, further diagnostic studies should be pursued aggressively even after empiric therapy has been initiated. If the diagnosis of aspergillosis is established, we suggest switching to a voriconazole-based regimen, with addition of an echinocandin for those with severe disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucormycosis-zygomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to note that some drugs, especially azoles, interact with chemotherapy used in conditioning regimens, potentially increasing toxicities (eg, neurotoxicity from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>) or reducing the efficacy of certain cytotoxic drugs. If a patient is receiving interacting chemotherapeutic agents, then a non-interacting mold-active antifungal agent should be given.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to consider the species of <em>Aspergillus </em>when choosing initial therapy, since antifungal resistance is detected with increasing frequency and is more likely to occur with certain <em>Aspergillus</em> species. For example, <em>Aspergillus calidoustus </em>has high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to numerous antifungals and <em>A. terreus</em> has high MICs to amphotericin B. A combination of drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> and an echinocandin) may be considered for infection caused by these species, and antifungal susceptibility testing may help guide choices of antifungal agents. (See <a href=\"#H19379070\" class=\"local\">'Antifungal resistance'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antifungal-susceptibility-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antifungal susceptibility testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19377977\"><span class=\"h3\">Salvage therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An individualized approach should be taken in patients with refractory or progressive invasive aspergillosis and in patients in whom infection has emerged or progressed despite antifungal prophylaxis; the rapidity, severity, and extent of infection should be considered, and the emergence of a new pathogen should be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The approach to such patients should include altering the antifungal regimen (ideally changing the class of antifungal), reducing immunosuppression when feasible, and surgical resection of necrotic lesions in some cases.</p><p>For salvage therapy in patients who do not respond to monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a>, we suggest the use of a combination antifungal regimen. In such patients, we suggest adding an echinocandin, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caspofungin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a>, to voriconazole, isavuconazole, or liposomal amphotericin B. There are no clinical data to support the use of amphotericin B with triazoles for combination therapy, and many cases of failure are due to immunologic failure rather than drug failure. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Echinocandins'</a> below and <a href=\"#H617537\" class=\"local\">'Voriconazole and an echinocandin'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiple members of the <em>A. fumigatus</em> species complex exhibit high MICs to azoles (eg, <em>Aspergillus lentulus</em>), and <em>A. fumigatus</em> <em>stricto sensu </em>can acquire resistance to azoles by mutations in the drug target; although described, these organisms appear to be uncommon in the United States. In patients with documented infection who do not respond to initial monotherapy, not only should a combination therapy be given, but antifungal resistance testing should also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H19379070\" class=\"local\">'Antifungal resistance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19379957\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing and drug effects</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> &ndash; Voriconazole is available in both intravenous and oral formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. The recommended dosing regimen is 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously every 12 hours on day 1 followed by 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours thereafter. When the patient is able to take oral medications, one can consider switching to the oral form. Optimal oral dosing is a matter of controversy. The currently recommended dose of 200 mg orally every 12 hours has been noted to result in low or even unmeasurable serum concentrations in a substantial proportion of patients, and high concentrations may be associated with excessive toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The dose of oral voriconazole can be increased to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally every 12 hours (or 300 mg orally every 12 hours) in patients with disease progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest monitoring serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> trough concentrations in all patients receiving voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis. We suggest checking a trough concentration five to seven days into therapy. A goal of achieving serum trough concentrations &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and &lt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but we prefer concentrations between 2 and 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. Trough concentrations below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> warrant an increase in the voriconazole dose and appropriate subsequent monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On the other hand, serum drug concentrations above 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> warrant a reduction in the voriconazole dose because they have been associated with an increased risk of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].
