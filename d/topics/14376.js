In the early 1970s, Paul Lauterbur and Raymond Damadian applied nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology to the imaging of living organisms, generating images referred to as zeugmatographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Subsequent refinements in image acquisition and processing, developed by Sir Peter Mansfield and others, allowed improved visualization of anatomic detail and broader clinical application of MR imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/1,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-8</a>]. Lauterbur and Mansfield were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for their contributions to medical imaging.</p><p>This topic will review the principles of magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical applications of MR are discussed in individual topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MR PHYSICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atoms are characterized by mass, electrical charge, and a magnetic property called spin. Atomic nuclei that contain an odd number of protons or neutrons possess a magnetic moment, which describes the strength and direction of a microscopic magnetic field surrounding the nucleus. In the presence of a strong, constant external magnetic field, such as that produced inside an imaging magnet, a small excess fraction of nuclei, on average, align themselves with the magnetic field, producing a macroscopic, measurable magnetic moment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66019 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>In addition, the interaction between the magnetic moment of the nucleus and the external field causes each spinning nucleus to precess (ie, change the orientation of the rotation axis of the spinning nucleus). Each nucleus precesses at a characteristic (resonant) frequency that is proportional to the strength of the external field. The resonant frequency can be calculated with the Larmor equation: </p><p>Resonant frequency F = B<sub>0</sub> x Larmor constant</p><p>where B<sub>0</sub> is the magnetic field strength and the Larmor constant (also called gyromagnetic ratio or gamma) is the specific precession frequency of hydrogen at a specified magnetic field strength. For example, a hydrogen nucleus (a proton) precesses at a frequency of 42.57 MHz per Tesla (1 Tesla = 10,000 times the earth's magnetic field strength). At 1.5 Tesla, the Larmor frequency of hydrogen is 63 MHz and at 3 Tesla, 126 MHz. Because of the high abundance of hydrogen (<sup>1</sup>H) nuclei in tissue compared with other atomic nuclei, the proton signal from <strong>hydrogen</strong> is used in virtually all clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. It is estimated that one volume element (voxel) contains 10<sup>18</sup> water molecules.</p><p>The fraction of protons aligned with the magnetic field can be perturbed by application of radiofrequency energy at the resonant frequency. In essence, the applied radiofrequency pulse induces the protons in the volume of interest to spin at the Larmor (resonant) frequency. The density of protons as well as the rate at which the magnetization returns to equilibrium (relaxation) can then be measured by the radiofrequency signal or echo emitted by the protons (referred to as &quot;spins&quot;) as they relax. Two forms of relaxation can be measured:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation produced by realignment of the net magnetization vector with the external field (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53513%7EPULM%2F74502\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53513 graphicRef74502 \">figure 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation produced by loss of phase coherence of spins in a plane perpendicular to the external field (spin-spin or transverse relaxation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62262%7EPULM%2F78829\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62262 graphicRef78829 \">figure 3A-B</a>).</p><p/><p>Phase coherence refers to a collection of neighboring spins whose magnetization vectors point in the same direction. Loss of phase coherence occurs when these vectors get out of alignment due to precession of neighboring spins at slightly different velocities, reflecting small, random variations in the local magnetic field. Both longitudinal and transverse relaxation occur at exponential rates, with time constants T1 for longitudinal and T2 for transverse relaxation. T1 is the time needed for the magnetization vector to realign with the longitudinal axis of the main magnetic field. T2 is the time needed for the decay of the transverse magnetization. These time constants, T1 and T2, in turn depend on the local chemical microenvironment, which varies between tissues.</p><p>The power of magnetic resonance is based on small differences in the microenvironment of different tissues that can be detected by pulse sequences designed to emphasize T1, T2, or proton density differences. The presence of multiple magnetic resonance properties of tissue leads to great flexibility in determining tissue contrast, based upon the choice of imaging sequence. This capability is superior to computed tomography (CT), in which only a single property of tissue (electron density) is exploited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MR IMAGING TECHNOLOGY AND PULSE SEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appearance and signal intensity of tissues in a magnetic resonance (MR) image depend heavily upon the type of imaging technique used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnet and coil design</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MR imaging requires a large, constant, spatially homogeneous magnetic field. Most clinical MR imaging systems use a superconducting magnet to generate the required magnetic field. The superconducting magnet is composed of windings of special metal alloys (niobium-titanium fibers in an aluminum or copper matrix) cooled by liquid helium, in which electrical current flows without loss of energy. The circular flow of electrical current in the windings induces a constant magnetic field oriented along the bore of the magnet. Additional complex windings are incorporated to allow application of small correction fields, improving field homogeneity. Alternative magnet technologies in clinical use include permanent and resistive magnets, which are generally of lower field strength than superconducting magnets. </p><p>The majority of clinical MRI systems are based on cylindrical bore magnets, in which the main magnetic field is oriented parallel to the bore. Imaging speed and resolution is defined by magnet strength, which is 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla in most clinical scanners. Open or large bore scanners are available for large and claustrophobic patients and for image-guided interventional procedures, but magnet strength for these systems are &le;1.5 Tesla, which limits image quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A specialized self-contained 1.0 Tesla scanner is also available in some neonatal intensive care units to allow head imaging of infants in temperature controlled incubators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Four or more additional windings (or coils) are incorporated in an imaging magnet. Three gradient coils are used to create small linear perturbations of the magnetic field in orthogonal spatial directions. Because the proton precession frequency is linearly related to magnetic field strength, these magnetic gradients can encode the spatial location of protons within the body by the frequency of precession. A radiofrequency (RF) coil is used to provide the bursts of RF energy required to perturb the magnetization of spins within the body. Most MRI systems have a &quot;whole body&quot; RF coil permanently installed next to the gradient coils. This provides homogeneous RF excitation of a large volume of tissue within the magnet bore. Although the same RF coil can be used to receive the echo signal(s) from the body, in most cases smaller coils, tailored to different body parts, are connected via electrical cable to the radiofrequency (RF) system and placed in close proximity to the body part being imaged. </p><p>Although a full discussion of the physics of coil design is beyond the scope of this chapter, the general principles guiding coil design are: (1) closer proximity to the body part being imaged increases signal; (2) unwanted RF noise is proportional to the volume of sensitivity of a coil; RF contamination can lead to so-called zipper artifacts in MR images; (3) it is possible to create one large coil out of many small coils with the low RF noise of a small coil, provided that each coil element has its own independent RF channel. Modern MRI scanners typically use multielement coils coupled to multichannel RF systems (multi-array coils), improving the signal-to-noise ratio over single channel designs. Some coils are also able to provide the RF excitation pulses, which can be helpful in limiting the overall power deposition into (heating of) the body.</p><p>The field of view prescribed in image acquisition is important. If the field of view is too small and leads to undersampling of data, aliasing and so-called wrap-around artifacts ensue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The remainder of the MR imaging system consists of a patient transport system (the table), RF and magnetic shielding, MR-compatible electrocardiographic and respiratory monitoring systems, and a computer to set up the pulse sequences, perform collection of the echo data, and transform the raw data into images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82585 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse sequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike computed tomography, where tissue contrast depends almost entirely on electron density, contrast in MR imaging is a complex function of proton density, T1 relaxation, and T2 relaxation and chemical environment. The relative contributions of these parameters to the image vary with the manner in which the tissue is excited. The combination of RF and gradient waveforms used to obtain an image is referred to as a pulse sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For thoracic imaging, the most commonly used pulse sequence is called &quot;spin echo&quot; or &quot;black blood imaging.&quot; For specific applications, such as imaging blood flow or rapid imaging, eg, cardiac imaging, other types of pulse sequences are employed, as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Spin echo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spin echo (SE) pulse sequence consists of a 90 degree RF pulse to excite the tissue followed by a 180 degree refocusing pulse. The refocusing pulse reverses any dephasing effects that have occurred due to heterogeneities in the external magnetic field, forming an RF &quot;echo&quot; when the spins come back into phase. The elapsed time from the 90 degree pulse to the peak of the echo is called the echo time (TE). The elapsed time between successive 90 degree pulses is called the repetition time (TR). A spin echo sequence with a short TR (eg, 300 msec to 1000 msec) and a short TE (less than 20 msec) emphasizes the T1 differences between tissues (T1-weighting). A spin-echo sequence with a long TR (3000 to 6000 msec) and a long TE (greater than 80 msec) emphasizes T2 differences (T2-weighting). A long TR sequence with a short TE minimizes the effects of T1 and T2 relaxation and thus reflects proton density, which in turn primarily reflects water content. In order to increase the image contrast, inversion recovery pulses can be added.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Gradient echo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequence, also called &quot;bright blood imaging,&quot; consists of small angle (typically 20 to 60 degrees) RF pulses applied in rapid succession (TR less than 100 msec). Gradient echo imaging uses a reversal of the magnetic field gradients rather than a 180 degree RF pulse to refocus spins. Image contrast in gradient echo imaging is a complex function of TR, TE, and RF flip angle, but the imaging parameters can be adjusted to produce T1, T2, and proton density weighting similar to spin echo sequences. Gradient echo sequences generally can suffer from susceptibility artifacts related to magnetic field inhomogeneity, and disturbances in resonant frequency with subsequent loss of signal, when compared with spin echo sequences, but are more efficient, ie, more information is acquired per unit time. Therefore, gradient echo sequences are often used for very fast imaging or 3D volumetric imaging, in which data from an entire volume are acquired with nearly isotropic voxels, rather than the typical 2D sequences, in which the slice thickness is much greater than the in-slice pixel dimensions. Examples of gradient echo sequences include spoiled gradient echo imaging and balanced steady state free precession. Gradient echo imaging in the thorax is preferentially used in fast imaging, angiographic imaging, and cardiac imaging.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With fast, spoiled-gradient imaging or single-shot imaging, images are obtained much more rapidly than with an equivalent spin-echo sequence. As a result, individual images can be acquired during a single breath-hold, which improves image quality due to elimination of respiratory motion artifacts. The transverse magnetization returns to zero prior to each radiofrequency pulse. In addition, the temporal pattern of enhancement of tissues following intravenous contrast material injection can be assessed by repetitive rapid imaging at one or more locations, a procedure useful in the imaging of tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) uses ultrafast acquisition of T1-weighted three-dimensional gradient echo data sets obtained during a breath-hold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this setting, magnetization of stationary tissue within the imaged slice becomes partially &quot;saturated,&quot; leading to decreased signal. Blood flowing into the imaged slice, however, will not have experienced repetitive excitations and therefore will generate higher signal intensity. The pulse sequence design for contrast-enhanced MRA is based on a three-dimensional Fourier transform gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence, using rapid radiofrequency pulsing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The excellent contrast between the bright blood and darker stationary tissue makes gradient echo a useful angiographic sequence for imaging of arterial and venous structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p>Balanced steady-state free precession is preferentially used for cine MR imaging of the heart and coronary arteries. In contrast to fast gradient imaging, the transverse magnetization reaches a steady-state. Its signal is dependent on the relaxation time ratio between T2 and T1 and it provides excellent contrast between the blood and the endocardium, while being independent of contrast from blood flow and its artifacts.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Other sequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an effort to achieve the most rapid imaging possible, various pulse sequences have been developed, all of which have in common the collection of a large amount of data in the form of multiple echoes following each RF excitation. Fast spin echo is an often used modification of the spin echo sequence in which multiple 180 degree refocusing pulses follow a single 90 degree excitation. Fast spin echo can reduce the time required to produce a set of images by a factor equal to the number of refocusing pulses (the echo train length) applied. Fast spin echo is often used in the thorax to allow spin echo imaging with breath-holding. In the most extreme form of rapid imaging, called echo planar imaging, all of the data needed to reconstruct a single two-dimensional slice are acquired after a single RF pulse, in a time as short as 30 to 40 msec [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Echo-planar technique can be used for perfusion imaging of tissues after injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents, eg, in myocardial perfusion studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic stress CMR'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MAGNETIC RESONANCE CONTRAST AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paramagnetic contrast agents, usually administered intravenously, have assumed a role in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging similar to that played by iodinated contrast agents in computed tomography (CT) imaging. Most MR contrast agents in clinical use are chelates of gadolinium. After intravenous injection, these agents initially partition into the vascular space, and then diffuse into the extravascular space. Gadolinium, a paramagnetic element with seven unpaired electrons, influences the surrounding water molecules, resulting in an increased relaxivity with shortening of both T1 and T2; it is primarily the T1-shortening effect that is clinically relevant at typical tissue concentrations of contrast agent. On T1-weighted images, relatively greater delivery of contrast material to a region, eg, due to increased vascularity or trapping of gadolinium in myocardial infarcts, scars, inflammation or infiltration, produces an increase in T1-weighted signal intensity over baseline.</p><p>MR contrast agent safety is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'MR contrast agent'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MOTION COMPENSATION TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relatively long time required to collect all the data necessary to reconstruct an image renders magnetic resonance (MR) imaging susceptible to motion artifacts, so-called ghosting artifacts. The types of motion encountered include cardiac, respiratory, flowing blood, swallowing, peristalsis, and gross patient movements. Motion artifacts tend to be most noticeable along the position-encoding axis, determined by the phase of the received echo signal. Judicious choice of the phase-encoding axis is helpful in minimizing motion artifact in an area of clinical interest. Most clinical MR imaging systems now have rapid imaging options, which typically can acquire all data in a breathhold, albeit with somewhat reduced spatial resolution <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signal-to-noise ratio. This can obviate the need for motion compensation and has become common for MR imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.</p><p>More sophisticated techniques are also available to compensate for predictable, repetitive forms of motion, such as cardiac motion, respiratory motion, and blood flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac gating</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artifacts created by cardiac motion can be minimized if pulses are synchronized with the cardiac cycle. This requires an electrocardiographic- or pulse-monitoring system. To achieve T1-weighting, repetition time (TR) is usually set to one R-R interval. For T2-weighting (long TR), TR is chosen to be a multiple of an R-R interval. Because of the dominant effects of cardiac motion in the chest, virtually all thoracic imaging is performed with either prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering or retrospective ECG cardiac gating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory compensation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, the phase encoding gradient is incremented sequentially on successive radiofrequency (RF) excitations until sufficient data are collected to perform Fourier reconstruction. Respiratory compensation consists of monitoring the respiratory cycle with a flexible belt placed around the patient, and reordering the phase encoding gradients such that adjacent phase encodes occur during similar degrees of inspiration. In the reconstruction process, the data are reordered to make it appear that only one very long respiratory cycle was sampled. This greatly reduces respiratory motion artifact without changing imaging time. This type of motion compensation is therefore used routinely in thoracic imaging.</p><p>Periodic respiratory motion can be synchronized by adding a navigator pulse to the pulse-sequence. This approach entails the application of a small, one-dimensional spatial encoding gradient in a plane perpendicular to the diaphragm. It ensures that only imaging data acquired in expiration with the diaphragm in its most cranial position are utilized for the reconstruction of the permanent image.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Flow compensation (gradient moment nulling)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motion occurring between the application of RF excitation and reception of the echo causes changes in the phase of the received signal from the moving tissue, thereby causing misregistration of position along the phase-encoding axis. This artifact can be minimized by altering the gradient waveforms in the slice-selective and frequency-encoding axes to produce no net phase-shift for constant velocity motion, a technique called flow-compensation (referring to blood flow) or gradient moment nulling (GMN).</p><p>GMN produces an increase in signal within blood vessels, and is therefore used routinely in angiographic (gradient echo) sequences. The GMN gradient waveforms increase the minimum achievable TE, which reduces signal-to-noise ratio in short echo time (TE) (T1- and proton density-weighted images). It is generally less effective than respiratory compensation in reducing breathing motion artifact, and its use in spin-echo imaging is therefore limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPATIAL AND CHEMICAL PRESATURATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spatial presaturation refers to spatially-selective prepulses applied immediately before the imaging pulse sequence to reduce signal arising from undesired spatial locations. Its main use is in reducing artifact from flowing blood on spin-echo images, but the concept is also used for suppression of respiratory motion artifact. Chemical presaturation (FAT SAT or CHEM SAT) uses a spectrally-selective prepulse to reduce or eliminate signal from fat, taking advantage of the fact that protons bound to fat molecules resonate at a slightly different frequency than water protons, a phenomenon known as chemical shift.</p><p>Chemical shift artifacts can lead to so-called India ink margins in affected images.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Suppression of signal from flowing blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In conventional multislice spin-echo imaging, the region outside the imaged volume does not absorb radiofrequency (RF) energy, and spins from this region are therefore fully relaxed (maximum magnetic moment). If these spins flow into the imaged volume during data acquisition, ie, arterial or venous inflow, they will generate relatively high signal intensity and will also produce phase-shift artifacts. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Flow compensation (gradient moment nulling)'</a> above.)</p><p>This undesired blood flow artifact can be suppressed by presaturating the nonimaged volume with a 90 degree RF excitation and randomizing the phase of these spins with a large magnetic field gradient, at a small cost in increased imaging time. Spatial presaturation is routinely used in spin-echo thoracic imaging sequences to reduce blood flow artifact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Suppression of respiratory motion artifact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppression of respiratory motion artifact can be achieved by presaturating the anterior chest wall to reduce its emitted signal. This type of saturation within the imaged slice is used mainly in conjunction with surface phased-array coils. These receiver coils greatly increase the signal-to-noise ratio obtained per unit of imaging time; however, they suffer from nonuniform spatial sensitivity. Thus, signal from protons close to the coil, ie, the chest wall, is received with greater efficiency than signal from protons deep within the thorax. Spatial presaturation can deemphasize the signal from the chest wall and therefore reduce respiratory artifact arising from the chest wall as well. The main limitation of spatial presaturation for this application is that only a linear band of tissue can be suppressed with a single pulse. To suppress signal from the entire chest cage, multiple presaturation pulses must be applied, at a greater cost in imaging time.</p><p>Navigator gating of the diaphragmatic movements can effectively freeze respiratory motion while the patient is freely breathing and is a newer technique for suppression of respiratory motion artifacts.</p><p>Single shot sequences acquire each section during a single breathhold with data acquired during each heart beat or every other heart beat in cardiac imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Suppression of signal from fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, chemical-shift fat suppression is commonly used to reduce the high signal intensity of fat-containing tissues. This comes at a modest cost in imaging time. Chemical fat suppression is effective but relies on a high degree of magnetic field homogeneity within the imaged volume: Since the difference in resonant frequency of water and fat protons is only 3.5 parts per million, any variation in the magnetic field of this order or larger will cause uneven fat suppression. The problem is exacerbated on lower field strength imaging systems since the fat-selective prepulses have a finite bandwidth that is more likely to overlap the water resonance frequency due to the very narrow difference in resonant frequencies.</p><p>A common alternative method of fat suppression is known as STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery), which exploits the fact that the relaxation time of fat protons is much shorter than water protons. By exciting all tissue within a volume to invert the magnetization (180 degree inversion or presaturation pulse), followed by a delay chosen when fat protons have no net magnetic moment, followed by a 90 degree pulse and then readout pulses, signal from fat can be suppressed without requiring high field homogeneity. The main disadvantage of this method over chemical fat suppression is that it is slower.</p><p>Use of fat suppression within the thorax enables tissue characterization when a fat-containing lesion is suspected (either method effective), and facilitates differentiation of fat from contrast enhancement after intravenous contrast administration, where enhancing tissue and nonsuppressed fat may approach equal signal intensity (only CHEM SAT effective).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PRACTICAL ASPECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the magnetic resonance (MR) examination, the patient typically lies supine on a sliding table, which is advanced into the bore of the magnet for imaging. Since noise levels can be high during imaging due to vibration of the gradient coils, earplugs or specially designed in-ear audio systems are commonly used. An imaging sequence may be as short as one second or as long as 10 minutes, and the entire exam typically lasts 20 to 60 minutes as multiple imaging sequences are performed in multiple planes. More limited and rapid MRI examinations are sometimes used in the setting of trauma or with a patient unable to tolerate a more complete examination for whatever reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few contraindications to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging exist and no biological effects are associated with conventional MR imaging. Most contraindications are relative precautions, which can be divided into four groups: implanted devices and foreign bodies, unstable patients, pregnancy, and other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Prior to scanning, a thorough safety screen of each patient for any implanted, embedded, or attached devices or foreign objects is mandatory. Screening should include taking a history for possible intraorbital or intraocular metallic fragments, such as might become lodged during machining. Patients are generally asked to remove jewelry and clothing containing metallic components and change into a gown.</p><p>Magnetizable materials and electronic devices represent potential hazards to the patient.

In general, if a device is nonferromagnetic and no concerns associated with MR-related heating arise, MR imaging may be performed immediately after implantation. For some weakly ferromagnetic devices, data and consensus are sufficient to support a recommendation that MR examination can be performed any time after implantation. For other weakly ferromagnetic devices, the writing group recommended weighing the risks and benefits of scanning on an individual basis. In some cases (eg, those with acute indications), clear potential benefit to scanning within days to weeks after device implantation may be present, while in other cases when the indication for scanning is not very time sensitive; it may be prudent to defer MR examination until approximately six weeks after implantation (based on the general belief that tissue healing occurring over weeks may aid in device anchoring).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary artery and peripheral vascular stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 consensus document noted that most coronary artery stents and peripheral vascular stents that have been tested have been labeled as &quot;MR safe&quot; and the remainder have been labeled as &quot;MR conditional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].&quot; Tested coronary artery stents (including tested drug-eluting coronary stents) and peripheral stents that are nonferromagnetic (includes all coronary artery stents in use in 2010) can be safely scanned at &le;3T any time after implantation. The timing of MR examination (from days to six weeks after implantation) at &le;3T for patients with peripheral stents that are weakly ferromagnetic should be decided on an individual basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic stent grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 consensus document noted that most aortic stent grafts that have been tested have been labeled as &quot;MR safe&quot; with the exception of the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft Stent, which has been labeled as MR unsafe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The Zenith stent has major deflection and torque of the stainless steel component of the graft in the magnetic field. Patients with nonferromagnetic stent grafts may be scanned at &le;3T at any time after implantation. The timing of MR examination at &le;3T for patients with weakly ferromagnetic aortic stent grafts should be decided on a case by case basis. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Timing of MR examination'</a> above.)</p><p>Most stent grafts cause minimal artifacts and allow visualization of endostent lumen and evidence of endostent leak. However, severe susceptibility artifacts have been reported with the Zenith AAA endovascular graft, Endologix AAA stent (Endologix), and Lifepath AAA stent (Edwards Lifesciences Corp); thus, MR is not the modality of choice for evaluation of these stent grafts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanical cardiac valves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 consensus document noted that the majority of prosthetic heart valves and annuloplasty rings have been labeled as &quot;MR safe&quot;; the remainder of tested heart valves and rings have been labeled as &quot;MR conditional&quot;.

Patients with nonferromagnetic devices may undergo MR examination at any time. It is advised that patients with weakly ferromagnetic devices (eg, Gianturco bird nest IVC filter [Cook]) or stainless steel Greenfield vena cava filter (Boston Scientific) wait at least six weeks before undergoing an MR examination, unless a strong clinical indication to perform the MR examination sooner is present. MR examination can be performed after six weeks, as long as there is no reason to suspect that the device is not positioned properly or that it is not firmly in place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Embolization coils</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 consensus document noted that most embolization coils that have been tested have been labeled as &quot;MR safe;&quot; the remainder of tested coils has been labeled as &quot;MR conditional.&quot; Patients with nonferromagnetic embolization coils may undergo MR examination any time after implantation.

In a prospective multicenter study, 1500 nonthoracic MRI examinations were performed in a 1.5T magnet on patients with a non-MRI-conditional pacemaker or ICD that had been programmed according to a standardized protocol; no device or lead failures were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similarly, no clinically significant events occurred at one year in a series of 1509 patients with non-MRI-conditional pacemakers or ICDs who underwent thoracic or non-thoracic MRI examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
