They encompass over 400 disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most are the result of genetic defects. Skeletal dysplasias can present any time from the prenatal period to adult life. The estimated incidence of skeletal dysplasias is approximately 15.7 in 100,000 births.</p><p>The classification of these disorders and the understanding of their pathophysiology have improved over time due to the advent of molecular studies and gene discoveries. This knowledge has contributed to the development of treatment options for specific skeletal dysplasias, such as achondroplasia, hypophosphatasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta.</p><p>A few of the most common conditions are reviewed in brief here, with some reviewed in greater detail separately. The diagnostic evaluation of the lethal and nonlethal skeletal dysplasias is discussed separately.

The most salient clinical features include disproportionate short stature, long bone shortening that predominantly affects the proximal aspects of the upper and lower extremities, and macrocephaly. Hypochondroplasia is another allelic disorder that is associated with <em>FGFR3</em> mutations, although the mutations in this disorder occur in the cytoplasmic (immunoglobulin-like) domain. These patients have milder clinical manifestations than achondroplasia, with some similar radiologic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achondroplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achondroplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2023346052\"><span class=\"h1\">DYSOSTOSIS MULTIPLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal changes can be seen in some storage metabolic disorders, such as the mucopolysaccharidoses, mucolipidoses, or gangliosidoses. In these conditions, the bone changes are secondary to progressive storage of complex carbohydrates (glycoproteins or glycolipids) slowly accumulating in the lysosomes and affecting cartilage and bones. This progressive accumulation leads to bone changes known as dysostosis multiplex. Dysostosis multiplex is evidenced by flattening of the vertebrae and, in some cases, anterior protrusion of the vertebral bodies. Other changes include widening of the ribs (paddle rib deformities) such as in mucolipidoses, long bone remodeling, and metacarpal proximal pointing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'MPS type IV (Morquio syndrome)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Hurler syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2537607461\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS AFFECTING BONE DENSITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2244055974\"><span class=\"h2\">Low bone density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders with low bone density and associated fragility are due to abnormalities in bone formation. As examples, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is due to defects in collagen or molecules that affect collagen processing that affect matrix formation, and hypophosphatasia (HPP) affects the formation of hydroxyapatite, which is needed for bone mineralization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3166729104\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteogenesis imperfecta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OI is a variable group of disorders associated with decreased bone density and is characterized by bone fragility, osteoporosis, bone deformities, and multiple fractures. The most frequent types are I through IV, which are associated with heterozygous mutations in alpha chains (alpha 1 and alpha 2) of the type I collagen gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other less frequent but severe forms of OI are found in association to recessive mutations involving <em>FKBP10, CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, SERPINF1, SERPINH1,</em> and <em>IFITM5, </em>many of which are type I collagen chaperon molecules associated with processing and trafficking (eg, posttranslational modification, procollagen folding, procollagen secretion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of OI are discussed in greater detail separately.

It is due to mutations in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase <em>(TNSALP)</em> gene that lead to low alkaline phosphatase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are two forms. The most severe forms of HPP are due to autosomal recessive mutations, while milder and often late-presenting forms are caused by autosomal dominant mutations of the <em>TNSALP</em> gene.</p><p>Patients with this disorder have abnormally low alkaline phosphatase, accumulation of inorganic pyrophosphate that inhibits bone mineralization, increased pyridoxal-5&rsquo;-phosphate (PLP; active form of B6), and elevated urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEP). Patients with HPP present with poor bone mineralization and progressive bone demineralization leading to recurrent fractures, bone pain, and short stature. In addition, common features include craniosynostosis, vitamin B6 responsive seizures, hypotonia, failure to thrive, respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">insufficiency/failure,</span> and atraumatic early loss of primary teeth (often with the intact root). Enzyme therapy replacement has been approved for the treatment of the early presentation forms (infantile and childhood forms).

Bone homeostasis depends upon the result of osteoblastic activity, when bone is laid out, versus osteoclastic activity, when bone is resorbed. Increased osteoblastic activity or decreased osteoclastic resorption leads to <span class=\"nowrap\">osteosclerosis/osteopetrosis</span> (increased bone density), in which bone becomes thicker, harder, and denser. There are multiple forms and types of osteopetrosis, most of them caused by poor or abnormal osteoclastic activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270595411\"><span class=\"h3\">Pyknodysostosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyknodysostosis is a rare, recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the cathepsin K (<em>CTSK</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These patients present with an abnormal skull, delayed closure of the fontanelles that persists throughout adult life, wormian bones, midface hypoplasia, abnormal dentition, short stature, osteopetrosis, and acroosteolysis (bony resorption of the terminal tuft of the distal phalanx) manifested by short phalanges more pronounced distally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Frequent fractures ensue after mild trauma. Conditions that increase bone density, such as pyknodysostosis or osteopetrosis, lead to fractures due to lack of bone flexibility. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the acclaimed French painter, was affected by pyknodysostosis and was known to have suffered hundreds of fractures throughout his lifetime.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1413507715\"><span class=\"h3\">Infantile malignant osteopetrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perhaps one of the best known and most severe forms of osteopetrosis is the autosomal recessive form caused by homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the carbonic anhydrase type II gene (<em>CA2</em>). This is also known as infantile malignant osteopetrosis and is associated with renal tubular acidosis (proximal and distal). The increase in bone density leads to progressive replacement of the bone marrow, with subsequent anemia and pancytopenia. Sclerosis of the skull may also cause compression of the cranial nerves, in particular the optic nerves. This condition is also associated with intellectual disability, short stature, and, in some cases, basal ganglia calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The etiology for the calcifications is unclear but is possibly related to secondary parathyroid dysfunction. High morbidity and early mortality are associated with this disorder.</p><p>Treatment is conservative and directed at managing complications such as anemia, renal involvement, fractures, and dental abnormalities. Hypocalcemia can sometimes be present in these patients since the calcium is trapped inside the bone. This may require supplementation with calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and, in some instances, calcitriol. High-dose calcitriol is no longer recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been used but proven ineffective, more so for those cases related to decrease in osteoclastic activity. Morbidity and mortality are significant in HCT secondary to graft-versus-host disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1875962079\"><span class=\"h3\">Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, type II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, type II (ADO II, also called Albers-Sch&ouml;nberg disease) is a form of osteopetrosis (increased bone density) caused by heterozygous mutations in the chloride channel 7 (<em>CLCN7</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This condition primarily affects the spine, the pelvis, and the base of the skull, although increased density is seen in other bones as well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108696\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108696 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108698\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108698 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108699\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108699 \">image 3</a>). Sclerotic rings in the iliac bones are seen in radiographs of the pelvis. Sometimes, bone-within-bone images can be seen in the pelvis and vertebral bodies on radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108696\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108696 \">image 1</a>). Sclerosis of the skull may lead to optic nerve compression or hearing loss and may involve other cranial nerves, such as the facial nerve. These patients are at risk for fractures and anemia secondary to bone marrow replacement. Compound heterozygous mutations in this gene can also cause severe infantile osteopetrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2606767817\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE II COLLAGEN DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type II collagen is a homotrimer composed of three collagen alpha-1 chains (COL2A1x3). It is abundantly present in tissues such as cartilage and vitreous humor. Disorders of type II collagen range widely in severity, from lethal conditions such as hypochondrogenesis to milder disorders such as Stickler syndrome and osteoarthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2805103699\"><span class=\"h2\">Kniest dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kniest dysplasia is a type II collagen disorder that is associated with disproportionate short stature. The phenotype of this disorder varies widely, ranging from severe with poor survival to mild.</p><p>Patients with Kniest dysplasia have marked shortening of the trunk, lumbar lordosis, and kyphoscoliosis. The final height can range from 106 to 145 cm (3 ft 6 in to 4 ft 9 in) for males and females depending upon the severity. In addition, they have severe joint contractures and stiffening. On exam, the face is flat, and cleft palate is a common finding. Eye findings include progressive and severe myopia, retinal detachment, vitreoretinal degeneration, and cataracts. Radiographs show a characteristic widening of the metaphyses (dumbbell shaped), hypoplasia of the pelvic bones, and flattening of the vertebral bodies with coronal clefts. Conductive and sensorineural hearing loss is common in these patients.</p><p>Frequent funduscopic exams and hearing evaluations are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2128502209\"><span class=\"h2\">Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SEDC) is a dwarfing condition associated with collagen, type II, alpha 1 (<em>COL2A1</em>) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. SEDC is clinically characterized by disproportionate short stature with a short trunk, short neck, small chest with a pear shape, pectus carinatum, scoliosis, micromelia (abnormally small limb[s]), congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), and midface hypoplasia. The trunk in these patients is disproportionately shorter than the extremities. The final height is approximately 130 cm (4 ft 3 in). As often seen in other type II collagenopathies, they may also present with cleft palate, retinal detachment, myopia, and hearing loss. On radiographs, vertebras have an ovoid shape with flattening and coronal clefting. Odontoid hypoplasia is also a common finding.</p><p>Follow-up of these patients includes eye exams for myopia and retinal detachment, cervical evaluations for odontoid hypoplasia that may necessitate surgery, and hearing evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2069754702\"><span class=\"h2\">Stickler syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stickler syndrome, often referred to as hereditary ophthalmoarthropathy or arthroophthalmopathy, is mostly due to defects in type II collagen. Molecularly, <em>COL2A1</em> mutations are found in 80 to 90 percent of patients. Most of the other 10 to 20 percent of patients have mutations in <em>COL11A1</em> (a type XI collagen chain), but other rare mutations reported include <em>COL11A2</em>, <em>COL9A1</em>, <em>COL9A2</em>, and <em>COL9A3</em> (type XI and type IX collagens).

At birth, these patients are often diagnosed with the Pierre Robin sequence (cleft palate, micrognathia, glossoptosis), and they typically have a flat midface. Stature is typically normal. Radiographs may show spine changes with platyspondyly and sometimes scoliosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Pierre Robin sequence'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with suspected and confirmed Stickler syndrome require careful funduscopic exams every 6 to 12 months due to the high risk for retinal detachment and myopia. In addition, hearing evaluations are recommended due to the presence of variable and often progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Mitral valve prolapse occurs in up to 50 percent of patients with Stickler; therefore, serial echocardiographs are recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902170800\"><span class=\"h1\">METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109477293\"><span class=\"h2\">Cartilage-hair hypoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the mitochondrial RNA-processing endoribonuclease gene <em>(RMRP</em> or<em> RNaseMRP) </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Clinically, CHH is characterized by disproportionate short stature with short limbs (short-limbed dwarfism), genu varum deformities (outward bowing of the leg), loose joints, long fibula compared with tibia, and poor hair growth or sparse hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Some of these children may have infrequent haircuts due to their hypotrichosis. Delays in early motor development are common due to joint laxity. In addition, late sitting and standing due to hip hypoplasia is sometimes observed. Median adult height is 130 cm (4 ft 3 in). Radiographs show generalized irregularities involving the long bone metaphyses with mild widening. Patients with CHH may have impaired cellular immunity and lymphopenia. An exaggerated reaction to chickenpox infections has been reported. These patients should be referred for immunologic evaluations, and live vaccines should be avoided. Other medical complications include Hirschsprung disease.

These patients show leg bowing and a waddling gait after they start walking. Thus, this disorder is typically detected after the second year of age. Coxa vara (decreased femoral neck shaft angle) and genu varum abnormalities are common. Radiographs show metaphyseal changes with cupping, splaying, and fraying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

This mutation causes independent activation of the G protein&ndash;coupled receptor for the PTH hormone in chondrocytes. Clinically, it presents with short-limb dwarfism with a final height that does not exceed 130 cm (4 ft 3 in). In addition, the joints are widened and have restricted mobility.

Craniofacial features include macrocephaly, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge with upturned nose, and micrognathia. Facial features have been referred to as fetal facies. Genitourinary anomalies may include micropenis and penoscrotal transposition; females may have clitoris hypoplasia. Renal anomalies may include hydronephrosis.</p><p>The autosomal dominant form of Robinow has similar but milder features than the recessive form and is caused by heterozygous mutations of the wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5A (<em>WNT5A</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The joints suffer from progressive degeneration, and most patients will require hip and other joint replacements. Odontoid hypoplasia is common and requires surveillance and ultimately C1 to C2 fusion. Radiologic findings include flattening of the vertebral bodies with anterior tonguing, small epiphyses, irregular metaphyses and epiphyses, and brachydactyly.

Different mutations in this gene, however, cause the autosomal recessive disorder known as diastrophic dysplasia. (See <a href=\"#H1219937384\" class=\"local\">'Diastrophic dysplasia'</a> below.)</p><p>MED is characterized by joint pain that may start in late childhood. The dominant form is the most common and presents in early childhood with hip and knee pain after activities, walking, and exercises.

This dwarfing condition can be diagnosed at birth or even prenatally. It is characterized by short stature, small chest, scoliosis, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, brachydactyly with ulnar deviation of the fingers, radial dislocation, hitchhiker&rsquo;s thumb, clubfeet, separation of the first and second toes, and contractures of the large joints. A typical finding at birth includes cystic swelling of the ears present neonatally that subsides with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Cleft palate is seen in one-third of patients. The trachea can be abnormally soft, leading to collapse that may complicate respiratory issues due to lung hypoplasia in the neonatal period. The joints are enlarged and have contractures. In addition, these patients have early onset of degenerative osteoarthritis. Cervical instability with kyphosis can be part of this diagnosis and requires monitoring and, in some cases, to prevent cord compression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2304954390\"><span class=\"h2\">Larsen syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two forms of Larsen syndrome, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive.

The dominant form presents with dislocations of the large joints, cervical instability with kyphosis that could lead to C2 through C4 subluxation, midface hypoplasia, cleft palate, cleft uvula, short distal phalanges, and clubfeet. The recessive entity is slightly different, with significant short stature and severe joint dislocations that are associated with a significant reduction in range of motion, progressive kyphosis, and scoliosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2816829322\"><span class=\"h2\">Acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the neuropilin 2 (<em>NRP2</em>) gene that encodes the transmembrane receptor for the cartilage natriuretic peptide (CNP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The diagnosis is evident in the first year or two of age. This dysplasia is characterized by disproportionate short stature, large head with prominent forehead, micromelia (shortened and abnormally formed extremities) with striking mesomelic and acromelic shortening, as well as kyphosis. The joints are lax, which may contribute to early delay of motor skills. The final adult height averages 122 cm (4 ft) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4059717673\"><span class=\"h2\">Chondrodysplasia punctata</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three different forms of chondrodysplasia (CDP).

A typical finding is the presence of punctate calcifications (stippling) in a number of joints at the growth plates and spine. These represent multiple additional epiphyseal calcifications that decrease with time as they incorporate into the epiphyses. The metaphyses near the large joints are cupped and frayed. Other features include intellectual disability, microcephaly, and congenital cataracts.</p><p>The X-linked dominant form of CDP occurs almost exclusively in females. The limbs are short and often asymmetric, with extra-epiphyseal punctate calcifications and variable joint contractures. These patients also have a low nasal bridge and midface hypoplasia.

The most salient clinical features include disproportionate short stature, long bone shortening that predominantly affects the proximal aspects of the upper and lower extremities, and macrocephaly. Hypochondroplasia is another allelic disorder that is caused by mutations in a difference region of <em>FGFR3 </em>that lead to milder clinical manifestations than achondroplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achondroplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achondroplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone changes secondary to progressive storage of complex carbohydrates (glycoproteins or glycolipids) slowly accumulating in the lysosomes and affecting cartilage and bones can occur in certain storage metabolic disorders, such as the mucopolysaccharidosis, mucolipidoses, or gangliosidoses.

These disorders include osteogenesis imperfecta, which is due to defects in collagen that affect matrix formation and hypophosphatasia, which affects the formation of hydroxyapatite needed for bone mineralization. (See <a href=\"#H2244055974\" class=\"local\">'Low bone density'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high bone density group of disorders are the result of bone-remodeling abnormalities. Patients with these disorders have an increased risk of fractures due to lack of bone flexibility. There are multiple forms and types of osteopetrosis, most of them caused by defects in osteoclastic activity. Examples include pyknodysostosis, infantile malignant osteopetrosis, and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, type II.
