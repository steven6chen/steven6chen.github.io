If you check your child's blood sugar levels often, you can treat low or high blood sugar before it becomes an emergency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What changes to make in your child's next insulin dose &ndash; Knowing your child's blood sugar level will help you choose his or her next insulin dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well-controlled your child's diabetes is &ndash; Keeping your child's blood sugar under control helps prevent health problems later in life.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059513\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I check my child's blood sugar level?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To check your child's blood sugar level, you use a device called a &quot;blood glucose meter.&quot; Your child's doctor or diabetes nurse will show you how to use yours. You will need to prick your child's fingertip to get a drop of blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57918 \">picture 1</a>). Try not to use the same finger each time.</p><p>You will put the drop of blood on a special glucose test strip that fits into the meter. After a few seconds, the meter will show your child's blood sugar level. Be sure to record your child's blood sugar levels and show the record to your child's doctor or nurse. He or she will use this information to make changes to your child's treatment plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059528\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should I check my child's blood sugar level?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child uses insulin, you need to check his or her blood sugar level 4 or more times each day. That will probably mean checking blood sugar levels before meals and snacks, and at bedtime. At least once a week, you might also need to check your child's blood sugar at night (between midnight and 4 AM). Plus, you might need to do overnight checks more often if your child's overnight insulin dose changes. Teenagers should check their blood sugar anytime they plan to drive.</p><p>Certain conditions can affect your child's blood sugar. You might need to check your child's blood sugar more often when he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is sick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travels, especially to another time zone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eats or exercises more or less than planned</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is under extra stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets vaccines &ndash; Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has symptoms of low or high blood sugar &ndash; These symptoms can be different, depending on the child and his or her age.</p><p/><p>Common symptoms of low blood sugar can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting cranky, tired, or not eating (especially in babies and toddlers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak, tired, nervous, or hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having nightmares or not sleeping well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p/><p>Common symptoms of high blood sugar can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating more than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling thirsty and drinking more than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or having no energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing fast or having a &quot;fruity-smelling&quot; breath &ndash; This can be a sign of a medical emergency called &quot;diabetic ketoacidosis.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059543\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if my child's blood sugar is low?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's doctor or nurse will tell you how to treat low blood sugar. It depends on the level, your child's age, symptoms, and the time of day.</p><p>In general, low blood sugar is treated with either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A quick source of sugar &ndash; Your child can eat or drink a quick source of sugar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71872 \">table 1</a>). Foods that have fat, such as chocolate or cheese, do not raise low blood sugar levels as quickly. You should carry a quick source of sugar for your child at all times. You should also leave quick sources of sugar at your child's school, and with babysitters and coaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A glucagon shot &ndash; Glucagon is a hormone that can quickly raise blood sugar levels. It comes in the form of a shot. If your child's doctor recommends that you carry a glucagon shot for your child, he or she will tell you when and how to use it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64557 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50427\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50427 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61722 \">picture 3</a>). Your child's doctor might also recommend that you leave a glucagon shot with a staff member at your child's school.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059558\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if my child's blood sugar is high?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's doctor or nurse will tell you how to treat high blood sugar. It depends on the blood sugar level, your child's age, and his or her symptoms. Episodes of high blood sugar are usually treated with insulin and extra fluids. To check how serious the high blood sugar is, you might need to test your child's urine. Your child's doctor or nurse will show you how to do this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059573\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child's blood sugar be checked at school?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You, your child's diabetes team, and the school should make a plan to manage your child's diabetes in school. This plan will list when your child's blood sugar should be checked and who will check it. Most children check their blood sugar before gym class, before lunch, and any time they do not feel well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059588\"><span class=\"h1\">When can my child check his or her own blood sugar?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends, in part, on your child's age. Have your young child help with blood sugar testing as much as possible so that he or she learns how to do it. Many children are able to check their own blood sugar by ages 8 to 11. But they usually still need help using the results to choose insulin doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059603\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=my-child-has-diabetes-how-will-we-manage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: My child has diabetes: How will we manage?
