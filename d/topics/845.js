It is most often triggered by foods, medications, and insect stings. There are many other possible triggers.</p><p>Anaphylaxis is an unpredictable condition. Many people who experience it have known allergies, and some people have had one or more allergic reactions previously. Others, who are not even aware that they have an allergy, can suddenly experience severe anaphylaxis. Even the first episode of anaphylaxis can be fatal.</p><p>The severity of an anaphylactic episode can be minimized by recognizing the symptoms early, having proper medication available for self-treatment, and seeking emergency medical care promptly. This topic reviews the symptoms and diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Treatment and prevention of anaphylaxis and how to use an epinephrine autoinjector are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-treatment-and-prevention-of-recurrences-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anaphylaxis treatment and prevention of recurrences (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLAXIS SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of anaphylaxis generally begin within minutes to one hour or so after exposure to a trigger.</p><p>The most common symptoms of anaphylaxis are hives (urticaria) and swelling of the skin (angioedema), which occur in 80 to 90 percent of reactions. Respiratory symptoms occur in about 70 percent of reactions and are especially common in people who also have asthma or another chronic respiratory disease. Extremely low blood pressure causing lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision, or loss of consciousness (passing out) occurs in up to about 70 percent of reactions.</p><p>Anaphylaxis can cause symptoms throughout the body:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin</strong> &ndash; Itching, flushing, hives (urticaria), swelling (angioedema)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eyes</strong> &ndash; Itching, tearing, redness, swelling of the skin around the eyes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nose and mouth</strong> &ndash; Sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, swelling of the tongue, metallic taste</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lungs and throat</strong> &ndash; Difficulty getting air in or out, repeated coughing, chest tightness, wheezing or other sounds of labored breathing, increased mucus production, throat swelling or itching, hoarseness, change in voice, sensation of choking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart and circulation</strong> &ndash; Dizziness; weakness; fainting; rapid, slow, or irregular heart rate; low blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Digestive system</strong> &ndash; Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nervous system</strong> &ndash; Anxiety, confusion, sense of impending doom</p><p/><p>A severe form of anaphylaxis causes sudden collapse without other obvious symptoms, such as hives or flushing. This form of anaphylaxis occurs most commonly after a person is given a medication into a vein or is stung by an insect.</p><p>Up to 20 percent of people with anaphylaxis have biphasic (two-phase) anaphylaxis, in which symptoms resolve and then recur without further exposure to the trigger. This can occur up to eight hours after the initial symptoms and sometimes longer.</p><p>Rarely, anaphylaxis can be protracted and last for hours or several days despite treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLAXIS TRIGGERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trigger for a person's anaphylaxis may be obvious or it may be difficult to identify.</p><p>Common anaphylaxis triggers can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods &ndash; In children, hen's eggs, cow's milk, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, wheat, and soy are the most common food triggers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In teens and adults, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and crustaceans (shellfish such as shrimp) are the most common triggers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Any food, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, and some spices and food additives, can cause anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications, such as antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) and analgesics (aspirin, ibuprofen).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venom from insects, including bees, yellow jackets, wasps, hornets, and fire ants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latex from natural rubber, found in some latex gloves, balloons, condoms, sports equipment, and medical supplies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergen immunotherapy (&quot;allergy shots&quot;), such as those given for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise, either by itself or after food ingestion (eg, wheat, celery, shrimp, or other food) or after medication ingestion (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less common triggers include exposure to airborne allergens (such as horse dander), human seminal fluid, cold water, or cold air.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, a specific trigger cannot be identified, even after a thorough evaluation. This condition is called idiopathic anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-treatment-and-prevention-of-recurrences-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anaphylaxis treatment and prevention of recurrences (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">IgE-mediated anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most people, anaphylaxis is caused by the presence of antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE antibodies are normally produced in the body for the purpose of fighting certain infections. In people with allergies, however, IgE is made in response to noninfectious substances, such as foods, medications, or insect venoms. This IgE then sticks to the outside of mast cells in body tissues and basophils, a type of white blood cell.</p><p>If a person with IgE antibodies to a specific allergen is exposed to that allergen again, these cells may suddenly become activated to release large amounts of inflammation-causing chemicals (including histamine and tryptase) into the bloodstream.</p><p>These chemicals cause the signs and symptoms typical of anaphylaxis (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anaphylaxis symptoms'</a> above). The allergic reaction can be so strong that it becomes life-threatening. For example, sudden severe swelling in the throat can lead to suffocation.</p><p>In some people with anaphylaxis, the reaction is caused by a process that does not involve allergens and IgE. Some people have too many mast cells or overly active mast cells. However, the symptoms and treatment are the same.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLAXIS RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people are more likely than others to experience anaphylaxis or to develop severe symptoms during anaphylaxis. For example, those who have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Previous severe anaphylactic reaction</strong>s &ndash; People who have had allergic reactions to a particular substance in the past are at increased risk of anaphylaxis. However, the severity of past allergic reactions does not reliably predict the severity of future reactions. People with mild reactions in the past may experience severe anaphylactic reactions in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asthma and other chronic lung diseases</strong> &ndash; People with asthma or other chronic lung disease are more likely to have more severe respiratory problems during anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other diseases</strong> &ndash; People with cardiovascular disease, for example, and coronary artery disease, are also at greater risk of severe anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLAXIS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based on symptoms that occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to a potential trigger, such as a food, medication, or insect sting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Is it anaphylaxis or another problem?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other health problems can cause symptoms that are similar to those of anaphylaxis. These include a severe asthma attack, a heart attack, a panic attack, or even food poisoning. After the acute anaphylactic episode, follow-up evaluation by an allergy specialist can help to clarify the diagnosis.</p><p>Tryptase is one of the natural chemicals released into the blood during an anaphylactic reaction. An increased amount of tryptase can sometimes be measured in a blood sample collected during the first three hours after anaphylaxis symptoms have begun (eg, after a medication has been taken or after an insect sting). However, tryptase levels are seldom elevated in food-induced anaphylaxis. A normal tryptase level does not exclude the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLAXIS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment and prevention of anaphylaxis are discussed separately.
