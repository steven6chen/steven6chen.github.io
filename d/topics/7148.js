The terms will be used interchangeably in this topic review. It should be noted that parent groups prefer the term stillbirth to the other terms. The ability to call a fetal loss a stillbirth is important to parents, in part because birth and death certificates are not generated after a miscarriage. In addition, parents report they receive less grief support after a miscarriage than after a stillbirth and less acknowledgement of the death of their child.</p><p>The incidence and etiology of fetal death, as well as strategies for prevention, will be reviewed here. Diagnosis and management of fetal demise, pathological evaluation of stillborns, and parental support and counseling are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-stillbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of stillbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal death and stillbirth: Maternal care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137462134\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terminology regarding fetal death and stillbirth is complicated and confusing for several reasons, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in definitions among countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences between medical definitions and regulatory criteria for reporting fetal deaths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of birth weight versus gestational age thresholds for reporting fetal death and interpretation when these values are discordant at the threshold distinguishing a fetal death from an abortus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpretation when there is a significant difference between the gestational age of fetal demise and the gestational age at delivery.

All fetal deaths &ge;500 g should be reported; when weight is not available, gestational age &ge;22 weeks is used as a criterion for reporting fetal death; if neither weight nor gestational is available, crown-heel length &ge;25 cm is used as a criterion for reporting fetal death and distinguishing a fetal death from an abortus.</p><p>For international comparison purposes, the WHO defines &quot;stillbirth&quot; as a baby born with no signs of life at &ge;28 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1367174959\"><span class=\"h2\">United States National Center for Health Statistics definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States National Center for Health Statistics defines fetal death as the spontaneous intrauterine death of a fetus at any time during pregnancy.

The reduction has been associated with improved access to and utilization of antenatal care and skilled birth attendants and attention to known maternal risks for stillbirth.</p><p>When comparing stillbirth rates globally, the rates of late stillbirths are used (those 28 weeks of gestation or later). Approximately 98 percent of these stillbirths occur in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rates of stillbirth in low socio-demographic index countries are substantially higher (about <span class=\"nowrap\">21/1000</span> live births) than in high socio-demographic index countries (about <span class=\"nowrap\">3/1000</span> live births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>At least half of the stillbirths in low-income countries occur during labor and birth, largely because of a lack of skilled birthing attendants and facilities for cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Antepartum stillbirths are often related to maternal infection or fetal growth restriction. Pregnancy-induced hypertension that is not identified and appropriately managed with induction of labor is another common cause of both fetal and maternal death in these countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2588404212\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States in 2013, the fetal mortality rate (a fetal demise &ge;20 weeks) was 5.96 per 1000 live births and fetal deaths, similar to the rate in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of the fetal deaths occurred between 20 and 27 weeks (primarily from 20 to 23 weeks of gestation) and the other 50 percent occurred at &ge;28 weeks. The number of fetal deaths was higher than the number of neonatal deaths and the number of infant deaths.</p><p>Sociodemographic factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black race &ndash; The fetal mortality rate was highest for non-Hispanic blacks (10.53 per 1000 live births and fetal deaths) and lowest for non-Hispanic whites (4.88 per 1000 live births and fetal deaths). While some of this increased risk can be attributed to access to, and quality of, medical care, other factors also contribute as black women experience a higher rate of stillbirth even when they have adequate access to prenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The increased risk in black women has been attributed to poorer preconception health, lower income, increased stress and racism, and a higher rate of infection. Genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors may be involved in the disparity as well as unknown factors. In addition, black women appear to be less likely than women of other races to be induced at term despite their higher rates of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, placental abruption, and term stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], which also may account for some of the disparity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger and older age &ndash; The fetal mortality rate was lowest for women ages 25 to 34 and higher for teenagers and women &ge;35 years of age.

The increased rate in multiples is due to complications specific to multiple gestations (such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome and twin reverse arterial perfusion sequence) as well as complications, such as fetal anomalies and growth restriction, which can occur in any pregnancy. Monochorionic placentation accounts for most of the increased risk.

Early gestational fetal mortality appears to be related to congenital anomalies, infections, intrauterine growth restriction, and underlying maternal medical conditions, whereas late gestational fetal mortality appears to be due to both maternal medical disorders and obstetrical disorders that generally evolve around the time of delivery, such as placental abruption and previa, cord prolapse, other labor and delivery complications, or unexplained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Unexplained stillbirth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An unexplained stillbirth is a fetal death that cannot be attributed to an identifiable fetal, placental, maternal, or obstetrical etiology due to lack of sufficient information or because the cause cannot be determined at the current level of diagnostic ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Variation in the proportion of stillbirths reported as unexplained (or unknown or unclassified) generally reflects (1) whether the stillbirth has been fully evaluated (ie, detailed evaluation of the mother, stillborn, umbilical cord, placenta, and events leading up to stillbirth), (2) whether the classification system allows risk factors to be included as causes, (3) subjective interpretation (speculation regarding mechanisms of death), and (4) the population (a cause of death is more likely to be found in populations with generally high disease burdens) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. As an example, the cause of stillbirth in a small for gestational age stillborn may be fetal growth restriction in some systems but considered unexplained in others if the underlying etiology of the growth restriction is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/20-22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22,25</a>]. In these systems, growth restriction may be considered a &ldquo;contributing factor&rdquo; rather than a cause.

Placental dysfunction is the presumed cause of both growth restriction and death. The estimated risk of stillbirth for growth-restricted fetuses is three to seven times that of the normally grown fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>].

Infection may lead to fetal demise as a result of severe systemic maternal illness (eg, pneumonia), placental dysfunction due to placental infection (eg, malaria), or fetal systemic illness (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, cytomegalovirus, Zika virus).</p><p>Most studies report infection is the cause of more preterm than term stillbirths. In developed countries, the majority of stillbirths related to infection occur in periviable fetuses following premature rupture of membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The usual mechanism is ascending infection from the lower genital tract. The rate of these losses has been relatively stable over the past 30 years. Viral pathogens are the most common source of hematogenous infection of the placenta, although bacteria, spirochetes, fungi, and protozoa can also cause transplacental infection. Almost any systemic infection that occurs during pregnancy can infect the placenta but usually does not lead to fetal death from infection. Malaria is a common cause of maternal infection leading to stillbirth in endemic areas. Parvovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, listeria, and herpes simplex virus are other well-established maternal infections that can lead to stillbirth. Parvovirus and CMV infection are relatively common and should be considered in stillbirths of unknown etiology after autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Histological evidence of both placental and fetal infection should be documented when citing infection as the cause of fetal death.

In an internet-based survey of 215 women with stillbirths after 28 gestational weeks, 49 percent reported decreased and weak fetal movement before confirmation of fetal death, 18 percent reported normal fetal movement, 16 percent described no fetal movement, 10 percent reported extremely vigorous fetal movement followed by no movement, and 6 percent interpreted contractions as fetal movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>Monitoring fetal movement has been suggested as a means of identifying fetuses in whom timely intervention will prevent death. Trials comparing <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> outcome in mixed-risk populations of women randomly assigned to follow a formal program of fetal movement counting or routine care have not yielded conclusive results.

As an example, perinatal audits have identified stillbirths resulting from deficiencies in intrapartum care, and quality improvement processes have been initiated to prevent recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/72,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,84</a>].

An audit by the Confidential Inquiry into Stillbirths and Infant Death of Northern Ireland found that failure to diagnose and appropriately manage fetal growth restriction was the most common error leading to stillbirth, followed by failure to recognize additional maternal medical risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. As discussed, identification and optimal management of these disorders lowers stillbirth rates.
