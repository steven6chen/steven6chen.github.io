Major advances in systemic chemotherapy have expanded the therapeutic options for these patients and improved median survival from less than 1 year to 30 months or longer for selected patients, and up to 20 percent of those treated with chemotherapy alone are still alive at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

With aggressive management integrating chemotherapy and surgery, long-term survival can be achieved in as many as 50 percent of cases.

Aggressive surgical resection for isolated adrenal metastases is described in only a few case reports or small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. In the largest series, of eight patients with apparently isolated adrenal metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) (all of whom underwent &quot;adjuvant&quot; chemotherapy), one remained alive and disease free 12 months after adrenalectomy, one was lost to follow-up, and six died of malignancy. The mean survival of the patients who died was 32 (range 12 to 60) months.</p><p>In contrast to the situation with isolated adrenal metastases, the development of adrenal metastases after liver resection for CRC liver metastases is associated with a poor prognosis, and adrenalectomy is probably not warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of ovarian metastases (synchronous or metachronous) in patients with CRC is 1 to 14 percent.

While it is generally acknowledged that ovarian metastases (particularly if synchronous and bilateral) represent a poor prognostic factor, complete resection may improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>Bulky ovarian metastases are often symptomatic and less responsive to systemic chemotherapy than are other sites of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Resection is associated with fairly low morbidity, and in some cases, may improve quality of life and prolong survival, even in the setting of widespread extra-ovarian metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12027710\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An isolated retroperitoneal nodal recurrence occurs in less than 2 percent of patients following a curative-intent colon cancer resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Salvage surgery had previously been avoided due to the poor prognosis of this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, this concept has been challenged. These series were largely collected over a time period when new chemotherapy regimens were evolving (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>). In more recent years, advances in chemotherapy and radiation therapy techniques have led to their use as potentially curative therapy for patients with apparently isolated paraaortic lymph node metastases (PALNMs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26-28</a>].</p><p>In this context, the role of resection was revisited in a systematic review of 18 retrospective, single-center case series of patients with apparently isolated PALNMs, published between 1998 and 2015; 5 series addressed management of synchronous PALNMs, 11 addressed patients with metachronous PALNMs, and 2 collectively addressed both populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A total of 370 patients were included; 145 had synchronous, and 225 had metachronous PALNMs. Compared to patients who did not undergo a paraaortic lymph node dissection, the median survival was longer in those who did (34 to 40 versus 3 to 14 months, respectively). For synchronous PALNMs, the five-year survival after metastasectomy ranged from 23 to 34 percent, while for metachronous PALNMs, it was 15 to 60 percent. There were no surgical mortalities, and the overall surgical morbidity rate ranged from 8 to 33 percent. The role of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not addressed. Others report that predictors of improved survival outcomes for patients with synchronous PALNMs include well-differentiated histology, a complete (R0) resection, and low-volume disease (ie, less than two PALNMs); among those with metachronous disease, a longer disease-free interval has been associated with improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. These results are difficult to interpret because these are retrospective studies with a small number of patients, and some of the studies in this review included patients with local recurrence in the retroperitoneum as well as patients with extraretroperitoneal disease. </p><p>In our view, resection is a reasonable option for patients with isolated retroperitoneal nodal metastases who have not progressed after systemic chemotherapy and who have no extraretroperitoneal metastatic disease, those whose retroperitoneal lymph node metastases are located below the left renal vein, and those with metachronous disease and very long disease-free intervals.</p><p>As is the case in patients with resected CRC hepatic or pulmonary metastases, it is unclear if the addition of chemotherapy improves the observed survival statistics. There are no data addressing the benefit of chemotherapy after resection of isolated retroperitoneal nodal disease.

In general, patients with a perforated tumor need surgery, while for those with bleeding or obstruction, decisions regarding surgery are dependent upon the clinical situation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer#H149209808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Complicated disease'</a>.)</p><p>Endoscopically deployed self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) may be used in the setting of obstruction, either as a permanent solution or as a strategy to allow for bowel decompression to reduce the risk that operation leads to colostomy.

Although with the newer chemotherapeutic regimens there may be a response in the primary tumor, this response may not be as robust in the primary site as it is in the liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As a result, for patients with an in situ primary tumor (whether symptomatic or not) who are receiving chemotherapy, it is imperative to evaluate the primary site periodically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Treatment recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the patient is not a surgical candidate because of comorbidities, high operative risk(s), decreased life expectancy, or refuses surgery, nonsurgical options can be considered.

In our view, if there are five or more simultaneous, potentially resectable hepatic metastases (unless all are located in one lobe), bilobar involvement, or if disease is borderline resectable due to location, initial chemotherapy followed by reassessment and delayed resection is probably a better strategy than upfront surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>There are considerable differences in the approach to synchronous potentially resectable metastatic disease. Some reports indicate a poor prognosis in such patients, at least in part attributable to the failure to resect clinically occult micrometastatic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In theory, delaying hepatic surgery by three to six months would permit the biological behavior of the metastatic disease to become evident, thus improving the selection of patients for whom hepatic metastasectomy might be curative.</p><p>Delayed resection does not seem to increase the risk of patients becoming unresectable due to growth of the initial metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], although if patients are untreated during this interval, it can increase the volume of resected liver, a significant predictor of postoperative complications. One potential solution is to perform percutaneous RFA during the interval between diagnosis and hepatic metastasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A more common approach is to administer chemotherapy during this period, which might also allow some patients with initially borderline resectable liver metastases to undergo successful later hepatic resection. If there is widespread disease progression during chemotherapy, resection will likely provide no specific benefit. If, on the other hand, the disease has responded or is stable, resection of both the primary tumor and the metastatic disease could be attempted in either a single or separate operations. Survival rates after resection of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases are better in patients who experience an objective response to chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

For most patients, simultaneous resection of the primary and metastatic disease is clearly preferable from the patient's perspective, and several surgical case series and meta-analyses have failed to confirm inferior survival or greater morbidity for patients who undergo a one-stage procedure compared with delayed (staged) hepatic resection, unless major hepatic resection (three or more segments) is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/32,35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,35-41</a>]. Factors that influence a decision on single operation versus a staged approach include the anticipated complexity of the colectomy, the size of the future liver remnant, the likelihood of major blood loss or prolonged hepatic ischemic times, and patient comorbidities. Because of the incidence of synchronous second primary colorectal cancers (CRCs; approximately 3 to 5 percent), complete colonoscopy prior to surgical resection should be undertaken, if feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosing second cancers and polyps'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Incurable metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision as to whether to resect the primary tumor is more complex for asymptomatic patients who have unresectable metastatic disease; in such patients, the risk to benefit ratio of resecting the primary tumor must be carefully considered. Resecting the primary is not without risk. For patients with metastatic CRC who undergo surgery, there is a 20 to 30 percent risk of postoperative morbidity, and a 1 to 6 percent risk of perioperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].

Total mesorectal excision improves rates of local control and recurrence-free survival compared with other surgical options. For patients with T3 or node-positive disease, the addition adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcomes over radical surgery alone. The combination of preoperative chemotherapy and RT in patients with locally advanced disease is association with fewer local recurrences and improved sphincter preservation rates, although a survival benefit compared with postoperative chemoradiotherapy has not been shown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-principles#H87590296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical principles&quot;, section on 'Total mesorectal excision'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Combined modality therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a>.) </p><p>There are no established guidelines for treatment of the rectal primary in patients with resectable, synchronous liver metastases, and in particular, the role of pelvic RT. However, the available data support the view that in such patients, the predominant pattern of disease recurrence is distant, not local, and that the addition of pelvic RT does not significantly reduce rates of local recurrence or improve disease-specific survival. Thus, while RT has a clear role in improving rates of sphincter preservation for low-lying tumors, and in patients for whom the likelihood of achieving a complete (R0) resection is in doubt based upon local disease extent, the omission of RT may be reasonable in patients without these issues who have a simultaneous diagnosis of resectable liver metastases.

Accumulating data suggest that long-term survival can be achieved in a small number of patients using aggressive surgical cytoreduction followed by heated (hyperthermic) intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). However, there remains insufficient evidence to conclude whether the survival advantage is due to treatment or to biologic features that allow these patients to undergo complete cytoreductive surgery. Furthermore, the quality of the cytoreductive surgery is dependent upon the skills and level of experience of the surgeon. The favorable results (particularly with regard to treatment-related toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]) achieved by international experts in the field may not be replicated in routine clinical practice. The independent contribution of HIPEC to the success of this approach has not been proven. Finally, a major unresolved issue is whether these results are better than could be achieved using modern oxaliplatin- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irinotecan-based systemic chemotherapy, with or without biologic agents.

Such a trial, USMCI <span class=\"nowrap\">8214/ACOSOG</span> Z6091, in which patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer (CRC) were randomized to standard systemic chemotherapy or to surgical cytoreduction with HIPEC followed by systemic chemotherapy, was closed for lack of accrual. Another trial, Prodige 7, in which patients with isolated intraperitoneal metastases from CRC are randomly assigned to cytoreductive surgery with or without HIPEC, is underway in France. An international list of centers with expertise in treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies is available online [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].</p><p>In addition to lymphatic and hematogenous spread, colon cancers may give rise to transcoelomic spread within the peritoneal cavity, resulting in peritoneal carcinomatosis. Peritoneal carcinomatosis carries a uniquely poor prognosis compared with metastatic disease in the visceral organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>].

This has led some to hypothesize that in some cases, peritoneal carcinomatosis may represent a first site of dissemination, and therefore, not necessarily indicative of generalized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. This appears to be rare overall. In a combined series of 2095 patients with metastatic CRC who were enrolled in two chemotherapy trials, 364 (17 percent) had peritoneal carcinomatosis, but only 44 (2.1 percent) had peritoneal carcinomatosis as the sole presentation of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>A similar paradigm is hypothesized for appendiceal cancer, which also has a propensity to spread intraperitoneally. Radical surgical cytoreduction and intraperitoneal chemotherapy has gained acceptance for the treatment of diffuse peritoneal adenomucinosis (pseudomyxoma peritonei) and selected patients with peritoneal dissemination of an appendiceal adenocarcinoma (mucinous peritoneal carcinomatosis).

In selected populations with <em>RAS</em> mutation-negative disease, up to 20 percent of patients remain alive at five years. However, patients with peritoneal metastatic CRC have a significantly shorter survival than do those with other isolated sites of metastatic disease, and outcomes may not be as favorable with systemic chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

If the metastases are potentially resectable, especially if they are located in one organ system (such as liver or lung), both the primary and the metastases should be managed aggressively. With integration of surgery and chemotherapy, long-term survival can be achieved in as many as 50 percent of cases. For patients with borderline resectable or initially unresectable but potentially resectable disease that is limited to the liver, downstaging with neoadjuvant chemotherapy may permit later successful resection. Even patients who are not candidates for a curative resection can benefit from surgical palliation for symptoms of obstruction and bleeding from the primary tumor. These patients must be managed by a multidisciplinary team. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3209671033\"><span class=\"h2\">Potentially resectable hepatic, lung, ovarian, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes and adrenal metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery provides a potentially curative option for selected patients with limited metastatic disease. Long-term survival can be achieved with metastasectomy in as many as 50 percent of cases, and an aggressive surgical approach to both the primary and the metastatic sites is warranted in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendations for surgical management of potentially resectable hepatic metastases (including a discussion as to integration of systemic chemotherapy into the surgical paradigm) and resection of pulmonary metastases are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Benefits, indications, preoperative evaluation, and techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with metastatic disease involving retroperitoneal lymph nodes, attempted resection is reasonable in very highly selected patients if the primary is controlled and the staging evaluation shows no evidence of disease at other sites, although recurrence rates are high. (See <a href=\"#H12027710\" class=\"local\">'Retroperitoneal nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the rare patient with a single adrenal metastasis, resection is a reasonable option if the primary is controlled and the staging evaluation shows no evidence of extra-adrenal disease involvement; however, this decision must be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Isolated adrenal metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection is also reasonable for patients with symptomatic bulky ovarian metastases, even in the presence of extra-ovarian metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of the primary tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of the primary site in patients who present with stage IV disease is controversial, and there are no data from prospective randomized studies to guide treatment. In general, the choice and sequence of treatment is guided by the presence or absence of symptoms from the primary tumor and whether or not the metastases are potentially resectable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a symptomatic primary tumor (bleeding, obstruction, perforation) and synchronous, potentially resectable, stage IV disease who are candidates for surgery, we suggest upfront resection of the primary tumor followed by chemotherapy and reevaluation for metastasectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic primary'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer#H149209808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Complicated disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic patients who are not candidates for resection of the primary tumor, other options include surgical bypass, diverting colostomy and mucous fistula or loop colostomy, placement of an intraluminal self-expanding metal stent, or for nonobstructing tumors, laser ablation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Methods for surgical palliation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer#H149212729\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with stage IV disease and who are not symptomatic from the primary tumor, an aggressive approach is warranted if the metastases are potentially resectable for cure. We suggest initial systemic chemotherapy to allow the natural history of disease progression to become manifest, followed by reevaluation and resection of both the primary tumor and metastases in the absence of widespread disease progression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with incurable metastatic disease who are receiving chemotherapy, we suggest not pursuing initial resection of the primary tumor in the absence of symptoms from the primary tumor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Incurable metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal carcinomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal management of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis without distant disease after a rigorous diagnostic workup is controversial. Although accumulating data suggest that long-term survival can be achieved in a small number of patients using aggressive surgical cytoreduction followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. However, there remains insufficient evidence to conclude whether the survival advantage is due to treatment or to biologic features that allow these patients to undergo complete cytoreductive surgery. Furthermore, the quality of the cytoreductive surgery is dependent upon the skills and level of experience of the surgeon. The favorable results (particularly with regard to treatment-related toxicity) achieved by international experts in the field may not be replicated in routine clinical practice. The independent contribution of HIPEC to the success of this approach has not been proven. Finally, a major unresolved issue is whether these results are better than could be achieved using modern oxaliplatin- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irinotecan-based systemic chemotherapy, with or without biologic agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: Completed clinical trials&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For all of these reasons, in our view (and that of the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2495\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]</a>), this approach should not be considered standard at present and should only be pursued in centers with demonstrated expertise, preferably in the context of a clinical trial.
