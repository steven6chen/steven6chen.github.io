This infection arises in two distinct ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endogenous form follows candidemia, with hematogenous seeding of the eye. Fungi usually first seed the highly vascular choroid, then infection typically progresses through the retina into the vitreous. The aqueous is sometimes involved as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exogenous form follows trauma, eye surgery, or progression of fungal keratitis (corneal infection). Fungi are directly inoculated into the aqueous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitreous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-exogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of exogenous endophthalmitis due to Candida species&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The management of endogenous endophthalmitis due to <em>Candida</em> species will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis are discussed separately. The management of exogenous endophthalmitis due to <em>Candida</em> species and endophthalmitis due to molds are also presented elsewhere. Bacterial endophthalmitis, <em>Fusarium </em>keratitis, and candidemia and other types of <em>Candida</em> infection are also discussed elsewhere.

The term &quot;endophthalmitis&quot; means infection within the eye and in general implies infection of the vitreous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aqueous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>). Endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis often presents first as chorioretinitis with minimal vitritis (vitreous inflammation) then later progresses to produce vitreous and sometimes aqueous infection. The term &quot;ocular candidiasis&quot; is used to describe this spectrum of infection, and some articles in the literature reserve the term &quot;<em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis&quot; only for cases in which the vitreous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aqueous are involved. However, the majority of publications include the entire spectrum, including chorioretinitis, in the term &quot;<em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis,&quot; so we will follow this convention. We will note the distinction between chorioretinitis alone and <em>Candida</em> infection that extends to involve the vitreous throughout this topic because the approach to therapy differs between these two conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No controlled trials of treatment regimens for endogenous <em>Candida </em>endophthalmitis have been performed. The evidence comes from case reports and small observational studies. In addition, studies of the treatment of candidemia have provided insights regarding the choice of therapy for endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to treatment must take into account the site and stage of infection, the pharmacology of the available antifungal agents, and existing clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Therapeutic approaches include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic antifungal agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravitreal antifungal agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical removal of the vitreous (vitrectomy)</p><p/><p>Our recommendations are generally in keeping with the 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the management of candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In general, patients who have only chorioretinitis can be treated with a systemic antifungal agent alone. For patients whose lesions threaten the macula or exhibit mild to moderate vitritis, many ophthalmologists will use intravitreal injections of antifungal agents in combination with systemic antifungal therapy in order to attain immediate high concentrations of the agent in the posterior compartment of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>). For patients who have moderate to heavy vitritis, vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antifungal agents along with systemic therapy is almost always necessary.</p><p>The overall prognosis for <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis has improved but only if the infection is diagnosed early and managed appropriately. Close follow-up by an ophthalmologist is required. (See <a href=\"#H148501932\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149720728\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis varies depending on whether only chorioretinitis is present, whether the macula is threatened, and the degree of vitritis. Patients with this condition should be evaluated and treated by both an ophthalmologist who has been trained to manage this condition (eg, a retina specialist) and an infectious diseases specialist. The systemic antifungal doses recommended below are intended for patients with normal renal function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2606842169\"><span class=\"h3\">Endogenous endophthalmitis without vitritis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with extramacular chorioretinitis without extension into the vitreous, we recommend the following treatment course:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For <em>Candida</em> species that are susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, systemic therapy with oral fluconazole (800 mg [12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> loading dose, then 400 to 800 mg [6 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> orally daily) OR voriconazole (400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> intravenously [IV] every 12 hours for two doses, then 300 mg [4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> IV or orally every 12 hours) can be used.

Although debate remains over the optimal target concentration, available data suggest a therapeutic range between 2 and 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. In patients with concentrations that are too high or too low, the serum concentration should be rechecked four to five days after adjusting the dose.

We do not generally recommend echinocandin therapy. If an echinocandin is considered in cases of chorioretinitis without vitritis (eg, in patients intolerant of other therapeutic options), it should only be used if frequent ophthalmic examinations can be performed and if improvement is documented on therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have <strong>macular involvement</strong> with or without extension into the vitreous, we suggest an intravitreal injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> (5 or 10 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (100 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline) in order to quickly achieve high local antifungal concentrations, in addition to systemic therapy, as noted above.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3566581302\"><span class=\"h3\">Endogenous endophthalmitis with vitritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis with moderate to heavy vitritis, vitrectomy should be performed in addition to intravitreal injection of antifungal agents. In those with light to moderate vitritis, vitrectomy may not be required, although intravitreal injection of antifungal agents may be indicated. An ophthalmologist should perform frequent dilated ophthalmic exams to follow the progression of the infection.

Treatment should continue until all active eye lesions have resolved as determined by serial dilated ophthalmic examinations. The length of treatment will depend on the rapidity of resolution of active eye lesions.

At this early stage of the infection, systemic therapy is probably adequate without intravitreal injection of antifungal agents. In patients who have endophthalmitis as a manifestation of disseminated candidiasis, it is essential that systemic therapy be given to treat other involved organ systems.

A study of eight eyes in seven patients who were receiving IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a> and who were scheduled for vitrectomy (six eyes) or enucleation (two eyes) reported mean micafungin concentrations of 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> in the plasma but, 30 to 90 minutes later, only 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> in aqueous samples and 0.10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> in vitreous samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Micafungin concentrations in other ocular structures were measured in one enucleated eye and showed reasonable levels in the choroid (5.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> 34 percent of the plasma level) but lower levels in the retina (1.20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> 7 percent of the plasma level) and vitreous (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> 0.88 percent of the plasma level). Currently, given their poor penetration into the vitreous, echinocandins <strong>cannot be recommended</strong> as treatment for <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis with vitritis, and their role in treating chorioretinitis alone is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that one might gain a sense of the success of echinocandin therapy for treating <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis by assessing the response to therapy of the few patients with ocular involvement who were included in the large randomized treatment trials of echinocandins for candidemia and invasive candidiasis. A total of 1028 patients received echinocandins in five randomized controlled treatment trials, and 21 were stated to have endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. Twelve patients (57 percent) were said to have had resolution of the eye infection. Unfortunately, in none of these trials were specific data reported with regards to the extent of ocular involvement (vitritis versus chorioretinitis) or use of intravitreal injections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitrectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278914238\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravitreal antifungal agents and vitrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few patients with vitritis have had a successful outcome documented with systemic antifungal therapy alone, but failure rates are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/1,11,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,14,18</a>]. In patients with endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis with moderate to heavy vitritis, vitrectomy should be performed, but, in those with light vitritis, vitrectomy may not be required. For severe vitritis, the best therapeutic strategy appears to be vitrectomy, intravitreal injection of amphotericin B (5 or 10 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (100 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline) and systemic antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/1,10,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11,14</a>]. Early vitrectomy may be important for a favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In at least one study of 12 patients with <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis, good outcomes were reported in the seven patients who underwent early vitrectomy (within one week), but poor visual outcomes were noted in four of five patients in whom vitrectomy was delayed or not performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The extent of vitreal involvement was not detailed in this report.</p><p>Vitrectomy entails the use of a vitrector, an instrument inserted into the vitreous that simultaneously cuts and aspirates much of the gel-like vitreous out of the eye. During this process, another cannula infuses a physiologic saline solution into the vitreous cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59512 \">figure 2</a>). Vitreous samples are sent for stains and culture.

High doses of intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> are toxic to the retina, but an intravitreal injection of 5 or 10 mcg (in 0.1 mL sterile water) appears to be safe and may be repeated several days later if evidence of intraocular infection persists on serial examinations. Patients have received cumulative intravitreal doses of 30 mcg amphotericin B deoxycholate without apparent retinal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Increasingly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> is used for intravitreal injection. The usual dosage of voriconazole for intravitreal injection is 100 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline, giving a final concentration in the vitreous of about 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>.</p><p>More than one intravitreal injection may be necessary.
