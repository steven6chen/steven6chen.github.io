In patients who develop significant rectal bleeding after total abdominal colectomy, completion proctectomy with an ultralow Hartmann&rsquo;s pouch or transanal suturing of the bleeding rectal ulcers can be performed to achieve hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>After the patient is stabilized, a completion proctectomy with reconstruction can be performed at a later time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a series of 50 patients who underwent urgent surgery for ulcerative colitis, a staged approach with a minimally invasive total abdominal colectomy followed by a minimally invasive completion proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis resulted in no mortality and only one anastomotic leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Most patients undergo a restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (RPC-IPAA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Patients with poor sphincter function, patients who are medically ill, young women, and those with indeterminate colitis may benefit from an alternate procedure.

RPC-IPAA allows patients with ulcerative colitis to live a near-normal life with a preserved body image and no need for a permanent stoma. (See <a href=\"#H28385380\" class=\"local\">'Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2849750\"><span class=\"h3\">Special patient groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RPC-IPAA is either <strong>not</strong> performed or performed <strong>selectively</strong> in these special patient groups.

Instead, they should undergo a total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy if they accept a permanent stoma, or a total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (TAC-IRA) if they do not desire a permanent stoma. (See <a href=\"#H28385637\" class=\"local\">'Total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28385590\" class=\"local\">'Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163785\"><span class=\"h4\">Patients who are medically ill</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are medically ill (eg, older patients, significant comorbid disease, concurrent rectal cancer), a proctocolectomy with end ileostomy is the best surgical option. Compared with an RPC-IPAA, a proctocolectomy with end ileostomy can be completed with shorter operative time and fewer potential complications (such as pouch failure or fecal incontinence). (See <a href=\"#H28385637\" class=\"local\">'Total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27957787\"><span class=\"h4\">Young women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open RPC-IPAA has been associated with infertility in females due to pelvic adhesion formation. Thus, for young women who desire to preserve fecundity, some authorities perform TAC-IRA initially and delay the completion proctectomy with ileal pouch reconstruction until the patient no longer desires future pregnancy. (see <a href=\"#H28385590\" class=\"local\">'Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis'</a> below). </p><p>Other authorities perform RPC-IPAA laparoscopically and place intraoperative adhesion barriers around the ovaries and fallopian tube in an attempt to reduce pelvic adhesion and preserve fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The distinction may be particularly difficult to make in patients with fulminant colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H12689106\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Indeterminate colitis resembles ulcerative colitis more than it does Crohn disease, although there may be an increased risk of perineal complications and pouch failure associated with indeterminate colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Thus, many surgeons treat patients with indeterminate colitis using the same procedures (eg, RPC-IPAA) as those used to treat ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/1,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29</a>]. When treated with RPC-IPAA, patients with indeterminate colitis achieved good functional results and low failure rates that were comparable to those achieved in patients with ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. An increased pouch failure rate was observed in patients whose diagnosis was later revised from indeterminate colitis to Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H28385380\" class=\"local\">'Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Other authorities prefer to treat indeterminate colitis patients who do not have significant rectal disease with a TAC-IRA procedure instead of RPC-IPAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. They fear that indeterminate colitis may progress to Crohn disease, which is associated with a high risk (about 50 percent) of pouch failure, requiring pouch excision and permanent ileostomy. (See <a href=\"#H28385590\" class=\"local\">'Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28385173\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four types of surgical procedures are commonly performed in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Although all four procedures include resection of the entire colon with or without the rectum, only two procedures include a gastrointestinal reconstruction. The other two procedures leave a permanent end ileostomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56142\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56142 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52597 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>All four procedures can be performed with an open or a minimally invasive technique (ie, laparoscopic, single-port [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>], or robotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]). Compared with open surgery, minimally invasive surgery offers short-term benefits (eg, less surgical site infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], less adhesion formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], better cosmesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and decreased length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]), but similar long-term outcomes (eg, recurrence rate, pouch function) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].
