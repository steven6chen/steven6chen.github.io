Of the thousands of spider species that exist around the world, only a handful causes problems in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are a variety of more common disorders that can mimic a spider bite, some of which represent a far greater threat to the patient if not recognized and treated appropriately.</p><p>Thus, accurate diagnosis is the initial goal of the clinician evaluating a patient with a lesion that might represent a spider bite. Discerning among the various conditions in the differential diagnosis of a spider bite requires familiarity with these disorders, as well as a basic understanding of the distribution and behavior of medically important spiders.</p><p>The spiders of medical importance, an overview of the clinical manifestations of their bites, and diagnosis and differential diagnosis of spider bites will be reviewed here. The assessment and management of spider bites caused by recluse and widow spiders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bites-of-recluse-spiders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bites of recluse spiders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites#H22850139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of widow spider bites&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-widow-spider-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of widow spider bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICALLY IMPORTANT SPIDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spiders are arachnids (a group of arthropods), which have four pairs of legs, similar to scorpions, mites, and ticks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50381\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50381 \">figure 1</a>). They use sharp fangs at the end of their chelicerae to bite prey (typically insects, other arthropods, or small vertebrates) and inject venom.</p><p>Most spiders pose no threat to humans. The venom of most spiders has little or no effect on mammalian tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, only a few species have cheliceral muscles powerful enough to penetrate human skin, and most of these spiders bite humans only in rare and extreme circumstances (eg, as they are being fatally crushed between skin and some object).</p><p>The spiders most likely to inflict medically significant bites in humans include widow and false black widow spiders, recluse spiders, Australian funnel web spiders, and Phoneutria spiders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Each of these spiders is described briefly below, and their appearance and geographical distribution are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The arachnology of recluse and widow spiders is discussed in detail separately.

Although less toxic than the black widows, the brown widow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79607\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79607 \">picture 2</a>) is causing increased interest because of its novelty as a nonnative spider quickly spreading throughout the Southern US. Widow bites cause unremarkable local lesions that are sometimes accompanied by a characteristic systemic reaction with prominent, proximally-spreading pain and localized diaphoresis surrounding the site of the bite. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites#H22850139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of widow spider bites&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">False black widow spiders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steatoda or false black widow spiders (found worldwide) are less often implicated in human bites, and cause less severe symptoms that those of widows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73853 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Recluse spiders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loxosceles or recluse spiders are found predominantly in North and South America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70229\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70229 \">picture 4</a>). Their bites are notorious for becoming necrotic, although this happens in a minority of cases. Systemic reactions to bites are usually mild, and consist of nonspecific systemic signs and symptoms. Rarely, patients may develop systemic manifestations including constitutional symptoms and hematologic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bites-of-recluse-spiders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bites of recluse spiders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Australian funnel web spiders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Australian funnel web spiders are found in limited areas of eastern coastal Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Their bites can cause dramatic systemic reactions that mimic organophosphate poisoning and include salivation, diaphoresis, muscle spasms, tachycardia, hypertension, muscle fasciculations (tongue fasciculations are typical), paresthesias, catecholamine-induced myocarditis, and pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>First aid for a suspected funnel web spider envenomation consists of pressure immobilization applied as for elapid snake bites without local tissue necrosis and rapid transport to definitive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of coral snakebites&quot;, section on 'Pressure immobilization'</a>.)</p><p>Antivenom, derived from rabbit IgG, is typically given to patients with severe signs of envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Dosing consists of two to four vials for severe envenomation and two vials for signs of systemic envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one case series of eight patients, two vials of antivenom was sufficient to bind all free venom in serum samples from patients with moderate to severe envenomation, although cardiac toxicity in severe cases was not reversed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Nevertheless, antivenom administration should only occur in facilities equipped to rapidly manage anaphylaxis and when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, antihistamine, and corticosteroid medications are immediately available and ready to administer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78744 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">South American Phoneutria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Phoneutria</em> or armed spiders are large spiders found predominantly in South America, especially urban areas of Brazil. The bites of these spiders typically cause mild envenomation consisting of pain at the site, redness, piloerection, and primary (localized) diaphoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. However, systemic reactions, consisting of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, visual disturbances and autonomic effects (ie, tachycardia, hypertension, generalized diaphoresis, salivation, and, especially in young boys, priapism) may occur in up to 10 percent of bites with a higher frequency of systemic findings in young children. Fatalities from pulmonary edema and shock can occur but are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Pain control is the primary treatment for mild envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Polyvalent Fab fragment antivenom is available for patients with systemic envenomation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2263765\"><span class=\"h2\">Yellow sac spiders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yellow sac spiders (<em>Cheiracanthium spp.</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95326\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95326 \">picture 5</a>) are common indoor resident spiders in North America, but can occupy indoor and outdoor niches and are distributed worldwide.&nbsp;In human environments, they can be found in garden sheds, garages, house foundations, window sills, between folds of curtains, and baseboards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].&nbsp;While reputed in prior literature to be a cause of skin necrosis, more recent case series have not identified skin necrosis in association with documented yellow sac spider bites.&nbsp;They can, however, cause painful bites similar to bee stings (unlike the painless bites of <em>Loxosceles</em> and <em>Latrodectus</em>).&nbsp;This species is very aggressive and is known to bite suddenly while crawling over its victims. Because the bite is painful, it is often rapidly recognized with recovery of the spider. </p><p>A case series of 20 documented <em>Cheiracanthium</em> spider bites in the United States and Australia reported pain or discomfort in all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Redness at the bite site was also common. Other local effects included swelling and pruritus. The median duration of pain was approximately two hours but pain lasted 2 days in one patient. Systemic effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, or headache) occurred in three patients.&nbsp;</p><p>Treatment consists of washing of the bite site, pain control with oral analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>), and, when present, symptomatic treatment of pruritus with an antihistamine. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spider bite usually presents acutely as a solitary papule, pustule, or wheal. Systemic symptoms can accompany some envenomations, particularly those of widow spiders, funnel web spiders, and less often, recluse spiders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Allergic reactions typically result from contact with spiders (rather than bites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photographs of verified spider bites are rare in the medical literature, although dramatic images of necrotic lesions attributed to spider bites are commonplace in both medical journals and on the Internet. In reality, the majority of spider bites result in unremarkable wheals, papules, or pustules. Local redness with a tender nodule at the site of the bite appears within minutes. The lesions are similar to those induced by a bee sting. In some cases, the markings of the fangs (one or two small puncture marks) are visible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52977\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52977 \">picture 6</a>) although this is not always a diagnostic feature. Some bites also itch or burn.</p><p>Spider bites may or may not be painful, and some go unnoticed. Discomfort can develop gradually over the ensuing hours after a bite, and can range from a slight prickly sensation to severe pain. The variability among bites and patients limits the clinical utility of pain in implicating a specific type of spider.</p><p>Most local reactions to spider bites resolve spontaneously in approximately 7 to 10 days. They occasionally become secondarily infected with skin-derived bacteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Necrotizing local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recluse (Loxosceles) spiders inflict bites that may become necrotic, although this is an uncommon complication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174 \">picture 7</a>). Other types of spiders have been implicated in causing necrotic bites, but this is based largely upon circumstantial evidence. The management of necrotic recluse spider bites is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bites-of-recluse-spiders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bites of recluse spiders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic symptoms are reported in a minority of patients, and occur when venom enters the circulation in sufficient amounts.</p><p>The bites of certain spiders are known for distinct and potentially severe systemic reactions, including bites of the widow, Australian funnel web, Loxosceles and Phoneutria spiders.

These nonaggressive spiders rarely bite. When threatened, they dislodge small (about 1 mm long) barbed hairs at the posterior of their abdomens and launch them at their attacker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108978 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108907\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108907 \">picture 10</a>). These urticating hairs, as well as airborne material from crushed tarantulas, may cause irritation if they come in contact with skin, eyes, or mucous membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/1,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-13</a>]. In addition, airborne material from tarantulas can cause foreign body reactions in the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Allergic reactions to spiders are rare and have been reported mostly in humans who have frequent contact with urticating hairs from large spiders, including tarantulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/10-13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13,15</a>].

However, the diagnosis of a spider bite can be considered definitive <strong>only</strong> if the criteria below are fulfilled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A spider was observed inflicting the bite.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spider was recovered, collected, and properly identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin lesion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic finding typically associated with the type of spider bite are present.</p><p/><p>If these criteria are not met, then other conditions such as vasculitis, infection, vascular problems, or other relevant disorders must be ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Unfortunately, the criteria above are rarely met, even in published medical reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This has resulted in a body of literature and considerable media attention falsely attributing various lesions and symptoms to spider bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The extent of this problem was illustrated in a review of 600 cases of suspected spider bites, which found that 80 percent of presumed bites could be more reasonably attributed to other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These other causes included bites of different arthropods such as ants, fleas, bedbugs, ticks, mites, mosquitoes, and biting flies, as well as erysipelas, cellulitis, ecthyma, vasculitis, pyoderma, ophthalmic zoster, urticaria, angioedema, and burns. Similarly, in an observational study of 182 patients who came to an emergency department with a chief complaint of a spider bite, 84 percent were diagnosed with a skin or soft tissue infection; only seven patients were confirmed by a clinician to have a spider bite, and of these, only three had the spider identified, none by an arachnologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patient reports of spider bites are unreliable. The bite history is often speculative and retrospective and a spider was never visualized, either inflicting the bite or even present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Even when a bite is witnessed by the patient, the &quot;spider&quot; is commonly found to be some other arthropod [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of a spider bite is thus highly suspect unless the patient actually observed a spider inflicting the bite and can retrieve it for identification. In the absence of this history and supporting evidence, another explanation should be sought. </p><p>The setting in which the patient sustained the alleged bite should be carefully reviewed to see if it is consistent with the known habitat and behavior of the toxic spiders that live in the area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites#H19715450\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of widow spider bites&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bites-of-recluse-spiders#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bites of recluse spiders&quot;, section on 'Habitat'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bites-of-recluse-spiders#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bites of recluse spiders&quot;, section on 'Clinical history'</a>.)</p><p>People may worry about the possibility that a toxic spider was transported into a non-indigenous area on fruit or other produce. However, it is rare for spiders to survive intact through the many steps involved in produce transportation, and then end up in a situation in which they would bite. The risk may be more significant for a person working in food transport and handling, but it is minimal in the general community. The most common event occurring after the discovery of a large spider in transported produce is misidentification of a harmless tropic spider as that of a potentially dangerous Phoneutria spider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Clinical clues that essentially EXCLUDE the diagnosis of spider bite include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple lesions or more than one lesion on widely-separated parts of the body suggest another etiology.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bites-of-recluse-spiders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bites of recluse spiders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites#H22850188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of widow spider bites&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>As discussed previously, many other conditions are more common than spider bites and pose a more immediate threat to the patient's health if not accurately diagnosed. A patient who did not clearly witness a spider inflicting the bite should be presumed to have some other disorder, and the presence of multiple lesions essentially excludes the diagnosis of spider bite. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinician can usually determine whether a spider bite is possible based upon a careful history of the patient's recent activities, details of the onset and evolution of the lesion, and knowledge of biting spiders found in the area. Despite this, it is not uncommon for patients to present with nondescript lesions, suggest that it might be a spider bite because of some circumstantial detail, and have that history accepted without further questioning.</p><p>A spider bite may present as a papule, pustule, wheal, plaque (possibly ecchymotic), or ulcer. The most common disorders that are mistaken for local reactions to spider bites include infections and the bites of other insects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Papules and pustules should be carefully unroofed and cultured to identify infectious causes. Common infections that could be mistaken for spider bites include staphylococcus and streptococcal infections, the skin lesion of early Lyme disease, and atypical presentations of herpes zoster or herpes simplex.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) skin infections can begin with singular papules or pustules that may evolve to necrotic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. CA-MRSA is far more prevalent than spider bites. Infections occur both sporadically and as institutional epidemics in nursing homes, prisons, military barracks, and athletic facilities. Risk factors and epidemiology of CA-MRSA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-in-adults-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Epidemiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-clinical-spectrum#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in children: Epidemiology and clinical spectrum&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema migrans, the target-like skin lesion of early Lyme disease, may be mistaken for a spider bite (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62480 \">picture 11</a>). Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) is a similar infection with similar skin findings, which occurs in the southern United States (below Maryland).

Acute onset is associated with vesicles, vesicopustules, severe edema, erythema, or pain. Tzanck staining for multinucleated giant cells and viral culture are useful to confirm the diagnosis.

Spiders are less likely to do so than many others. With the exception of tick-borne illnesses and allergic reactions, the exact insect inflicting the bite is of little clinical importance and local care suffices.</p><p>Scorpion stings are more common than spider envenomations worldwide, and most stings have been reported in Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia, and Central and South America. In the United States, scorpion stings are most common in Arizona and nearby areas of the Southwest. Stings are instantaneously painful, and patients usually capture or at least clearly witness the offender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

Most spiders bite humans only as a final defense when being crushed between skin and another object. Thus, most lesions attributed to spider bites are caused by some other etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spiders that can cause medically significant bites include widow and false widow spiders (worldwide), recluse spiders (mostly North and South America), Australian funnel web spiders (eastern coastal Australia), and Phoneutria spiders (Brazil) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Medically important spiders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute spider bites most commonly result in a solitary papule, pustule, or wheal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174 \">picture 7</a>). Systemic symptoms can accompany envenomations of widow, funnel web, and Phoneutria spiders, and less often, those of recluse spiders. The bites of recluse spiders can become necrotic, although most bites do not necrose. Skin, eye, or mucous membrane irritation after can occur after contact with urticating hairs from large spiders such as tarantulas or wolf spiders. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Types of reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bites-of-recluse-spiders#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bites of recluse spiders&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations of bites'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites#H22850139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of widow spider bites&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-widow-spider-bites#H4466631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of widow spider bites&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should know which of the biting spiders (if any) are found in the areas in which they practice, and have a basic understanding of the entomology of those species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Influence of geographic location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The working diagnosis of a spider bite is based upon suggestive history and clinical presentation. However, definitive identification of a spider bite requires all of the following: a spider was observed inflicting the bite, the spider was recovered, collected, and properly identified by an expert entomologist, there is a skin lesion or systemic findings associated with the spider bite, and other medical conditions that may cause similar clinical manifestations have been ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of cases, another etiology is responsible for the lesion, other than a spider bite. The differential diagnosis includes infections, bites and stings of other arthropods, and several other more common skin conditions.
