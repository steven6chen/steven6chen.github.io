(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-principles#H87588997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical principles&quot;, section on 'Selecting a surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In addition to fecal incontinence, another absolute contraindication to IPAA is a surgical emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restorative-proctocolectomy-with-ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis-laparoscopic-approach/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the emergency setting, the majority of surgeons would perform a total abdominal colectomy with an end Brooke ileostomy and preservation of the anorectum followed by an IPAA at a later date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restorative-proctocolectomy-with-ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis-laparoscopic-approach/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Massive bleeding from the rectal stump identified intraoperatively is seldom an indication for an immediate total proctocolectomy, but more often to a near total proctocolectomy with a very short rectal stump. The issue with such an approach is that retrieving the rectal stump to complete the proctectomy and to construct the anastomosis becomes very difficult at the second operation.</p><p>In addition to meeting criteria for RPC-IPAA, patients must also fulfill criteria to undergo a laparoscopic approach, including ability to tolerate a pneumoperitoneum and having few previous <span class=\"nowrap\">intra-abdominal/pelvic</span> operations and few adhesions. As experience with laparoscopic RPC-IPAA increases, previous abdominal operations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adhesions become a relative contraindication. Laparoscopy can be performed electively as well as in the emergent setting of acute fulminant colitis. A review of 207 consecutive patients undergoing a restorative proctectomy (RP) and restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) found that patients managed by the laparoscopic approach (n = 76) had a shorter median duration of hospital stay compared with patients managed by laparotomy (median stay six versus eight days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restorative-proctocolectomy-with-ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis-laparoscopic-approach/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients undergoing a laparoscopic RPC also had similar rates of total complications (51 versus 61 percent), anastomotic leaks, 30-day readmission, reoperation, and stoma closure. The conversion from a laparoscopic approach to a laparotomy was 9 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7533295\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL OPTIONS TO LAPAROSCOPIC RPC-IPAA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proctocolectomy procedures are performed using open or laparoscopic approaches. With increasing experience with laparoscopic colorectal surgery, there are no absolute contraindications to laparoscopy and the decision is based upon surgeon judgment, skills, and experience. Minimally invasive techniques are central to fast-track protocols with advantages of a decrease in inflammatory mediators, improved pulmonary function with oncologic outcomes comparable to the open technique, faster return of bowel function, and reduced hospital length of stay (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-recovery-after-colorectal-surgery#H173017457\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery&quot;, section on 'Laparosopic surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are not candidates for laparoscopy may be candidates for the open approach to the RPC-IPAA procedure. For patients who are not candidates, or who prefer not to undergo RPC-IPAA, a total proctocolectomy (TPC) with an end ileostomy is the alternative surgical option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restorative-proctocolectomy-with-ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis-laparoscopic-approach/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Although obesity and previous abdominal operations often make laparoscopic colorectal procedures challenging, they are not considered absolute contraindications to laparoscopy. </p><p>The principles of an open resection are the same as those for a laparoscopic resection.

This approach is indicated in clinical settings such as pregnancy and acute fulminant colitis requiring emergent operative management, extreme obesity, a narrow pelvis, and uncertainty of diagnosis, such as ulcerative colitis versus Crohn's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restorative-proctocolectomy-with-ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis-laparoscopic-approach/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Long-term functional results and quality of life are best illustrated by a 30-year retrospective study of patients who underwent RPC-IPAA for chronic ulcerative colitis. At 30 years, 93 percent of patients maintained a functional pouch, although stool frequencies increased slightly (5.7 to 6.2 during day; 1.5 to 2.1 at night) compared with at one year.

The overall average number of daily bowel movements was similar between laparoscopic and open groups. There was a trend toward improved stool consistency with mostly pasty bowel movements in the laparoscopic group. There were no significant differences in fecal continence between the groups. In the laparoscopic group, only 20.8, compared with 21.9, percent of patients in the open group reported some degree of incontinence. Fewer patients in the laparoscopic group used pads during the daytime and nighttime. The quality of life was similar between the groups.

Accordingly, body image scores were also higher in the laparoscopic-assisted group than in the open group, although this difference was not statistically significant.
