However, fertility declines with advancing age. Thus, many women in more advanced age groups are presenting for fertility evaluation and treatment.</p><p>This topic will discuss the background, evaluation, and treatment of infertility in women of advancing reproductive age (ARA). While the phrase &quot;advanced maternal age,&quot; or AMA, has traditionally been used to describe these women, we prefer the broader phrase &quot;advancing reproductive age&quot; because it applies to all aspects of reproductive biology and not just maternity.

In the United States, the mean age of women having their first child increased from 21.4 years in 1970 to 26.3 in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. One contributor to the rising mean age of first pregnancy is that many more first pregnancies are occurring in ARA women. During the period 2000 to 2014, the proportion of first births to women aged 30 to 34 years rose 28 percent (from 16.5 to 21.1 percent), and first births to women aged 35 years and over rose 23 percent (from 7.4 to 9.1 percent). These trends have been attributed to a number of societal changes such as increased education for women, higher employment rates, and better access to reliable birth control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3842717359\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY OF FERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fertility declines as a woman matures, with gradual decline beginning at 32 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although exceptions exist, there are few spontaneous conceptions that result in live births in women over 43 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This decline in fertility is likely multifactorial. Women are born with a fixed number of oocytes, which declines with age. The quality of oocytes also declines with age because meiotic errors occur more frequently with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. During the menstrual cycle, the process to select a dominant follicle for ovulation does not exclude genetically abnormal oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, as women mature, the number of chromosomally anomalous oocytes ovulated increases, which results in lower fertility and increased risk of miscarriage. In addition to the endogenous accumulation of genetic errors in the oocyte pool over time, other factors such as smoking, other environmental exposures, and certain medical and surgical treatments can compromise oocyte quality, ovarian reserve, and chance for a healthy outcome for pregnancy as women age.</p><p>This decline in both oocyte quantity and quality is manifested by a prolongation in the average time for achieving conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fecundability (ie, the probability of achieving a pregnancy in one menstrual cycle) begins to decline significantly in the early 30s with a more rapid decline a few years later (about age 37) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Several lines of evidence from both natural and assisted cycles support this finding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In historical cohorts in whom deliberate fertility control was rare and conception did not generally precede marriage, the rate of involuntary childlessness in women who married at age 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and 40 to 44 was 6, 9, 15, 30, and 64 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In other similar groups, the average age of last birth ranged from 40.9 to 45.7 years and 87 to 99 percent of women were infertile at age 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large well-designed study reported the probability of clinical pregnancy following intercourse on the most fertile cycle day in women of average fertility age 19 to 26 years, 27 to 34 years, and 35 to 39 years was approximately 50, 40, and 30 percent, respectively, if the male partner was the same age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A classic study of women undergoing donor insemination for male factor infertility (azoospermia) found women &ge;35 years of age had lower conception rates and required more cycles to achieve conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Women who were 26 to 30 years of age had similar conception rates to women 25 years of age or younger, while women 31 to 35 had an intermediate success rate. Conception rates for women under age 31 years, age 31 to 35 years, and over age 35 years were 74, 62, and 54 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Population-based data on outcome of in vitro fertilization using fresh non-donor eggs showed the success rate for women in their late 30s and early 40s was significantly lower than for women under 37 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The live birth rates for women &lt;35 years of age, age 35 to 37 years, age 38 to 40 years, age 41 to 42 years, age 43 to 44 years, and &gt;44 years were approximately 42, 32, 22, 12, 5, and 1 percent per cycle, respectively. In contrast, in women who used eggs obtained from healthy, young donors, 51 percent of fresh transfers resulted in a live birth, regardless of the age of the recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040787531\"><span class=\"h1\">DIMINISHED OVARIAN RESERVE</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Definition</strong> &ndash; Ovarian reserve describes the functional capability of the ovary and includes the number and quality of a woman's remaining oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Generally, diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) refers to a woman of reproductive age who has regular menses but reduced fecundity or decreased response to ovarian stimulation compared with age-matched women. However, there is no universally agreed upon criteria for diagnosing DOR. Tests can include assessment of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), Inhibin B, and a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate challenge test (CCCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The National Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System (NASS) also includes reduced ovarian volume related to congenital, medical, surgical or other causes and age greater than 40 years in its definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limitations</strong> &ndash; Because of the heterogeneity of definitions, it is difficult to provide a prognosis to those who are suspected to have DOR. While these markers may predict decreased ovarian response to ovarian stimulation, they do not predict conception or live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a prospective cohort study of women age 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for three months or less, the predicted probability of conception after either 6 or 12 cycles of spontaneous attempts was similar among women with normal and abnormal levels of AMH and FSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This study, however, does not address conception or birth rates for women with a known diagnosis of infertility. For women in this age group with known infertility who are considering in vitro fertilization (IVF), these tests do have some prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A discussion of the specific tests used to assess ovarian reserve is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Our approach</strong> &ndash; In our practice, we define diminished ovarian reserve similarly to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology consensus statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. To be diagnosed with poor ovarian response, two of the three must be present: (1) Advanced age (greater than or equal to 40 years old) or any other risk factor, (2) Previous poor response to ovarian stimulation (three or fewer oocytes with IVF), and (3) Any abnormal ovarian reserve test (AFC &lt;5 or AMH &lt;1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. Because the definition includes results from ovarian stimulation, patients who are over 40 years with abnormal ovarian reserve testing are also considered poor responders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impact of age</strong> &ndash; Even with very sensitive laboratory testing, age is one of the most reliable single prognostic factors for both spontaneous conception and for successful fertility treatments. As an example, even in the setting of normal laboratory testing, women who are over the age of 40 can struggle to conceive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deliver a healthy pregnancy. Conversely, younger women who have abnormal testing may have a limited amount of time to complete reproduction but may have better outcomes depending on the cause of the low ovarian reserve. For example, a women who has had multiple cystectomies for dermoids may have a better prognosis than a woman with low ovarian reserve of a genetic etiology (eg, Turner's syndrome). Thus, women of any age who have abnormal ovarian reserve testing should be expeditious in building their family.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4257136907\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent with the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, we advise initiating an infertility evaluation after six months of attempting conception for women 35 years and older and immediate consultation for those who are attempting at 40 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Additionally, risk factors such as prior pelvic surgery (particularly involving the ovaries or ovarian vasculature), endometriosis, chemotherapy, pelvic infections, and known male factor infertility should prompt consideration of an earlier evaluation. Thus we consider any woman with risk factors for infertility as given above as needing a timely evaluation. The general evaluation of female infertility is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the general infertility evaluation, women age 40 and above usually undergo a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate challenge test (CCCT). While the utility of the CCCT compared with day 3 measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has been debated, CCCT is still widely used and does provide some meaningful data, particularly if abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because of variability of assays and standards across institutions, it is impossible to give absolute values for abnormal testing. In general, however, a day 3 or day 10 FSH of &gt;15 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> (as part of the CCCT) or a day 3 estradiol of &gt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> is viewed as having a poor prognosis in our practice. Careful counseling is provided about low probability of live birth using autologous oocytes. This information may be helpful to women who are considering expensive, time-consuming, and invasive treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4250971780\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1651631762\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selecting a treatment strategy can be a complex process. In addition to giving thought to test results, there are social and financial considerations. Issues that need to be discussed prior to outlining a treatment plan include the size of family the patient envisions, religious and ethical views on reproduction interventions, and the patient's attitudes about genetic testing of embryos, selective reduction, termination of pregnancy, and the potential for having a child with a chromosomal anomaly such as Down syndrome. As with many treatments that are heavily dependent on the patient's values, there is often more than one option and the choice is ultimately determined by the patient.</p><p>In our practice, if there are no medical, financial, or social limitations, we suggest a more aggressive approach with women age 35 years and older who have undergone an infertility evaluation and offer them treatment as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112265\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112265 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who do not have adequate ovarian reserve, and thus a poor prognosis for live birth from their own oocytes, we counsel regarding using donor oocytes or alternate family planning options, such as adoption or surrogacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3906698315\" class=\"local\">'Donor oocytes'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with adequate ovarian reserve but additional abnormal testing on fertility evaluation (eg male factor, distal or bilateral tubal factor), we recommend they proceed directly with in vitro fertilization (IVF) as IVF has demonstrated efficacy for these women with a fecundability rate higher than that of natural conception or ovulation induction (OI) with intrauterine insemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/6,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3778578491\" class=\"local\">'In vitro fertilization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with adequate ovarian reserve, otherwise normal fertility evaluation, and no restrictions to IVF, we suggest they proceed with IVF because of the higher pregnancy rates in fewer treatment cycles for IVF compared with initial treatment with OI and intrauterine insemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3778578491\" class=\"local\">'In vitro fertilization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who decline IVF but have adequate ovarian reserve and otherwise normal fertility evaluation, we offer OI and intrauterine insemination (IUI). For women of advanced reproductive age, the author prefers OI with gonadotropins because gonadotropin treatment results in a higher probability of live birth compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate (CC) OI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, gonadotropin treatment also results in more multiple gestations, including triplet and higher gestations. For this reason, other experts prefer CC as the first OI agent, and proceed with gonadotropin treatment only if <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> is not successful. This discrepancy reflects the challenge of balancing the desire for live birth with the risk of multiple gestations. Thus, careful counseling is required for women considering OI. We do not use aromatase inhibitors because they have a lower pregnancy rate than either gonadotropin or CC treatment, although some experts will use aromatase inhibitors in women who are unable to proceed with IVF and have not conceived with gonadotropins or CC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. We typically treat with up to three cycles of <span class=\"nowrap\">OI/IUI</span> and again offer IVF if the woman has not conceived. (See <a href=\"#H1456683293\" class=\"local\">'Ovulation induction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women &ge;35 years of age, we typically proceed with assisted reproductive techniques (ART) but also offer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> if ART is not possible (eg, financial restraints). Advancing directly to ART has been shown to shorten the time to pregnancy (median time to pregnancy 8 and 11 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, ART offers the option of freezing excess embryos for future use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, these women were offered gonadotropin OI and IUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. The use of <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI</span> has fallen out of favor because of the increased rate of multiple gestations, including a rate of twin pregnancies of up to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. During ART, the number of embryos transferred into the uterus is controlled by the clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For couples who do not desire or are unable to proceed with ART, we offer three to five cycles of CC or an aromatase inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, as clinically indicated, with IUI. The use of aromatase inhibitors in infertility therapy is discussed separately.

As women mature, this continues to decline until the 44<sup>th</sup> birthday, when the fecundability is negligible. Thus expectant management is most appropriate for those who do not want to or cannot pursue more aggressive approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1456683293\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovulation induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that the pool of healthy oocytes is reduced in women with advancing age, one approach to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy is OI. The principal behind OI in women who are already ovulatory is to medically rescue potentially healthy oocytes that are lost during the ovulatory process to atresia. Although the fraction of chromosomally abnormal oocytes increases with age, OI increases the number of oocytes that are matured and ovulated each month, thus increasing the probability that one of the oocytes released will be healthy and available for fertilization. Agents used for OI include CC, aromatase inhibitors, and gonadotropins (primarily follicle-stimulating hormone). Aromatase inhibitors have a lower pregnancy rate in ovulatory women than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate or gonadotropins, and for this reason, we do not use these agents in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risks associated with OI include formation of ovarian cysts that can result in hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> torsion and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), although OHSS is relatively rare in women with limited ovarian reserve. Pregnancy-related risks include ectopic pregnancy and multifetal gestation. Maternal risks of multifetal gestations include hypertension, diabetes, need for cesarean section, and acute fatty liver. Fetal risks include intrauterine growth restriction, birth defects, and preterm delivery. Selective reduction is an option for those with multifetal gestations but it is associated with a risk of loss of the entire pregnancy.

These steps may reduce the risks of multiple pregnancy and possibly lower the risk of OHSS. The goal number of follicles for ovulation is dependent on the clinical situation. In general, the desired number of follicles recruited increases with female reproductive age and is similar to the number of embryos one would suggest to be transferred during IVF. After appropriate follicular recruitment, ovulation can be monitored naturally (by monitoring urine luteinizing hormone with commercially available kits) or induced with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

As with spontaneous conception, increasing maternal age negatively impacts the live birth rate after embryo transfer when the patient&rsquo;s own eggs are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50854 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58270\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58270 \">figure 2</a>). This effect is particularly pronounced for women age 40 and greater (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62286 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p>The goal is to harvest a larger number of oocytes than would normally be ovulated; these oocytes would otherwise be lost to atresia. Because a larger number of oocytes are available, there are more resultant embryos than during a natural ovulatory cycle. During IVF, these embryos are observed for the first few days of development. There is evidence that the pattern of an embryo's development is correlated with its genetic health and therefore with the probability of implantation and further development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, IVF results in higher fecundity compared with natural cycles. The risks, benefits, and techniques available for IVF are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women who desire fertility treatment, at least one trial has reported that pursuing IVF instead of OI results in higher pregnancy rates with fewer treatment cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, women with extremely low ovarian reserve are not good candidates for IVF because the potential power of IVF is based on obtaining more oocytes than would normally be ovulated. For women of advanced reproductive age with low AMH, high FSH, and low antral follicle count, there can be a failure of multifollicular recruitment simply because of the low number of antral follicles present. If it is suspected that fewer than four to five oocytes will be obtained, IVF may present a challenge. As an example, a 43-year-old woman would need to generate six to eight oocytes during an IVF cycle in order to have four to five embryos to transfer (anticipated fertilization rate of 60 to 70 percent) and provide her with a 10 percent chance of live birth. In one retrospective cohort study, the live birth rate among all women with poor ovarian response during IVF was only 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, in our practice, for women age 40 and older undergoing an IVF cycle, we convert from IVF to IUI if fewer than three dominant follicles develop. Women who are unlikely to have an adequate ovarian response she should be counseled about other fertility treatments (eg, donor oocytes) and other family planning options (eg, adoption, foster parenting).</p><p>The American Society of Reproductive Medicine has published guidelines for age-appropriate numbers of embryos for transfer based on the age of the woman at the time the oocytes were retrieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112844\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112844 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These guidelines are based on predicted attrition of the embryo cohort and thus do not predict the outcome for any one woman. While transfer of more embryos increases the probability of pregnancy, the likelihood of multiple gestation also rises with increasing number of embryos transferred. Multifetal gestations can be effectively avoided in women of advanced reproductive age either through preimplantation genetic screening (resulting in transfer of only genetically euploid embryos) or selective reduction after implantation has occurred. As selective reduction is not acceptable to all women, these options are discussed prior to initiating IVF treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to control the rate of high order multiple gestation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triplet-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Triplet pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-complications-outcome-and-management-of-multiple-births\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal complications, outcome, and management of multiple births&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Expected outcomes for IVF, stratified by the age of the woman, are reported by both the <a href=\"http://www.sart.org/&amp;token=bqaJV26nDS1sWsmybQq3bNw/Tock7Dsu2JsofB2PTdI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=111561\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Society of Assisted Reproductive Technologies</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsS2w2f795le/W5BejjZJaFc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=111561\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Results are stratified by patient age because age is one of the single most important prognostic factors. Women less than 35 years old can expect an approximately 50 percent chance of live birth from an IVF cycle. This percentage of live birth with IVF drops with advancing reproductive age: 40 percent for women age 35 to 37 years, 25 percent for women age 38 to 40 years, and 12 percent for women ages 41 to 42 years. After age 43, the probability of live birth decreases to less than 5 percent; thus, many clinics will not provide IVF to women using autologous oocytes after the 44<sup>th</sup> birthday. Of note, the decreasing live birth rate by age occurs despite the fact that more embryos are transferred during IVF cycles in older women. In 2014 in the United States, for women undergoing transfer of fresh embryos from their own eggs, an average of 1.7 embryos were transferred in women under age 35, 1.9 embryos for women ages 35 to 37 years, and 2.3 embryos for women age &gt;37 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2746285417\"><span class=\"h3\">Preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who undergo IVF have the opportunity to have their embryos tested for aneuploidy prior to transfer (preimplantation genetic screening [PGS]) or tested for specific genetic diseases (preimplantation genetic diagnosis [PGD]). As the number of aneuploid oocytes increases with advancing maternal age, with resultant increased miscarriage and decreased live birth rates, the opportunity for screening can be an important advantage of IVF for women considering fertility therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In a trial of over 200 women ages 38 to 41 years undergoing IVF comparing PGS with no PGS prior to blastocyst transfer, the women in the PGS group required fewer embryo transfers (68 versus 91 percent), had lower miscarriage rates (3 versus 39 percent), and had higher live birth rates after the first transfer, both per transfer (53 versus 24 percent) and per patient (36 verus 22 percent), compared with the no-PGS group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Although there were no differences in the cumulative delivery rates per patient by six months after study closure, the women in the PGS group had a lower mean number of embryo transfers per live birth (1.8 versus 3.7) and a shorter time to pregnancy (7.7 versus 14.9 weeks) compared with the no-PGS women. Of note, the use of PGS improved outcomes despite resulting in a lower number of cycles that reached embryo transfer (69 versus 91 percent for PGS and no-PGS, respectively), mainly because of the large reduction in miscarriage rate for the women in the PGS group. Based on this trial, we offer PGS to women of all ages who are proceeding with IVF. However, based upon age-related risk of aneuploidy; PGS is primarily utilized by women over the age of 35 years and encouraged for women 38 and older who wish to avoid aneuploidy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-screening#H430015509\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic screening&quot;, section on 'Role of PGS versus PGD'</a>.)</p><p>During PGS, a cell or cells are removed from the embryos and tested for chromosomal anomalies; only the chromosomally normal embryos are transferred. PGS does not guarantee a successful pregnancy but reduces the risk of a chromosomally abnormal pregnancy. PGS also enables single embryo transfer, an important step in preventing multifetal gestation. Limitations include that potentially normal embryos could be damaged during manipulation and an embryo could give an erroneous signal resulting in wastage of a potentially normal embryo or alternatively, an abnormal embryo could give a falsely reassuring result. Such error rates are believed to be less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Unfortunately, because social and financial issues are important in family building, discussing timely family building can create a great deal of discomfort for patients as they may feel that they are unable to control many of the factors that influence the time frame in which they can build a family. In a study of reproductive age Japanese men and women comparing fertility education with control interventions, the group who received fertility education reported greater knowledge but also more anxiety. A study of female clinicians revealed that almost half would have made other reproductive choices if they had known more about fertility and infertility earlier in their careers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>An additional challenge is that clinicians often do not have an accurate understanding of age-related fertility changes.

For this reason, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine advises careful counseling of women who inquire about this technology about risks, expected success rates, and costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-infertility-in-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

This decline in fertility is likely multifactorial. Women are born with a fixed number of oocytes, which declines with age, and the quality of oocytes also declines with age because meiotic errors occur more frequently as age rises.

In addition to giving thought to test results, there are social and financial considerations. In our practice, if there are no medical, financial, or social limitations, we suggest a more aggressive approach with women <strong>age 35 years and older</strong> with infertility and offer them treatment as follows (see <a href=\"#H1651631762\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who do not have adequate ovarian reserve, we recommend using donor oocytes or alternate family planning options, such as adoption or surrogacy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
