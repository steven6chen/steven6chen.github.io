SUI occurs when an increase in intraabdominal pressure exceeds urethral closure pressure, resulting in the involuntary leakage of urine. This may occur with exertion, sneezing, or coughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Management options for SUI include conservative and surgical treatments. Midurethral sling placement has replaced other procedures (eg, retropubic colposuspension, bladder neck slings) as the procedure of choice for many women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The tension-free vaginal tape (TVT), introduced by Ulmsten in 1996, was the first synthetic retropubic midurethral sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

These procedures vary by the location of the sling and by the sling material. Collectively, these slings are referred to as suburethral slings, which is a sling that is inserted through a small vaginal incision and attached to another structure in the pelvis for the purpose of supporting the urethra. Suburethral slings may be either bladder neck or midurethral slings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midurethral sling</strong> &ndash; A suburethral sling that is placed at the level of the midurethra in a tension-free manner. These slings are made of synthetic mesh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Retropubic midurethral slings</strong> (eg, tension-free vaginal tape [TVT], TVT Exact) are inserted through the retropubic space and exit through the abdominal wall in the suprapubic area bottom-to-top (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59114\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59114 \">figure 1</a>) or they are inserted starting at the abdominal wall and exit under the midurethra (top-to-bottom [eg, Lynx, Desara]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transobturator midurethral slings</strong> are inserted in-to-out through the vaginal incision, through the obturator foramen and exit through the skin of the groin area (eg, TVT-O) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52240 \">figure 2</a>) or they are inserted out-to-in through the groin incision, through the obturator foramen and exiting the vaginal suburethral incision (eg, Obtryx, Desara ).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Single incision midurethral slings </strong>(eg, Solyx, Ajust, Altis) differ from full-length retropubic and transobturator slings in two ways: they are shorter (approximately 8 cm rather than 40 cm) and they require only a vaginal incision, and not an abdominal incision. Different types of these slings may be placed in a retropubic (anchored to the urogenital diaphragm) or transobturator fashion (anchored to the obturator internus muscle).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder neck sling</strong> &ndash; A suburethral sling that is placed at the level of the proximal urethra and bladder neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76965 \">figure 3</a>). This procedure is usually performed using both vaginal and abdominal incisions. These slings can be made of either biologic materials (including the patient's own tissue) or synthetic mesh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bladder neck slings are also referred to as proximal urethral slings. Alternatively, they are referred to as pubovaginal slings when the arms of the sling material are affixed to the anterior rectus fascia rather than the pubic bone or Cooper's ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2819310\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Midurethral sling placement involves the introduction of a polypropylene tape (approximately 1 cm in width) covered in a plastic sheath beneath the midportion of the urethra. This sling functions as a backboard that offers resistance beneath the urethra during increases in intraabdominal pressure, but is tension-free at rest. Ultrasound data suggest that continence is achieved by compression of the urethra between the sling and the pubic symphysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>For retropubic midurethral slings, the tails of the mesh pass through the retropubic space, rectus sheath, subcutaneous tissue and skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59114\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59114 \">figure 1</a>). Once the plastic sheaths are removed, the tape is held in place by its interface with the patient&rsquo;s tissue; it is not held in place by sutures. The friction that initially secures the mesh is eventually reinforced with tissue fibrosis develops around and through the mesh. Porcine models demonstrate that 74 percent of the final strength has already been achieved by two weeks postoperatively and maximum strength of tissue in-growth into polypropylene mesh occurs at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25744285\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL CANDIDATES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3791434\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for midurethral sling placement are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic SUI</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are planning repair of prolapse of the vaginal apex and who have known or suspected occult SUI</p><p/><p>Symptomatic SUI may be treated with a conservative (pelvic floor muscle training, incontinence pessaries) or a surgical approach.

Documented cure rates of 70 to 90 percent for the TVT as a secondary procedure have been shown with one to five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

While the autologous fascial sling was historically the preferred treatment for ISD, the overall safety and efficacy of the midurethral sling has changed this paradigm. In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of the retropubic midurethral sling with the transobturator midurethral sling, the retropubic approach resulted in a 10 percent higher subjective cure rate in patients defined to have ISD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299273\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to midurethral retropubic sling placement include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current urinary tract infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structures in the retropubic space that are in the path of sling placement (eg, vascular graft, bowel, transplanted pelvic kidney)</p><p/><p>Current pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to midurethral sling placement. Plans for future pregnancy are a relative contraindication. Since pelvic support may be disrupted during pregnancy, and particularly following a vaginal birth, most physicians recommend delaying surgical management of SUI until childbearing has been completed. (See <a href=\"#H298966\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The procedure is contraindicated in patients who are anticoagulated. Midurethral sling placement involves passing trocars through several tissue layers and may result in hematoma formation or hemorrhage. The risk of hematoma formation is probably more with retropubic approaches than with transobturator approaches, so women with bleeding diatheses (eg, Von Willebrand&rsquo;s) may be better served with administration of preoperative control measures (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>) and a transobturator approach.</p><p>Certain conditions or previous retropubic surgery may predispose to complications during sling placement. Previous retropubic surgery may have resulted in the presence of bowel in the retropubic space or an inguinal or abdominal hernia sac may be located along the pathway of trocar placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The retropubic and transobturator approaches have been shown to have comparable efficacy in randomized trials.

The TVT-Exact is a variation of the standard TVT with a smaller diameter trocar.</p><p>The bottom-to-top approach appears to be superior. A meta-analysis of five randomized trials, including a total of 636 women, compared bottom-to-top (TVT) and top-to-bottom (SPARC) procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The TVT was slightly more effective; at up to one-year follow-up, the TVT group had higher subjective cure rates (85 versus 77 percent; RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20) and objective cure rates (92 versus 87 percent; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). In addition, complications occurred less frequently in the TVT group, including: bladder perforation (4.7 versus 8.5 percent; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.98); vaginal mesh erosion (0.7 versus 3.5 percent; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08-0.95); and voiding dysfunction (2.2 versus 6.0 percent; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.90). Some surgeons feel more comfortable with top-to-bottom insertion, because they are familiar with this approach for needle suspension procedures.

The rationale for this approach is that a patient who is awake and has no abdominal muscle blockade can perform a urinary stress (cough) test, allowing sling tension to be adjusted if leakage of urine is noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The urinary stress test is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21990989\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'Clinical tests'</a>.)</p><p>The use of regional anesthesia alters the results of the urinary stress test, but does not appear to affect sling success rates. When the urinary stress test is performed under regional anesthesia, less intraabdominal pressure is generated by the cough, but urethral resistance is lower (increasing the tendency to leak urine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. These conditions differ from normal function, and thus, it is uncertain whether it is valid to adjust the sling tension based upon these results. In contrast, periurethral infiltration of local anesthetic does not appear to alter urethral function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>In our practice, we do not routinely perform a urinary stress test, regardless of type of anesthesia, since there is no evidence that the results of the test impact outcome. &#160;</p><p>The efficacy of sling placement under regional anesthesia was demonstrated in a randomized trial comparing spinal and local anesthesia in 103 women undergoing a TVT procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. At 13-month follow-up, the spinal and local anesthesia groups showed no significant differences in subjective SUI cure rates (97 versus 94 percent) and postoperative urinary retention (14 versus 12 percent). Patient comfort level during the procedure was not assessed in this study. </p><p>Use of general anesthesia may be associated with detrimental effects on midurethral sling outcomes. The best available data comparing midurethral sling placement under local or regional anesthesia with general anesthesia are from two large prospective cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In one study (n = 809), at two-year follow-up, a lower subjective SUI cure rate was associated with general anesthesia compared with local anesthesia (68 versus 81 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another study (n = 500), the rate of postoperative voiding dysfunction was significantly higher in women who received general anesthesia (17 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Based upon these data, we suggest use of local anesthesia with conscious sedation or regional anesthesia rather than general anesthesia for midurethral sling placement, when it is being performed as an isolated procedure. General anesthesia may be used if it is preferred by the patient or if it is required for a concomitant procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299003\"><span class=\"h2\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TVT system consists of a non-disposable metal handle to which two metal needles and sling can be attached.

Insert the bladder catheter. The bladder should be completely drained prior to dissection and again prior to placement of the catheter guide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Marking abdominal incisions </strong>&ndash; Mark the two planned abdominal exit points for the tape at the superior margin of the pubic bone, 2 cm lateral to the midline. Some surgeons make small stab incisions at these locations to facilitate trocar passage through the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydrodissection </strong>&ndash; Some surgeons hydrodissect the vaginal incision site <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the path of the trocars. Either local anesthetic (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) or sterile saline may be used. In the original description of the procedure, 40 ml of fluid was injected into the vaginal wall inferior and lateral to the urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An additional 60 to 70 mL of fluid was injected at the planned abdominal incision sites and downward along the back of the pubic bone to the retropubic space. Alternatively, fluid may be injected into the retropubic space through the vaginal sulci.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midurethral vaginal incision</strong> &ndash; Make a vertical (longitudinal) vaginal incision, starting 1 cm proximal to the urethral meatus and 1 to 1.5 cm in length to accommodate the width of the sling in the appropriate location. Place Allis clamps on the lateral edges of the incision to provide exposure by retracting the vaginal mucosa laterally. The best ways to prevent a midurethral sling from being too proximal are to start the vaginal incision for the midurethral sling 1 cm from the urethral meatus, as recommended by Ulmsten in the original TVT publication, and to never use an anterior repair incision to place the midurethral sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Minimal dissection lateral to the midurethra, between the vaginal mucosa and the pubocervical fascia, is performed bilaterally with the Metzenbaum scissors. The scissors are angled towards the retropubic space just behind the pubic symphysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lateral deviation of the bladder</strong> &ndash; Drain the bladder completely and introduce the rigid catheter guide into the bladder catheter.

Pass the trocar behind the pubic symphysis (through the retropubic space) and exit through the abdominal incision sites. The trocar is left in place with the tip just past the level of the abdominal skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Techniques to prevent complications</strong> &ndash; The trocars must be passed along the correct path without deviation to avoid complications. Small deviations of the trocar handle create a magnified deviation of the tip of the trocar, resulting in potential injury to adjacent structures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Deviation of the trocar in a cephalad direction may result in injury to bowel, bladder, or blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Deviation of the trocar lateral to the posterior surface of the pubic symphysis may cause serious vascular injury. Major vessels (eg, external iliac vessel, obturator vessels, epigastric vessels) may be located as close as 0.9 cm from the correct path of the trocars and the mean distance from the trocar to the major vessels is 3.2 to 4.9 cm (range 0.9 to 6.6 cm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70874 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Techniques for successful placement include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The operator must maintain a firm grasp of the trocar and handle while manipulating the needle through the tissues. Resistance of the tissues may sometimes result in deviation of the needle. Some surgeons use a hand in the vagina to control and direct the trocar while the opposite hand on the handle is used to apply gentle force to advance the trocar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care should be taken to aim the trocar handle in the direction of the outer aspect of the patient&rsquo;s ipsilateral shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The tip of the trocar should be positioned just behind the pubic symphysis. It is often helpful to actually place the tip of the trocar on the underside of the pubic symphysis and to gently slide it behind the bone, staying as close to the bone as possible. To do this, the surgeon must lower the hand that is holding the trocar handle so that the curve of the insertion needle follows the posterior surface of the pubic bone through the retropubic space. The trocar should pass easily in the retropubic space in direct opposition to the posterior side of the symphysis. More force is needed when the trocar passes through the rectus sheath and then out through the skin at the suprapubic level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The trocar handle must be kept parallel to the floor during retropubic passage to prevent the lateral rotation of the trocar tip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After insertion, the anterior vaginal sulci are inspected and palpated to ensure that they have not been perforated by the trocar. If there is a perforation, then the trocar or the plastic sheaths with the mesh can be seen traversing the vaginal sulcus. The first sign of a vaginal perforation is often the onset of vaginal bleeding that does not appear to be coming from the midurethral vaginal incision.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4700435\"><span class=\"h3\">Cystourethroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After each trocar is placed, perform cystourethroscopy to inspect for bladder perforation. A 70 degree cystoscope should be used and the bladder filled adequately to allow complete examination of the urethra and bladder surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Examination of the bladder requires an experienced clinician; a study of surgical trainees reported that 37 percent of bladder injuries were missed on cystourethroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Intravenous administration of 10 percent sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> (0.25 to 1.0 mL) may be used to check for ureteric flow if ureteral injury is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This has been used with success in our practice due to the unavailability of indigotindisulfonate sodium (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2451122\"><span class=\"h3\">Completing the trocar insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step in the procedure depends upon the findings of cystourethroscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is no bladder injury, the bladder catheter and rigid catheter guide are replaced. The rigid catheter guide is deviated to the other side and the contralateral trocar is inserted using the same procedure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a bladder perforation has occurred, the trocar should be withdrawn and the bladder emptied completely. The trocar can then be replaced while hugging the posterior surface of the pubic bone. Cystourethroscopy is repeated. This can usually be accomplished even in the presence of a bladder perforation, since the defects at the perforation sites result in only a minimal amount of fluid loss. If there is no further bladder injury, the rigid catheter guide is deviated to the other side and the contralateral trocar is inserted using the same procedure.</p><p/><p>When both trocars have been inserted and cystourethroscopy is complete, the trocar handles are removed. The remaining portions of both trocars and the mesh are then passed through the skin. The plastic sheaths are left in place and the mesh is left slack at the midurethra to allow the tension to be adjusted. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4700493\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjusting sling tension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To ensure that the sling is tension-free and does not compress the urethra while the patient is at rest, many surgeons insert an instrument (eg, Kelly clamp, Heaney clamp, needle holder, or number 8 Hegar dilator) between the sling and the urethra while adjusting the sling tension.</p><p>An intraoperative urinary (cough) stress test may be performed at this time if the patient is under local anesthesia. If leakage occurs, the sling is tightened slightly. In our practice, we do not routinely perform a urinary stress test, regardless of type of anesthesia, since there is no evidence that the results of the test impact outcome. (See <a href=\"#H579368\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.) </p><p>With the spacer in place, remove the plastic sheaths; this prevents excess tightening of the mesh during plastic sheath removal. The surgeon should assess the entire plastic sheath to confirm that it has been completely removed.</p><p>Trim the mesh at the abdominal incisions. Mesh protrusion and irritation at the skin surface can be prevented by depressing the skin slightly to trim the mesh just below the skin surface. The mesh does not require suturing, since it is held in by friction and then fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4700982\"><span class=\"h3\">Closure of incisions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal incision</strong> &ndash; At our institution, we close the vaginal mucosa with a horizontal mattress configuration to evert the edge away from the mesh using an absorbable suture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Suprapubic skin incisions</strong> &ndash; This can be performed in a variety of ways (suture, adhesive strips, surgical glue, no closure), based upon surgeon preference.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22194879\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative voiding trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A voiding trial is performed prior to patient discharge or four to six hours after surgery, if an inpatient admission is planned. In a retrospective review of nearly 170 women who underwent a retropubic midurethral sling insertion (brand TVT), 80 percent had a successful voiding trial in the same day and 97 percent had a successful voiding trial within one day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for delayed voiding included age &ge;65 years and use of Valsalva voiding. In a different retrospective case-control study of 464 women, approximately 80 percent of women also had a successful initial voiding trial; medical comorbidities were predictive of an unsuccessful voiding trial in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>A voiding trial can be performed in two different ways: retrograde or spontaneous filling of the bladder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrograde bladder filling &ndash; The bladder catheter is left in place at the end of the procedure. Once the patient has completely recovered from anesthesia, the bladder is completely drained through the catheter. The bladder catheter can then be attached to a catheter-tipped syringe with the piston removed or an irrigation syringe. Using only gravity to fill, 300 ml of sterile normal saline or water at room temperature is instilled into the bladder. The catheter is then removed, and the patient is asked to void in a toilet hat or measured container. The postvoid residual volume is calculated (by subtracting the voided volume from the volume instilled). Although there is no consensus on a residual that implies a low rate of subsequent urinary retention, we consider a successful voiding trial to be a postvoid residual that is &lt;150 mL or less than half the filled amount. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous bladder filling &ndash; The bladder catheter is removed at the end of the procedure. Once the patient has completely recovered from anesthesia and feels that her bladder is full, she is asked to void. The voided volume is collected and measured and the postvoid residual volume is measured either using a bladder ultrasound or a bladder catheter. A successful voiding trial can be defined as a postvoid residual of &lt;150 ml. </p><p/><p>It is uncertain which approach to bladder filling is superior. This question has been evaluated in two randomized trials of women who underwent transvaginal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In one trial, the proportion of women that had an unsuccessful voiding trial and were discharged home with a bladder catheter was significantly lower in the retrograde group (32 versus 62 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], while in the other trial, the rate of unsuccessful trials was the same for both groups (65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The different findings may reflect the different methodology of the two trials; in one, the voiding trial was performed within hours of the end of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] and, in the other, two voiding trials were performed on the first postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, the applicability of these results to midurethral sling placement is somewhat limited, since many participants in both trials (55 to 60 percent) underwent procedures other than sling placement. </p><p>If a patient fails her voiding trial, she can either go home with an indwelling bladder catheter or she can be taught intermittent self catheterization. Women who vail the voiding trial can be reassured that their surgical success rate is not compromised and some evidence suggests it may be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Management of women with postoperative voiding dysfunction is described below. (See <a href=\"#H22194935\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative catheter management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25744489\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retropubic midurethral sling placement is a minimally invasive procedure and complications are uncommon. The most frequent complications of this procedure are bladder perforation, voiding dysfunction, and development of urinary urgency symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4701067\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tract complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4700528\"><span class=\"h3\">Bladder injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative bladder perforation is the most common complication of retropubic midurethral sling placement. In studies of 200 or more procedures, the reported rate ranges between 3.5 to 6.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. In large registries including up to 4281 women, the bladder perforation rate was low (2.7 to 3.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Bladder perforation does not appear to be associated with reduced SUI cure rates or with long-term sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood of bladder perforation depends upon the surgeon&rsquo;s experience. A report of 600 procedures performed by an experienced surgeon had a 1 percent rate of bladder perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], while inexperienced operators have reported rates ranging from 15 to 34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/39,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,53</a>].</p><p>Bladder perforation is usually diagnosed with intraoperative cystoscopy. Leaving the trocar in place prior to cystourethroscopy facilitates identification of this type of injury. Bladder management after perforation depends upon the site and extent of perforation. Bladder perforations in the posterior bladder closer to the vaginal incision are theoretically at a higher risk of fistula formation than the more common anterior perforations near the dome of the bladder. Management varies, but surgeons typically continuously drain the bladder with a urethral catheter in place for one to several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, in a retrospective study, 25 women with a bladder perforation passed a voiding trial on the day of the procedure and were discharged without a catheter and had no adverse events, suggesting that patients with perforation who do not have gross hematuria and pass a voiding trial at discharge may be safely discharged without a catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In our practice, after the more common anterior perforation, we leave the bladder catheter in place for one day and typically remove the catheter without an imaging study. A posterior perforation near the trigone and near the vaginal incision is more concerning; we drain the bladder for at least seven days and perform a cystogram to exclude extravasation before discontinuing the bladder drainage. (See <a href=\"#H4700179\" class=\"local\">'Initial trocar insertion'</a> above.) </p><p>It is important to recognize bladder and urethral perforations at the time of the initial procedure because delayed recognition is associated with significantly more morbidity. Occult bladder injury should be suspected if fluid leaks persistently from the vagina or the abdominal incision sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Unrecognized injuries appear to occur more frequently in women with prior retropubic surgery. In women in whom bladder perforation is recognized after the mesh has been passed, we remove all of the sling material from the bladder. This may be performed using laparotomy, cystoscopy, or cystoscopy assisted by suprapubic laparoscopic instruments. </p><p>Another mechanism of bladder injury is erosion of the mesh through the bladder wall; this complication is uncommon and the incidence is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Some reported cases of mesh erosion may have been bladder perforations that were not recognized at the time of surgery. Others may represent a true erosion of mesh that slowly extrudes through the tissue over time.</p><p>Vesical erosion typically presents several weeks to months postoperatively as urinary urgency, hematuria, or bladder stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. This condition is diagnosed with cystoscopy. There are a variety of management options, including: cystoscopic resection using laser or scissors, cystoscopic-guided suprapubic laparoscopic resection, and suprapubic telescopy (cystoscopy through a suprapubic incision) with suprapubic or transurethral instrumentation.

The timing of sling release is controversial. Most voiding dysfunction resolves spontaneously so if there is improvement the patient can be observed for up to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, if there is complete retention or small voids with large residuals, a sling release or sling loosening at one to two weeks after the initial procedure is reasonable. After two weeks, tissue ingrowth rarely allows sling loosening. In a study of billing codes of over 180,000 women who underwent a midurethral sling procedure between 2001 and 2010, the cumulative rate of sling release performed for the indication of urinary retention was 1.3 percent at nine years postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

There are few data regarding the results of sling release. In a retrospective study of 23 women who underwent sling release following TVT: all patients had complete resolution of urinary retention; 14 (61 percent) had complete cure of SUI; 6 (26 percent) had partial improvement in SUI symptoms; and 3 (13 percent) had failure of SUI treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

Many women also have vaginal spotting for up to two weeks.</p><p>We counsel patients to call their surgeon if they experience symptoms that may be associated with a serious complication, including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy vaginal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light-headedness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe or persistent abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting or persistent nausea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge of clear fluid or blood from the incision sites that is copious or persistent or any amount of purulent or feculent discharge</p><p/><p>Patients who present with these symptoms should be promptly evaluated. </p><p>Urinary retention may occur even after a successful postoperative voiding trial. Patients who feel a persistent sense of urinary retention or incomplete bladder emptying should have a postvoid residual volume measured and may require catheterization. (See <a href=\"#H22194935\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative catheter management'</a> above.) </p><p>The sling is initially held in place solely by frictional tissue forces, and patients must allow adequate time for tissue in-growth to occur before significant intraabdominal pressure is applied to the mesh. Patients are advised to avoid heavy lifting, actions that increase intraabdominal pressure, or exercise for at least two weeks. Ambulation, however, is encouraged. Sexual activity should be avoided until the vaginal epithelium is healed, which takes approximately six weeks.</p><p>The patient may return to work when she feels sufficiently comfortable. </p><p>We see patients for a routine follow-up visit at four to six weeks. We perform abdominal and vaginal examinations to ensure that the incisions have adequately healed and to check for vaginal mesh erosion. The vaginal sulci are visualized and palpated to confirm that there are no occult extrusions of mesh. We check a postvoid residual volume to assess whether the patient has been adequately emptying her bladder. This can be measured with a bladder ultrasound or catheterization. </p><p>Patient information regarding care after pelvic surgery can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-gynecologic-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Care after gynecologic surgery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4550776\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent or recurrent SUI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who present at the postoperative visit after a retropubic midurethral sling procedure and report persistent stress urinary incontinence, the position of the sling should be evaluated. The midurethra is largely considered the continence zone of the urethra and careful positioning of the sling beneath this portion of the urethra has been shown to achieve the highest rates of continence. Clinicians may assess positioning of the sling with palpation along the urethra. They may also check for the presence or absence of urethral hypermobility. </p><p>Three-dimensional transperineal, translabial, and endovaginal ultrasound can be used to evaluate sling position and correlate position with surgical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Ultrasound can also differentiate between transobturator and retropubic slings, provide information on mesh type, and locate mesh and mesh position which can often be difficult to find on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. As an example, a case control study evaluated 100 patients following transobturator sling surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Based upon three-dimensional transperineal ultrasound, a transobturator sling that moved concordantly with the urethra during dynamic testing, was located in the midurethra, and deformed appropriately with stress maneuvers was associated with the best success rates. Unsuccessful slings were often positioned too proximally. </p><p>In our experience, the most common cause of midurethral sling failure is incorrect placement (typically at the bladder neck instead of the mid urethra). When a midurethral sling is too proximal, continence can be achieved by placing a repeat midurethral sling properly under the midurethra without removing the non-functioning sling.</p><p>The evaluation and management of persistent or recurrent SUI after continence surgery is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-persistent-recurrent-symptoms-after-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress urinary incontinence in women: Persistent/recurrent symptoms after surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298966\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since pelvic support may be disrupted during pregnancy, and particularly following a vaginal birth, most physicians recommend delaying midurethral sling placement until childbearing has been completed. </p><p>In women who become pregnant following anti-incontinence surgery, the best choice for mode of delivery is uncertain. A review of case reports suggested that vaginal delivery was associated with a higher risk of recurrent incontinence than cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>], but a survey of physicians who had performed 3400 retropubic or transobturator midurethral sling procedures reported no difference in incontinence rates (vaginal delivery: 20 percent; cesarean: 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Subsequently, a population-based cohort study of Swedish women who were pregnant following midurethral sling surgery reported no differences in SUI rates between pregnant and control women or between the vaginal and cesarean delivery groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. While women of childbearing age who elect surgical treatment are counseled on the paucity of data regarding the preferred mode of delivery and the risk of recurrent incontinence following delivery, the limited available data suggest that either mode of delivery is safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/106,107,109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107,109,110</a>]. In retrospective review of 26 women who became pregnant and delivered after placement of a midurethral sling, 14 underwent cesarean section and 11 had vaginal births. There were no midurethral sling-related pregnancy consequences. One patient had a repeat midurethral sling for recurrent SUI postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

Midurethral sling placement is the procedure of choice for treatment of SUI in many women. Midurethral slings may be placed either through the retropubic or transobturator spaces. (See <a href=\"#H25744271\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative contraindications for retropubic midurethral sling placement include future plans for pregnancy and an increased risk of injury to retropubic structures (ie, due to prior surgery or a current hernia that may result in the presence of viscera or major vessels in the retropubic space). (See <a href=\"#H299273\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are planning primary midurethral retropubic sling placement should undergo preoperative evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of SUI, exclude other etiologies of urinary incontinence, confirm normal bladder emptying, and assess surgical risk. (See <a href=\"#H297972\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Preoperative evaluation for a primary procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical site infection for surgical procedures for treatment of pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence that utilize surgical mesh (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H2819431\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a type of retropubic sling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest use of local anesthesia with conscious sedation or regional anesthesia rather than general anesthesia for midurethral sling placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). General anesthesia may be used if it is preferred by the patient or if it is required for a concomitant procedure. (See <a href=\"#H579368\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During sling placement, the trocars must be passed along the correct path without deviation to avoid complications. Small deviations of the trocar handle create a magnified deviation of the tip of the trocar, resulting in potential injury to adjacent structures.
