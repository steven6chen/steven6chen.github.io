When a patient presents with anisocoria, the fear of a serious condition, such as an intracranial aneurysm, often leads clinicians to obtain numerous tests, which are not always necessary. A logical clinical approach appreciating the mechanisms of anisocoria permits prompt recognition of true emergencies and often obviates the need for invasive and costly testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71260\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71260 \">algorithm 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pupillary size is governed by the balance of actions of two opposing muscle groups of the iris: the dilator and sphincter pupillae. Regulation of the pupillary size is predominantly achieved by reflex mechanisms in response to the amount of ambient light. Other factors influencing pupillary size include patient age, emotional state (adrenergic tone), state of arousal, and intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Constriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pupillary constriction to light and near stimuli is mediated via parasympathetic (cholinergic) nerve fibers that travel along the third cranial nerve. The pupillary light reflex pathway is a four neuron pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57842 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light information from retinal ganglion cells travels though the optic nerves, optic chiasm (where the nasal fibers decussate), and the optic tracts, before synapsing in the pretectal nuclei of the dorsal midbrain. Both pretectal nuclei receive input from both eyes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each pretectal nucleus sends axons to both Edinger-Westphal nuclei. This duality of pathways provides the anatomic basis for the consensual response to light (ie, the fact that both pupils constrict equally in response to a light stimulus in one eye).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasympathetic fibers for pupillary constriction travel along the third cranial nerve to the ipsilateral ciliary ganglion within the orbit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pupillary sphincter muscle (and ciliary muscle for lens accommodation) is innervated by the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers.</p><p/><p>The constriction of the pupil to near stimuli is also accomplished through the parasympathetic pathways. The near-reflex pathway descends from higher cortical centers directly to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei, bypassing the pretectal nuclei in the dorsal midbrain. This distinction between the light and near pathways forms the basis for some forms of pupillary light-near dissociation (ie, pupils that do not react to light but react to near stimuli), in which the dorsal midbrain and pretectal nuclei are damaged selectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pupillary dilation is mediated through three-neuron sympathetic (adrenergic) pathways that originate in the hypothalamus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62879 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first-order neuron descends caudally from the hypothalamus to the first synapse, which is located in the cervical spinal cord (levels C8-T2, also called ciliospinal center of Budge).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second-order neuron travels from the sympathetic trunk, through the brachial plexus, over the lung apex. It then ascends to the superior cervical ganglion located near the angle of the mandible and the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third-order neuron then ascends within the adventitia of the internal carotid artery, through the cavernous sinus, where it is in close relation to the sixth cranial nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The oculosympathetic pathway then joins the ophthalmic (V1) division of the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve). In the orbit and the eye, the oculosympathetic fibers innervate the iris dilator muscle as well as M&uuml;ller's muscle, a small smooth muscle in the eyelids responsible for a minor portion of the upper lid elevation and lower lid retraction.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION OF THE PUPIL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pupillary examination is best conducted in dim light. It is essential to turn the lights off to evaluate the pupils. Horner syndrome, in particular, is usually overlooked in an illuminated room. We often employ a storage room or closet if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A bright light (such as from a fully charged ophthalmoscope) and a pupillary size gauge (usually found on near acuity cards) are the only tools necessary for pupillary evaluation. The patient should be relaxed and fixing on a distant object, rather than focusing on the examiner's light, which may cause miosis from the pupillary near reaction.</p><p>The size, shape, and position of each pupil should be noted in light and dark conditions. In a normal patient, the pupils are symmetric in size (difference less than 0.4 mm), shape, and position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61265 \">figure 3</a>). Pupillary reactivity is then assessed to light and near stimuli.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Light reflex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pupillary reaction should be observed both when the light is shined into the eye (observe the pupillary constriction in both eyes) and later as the light is moved down and away from the eye. The magnitude, speed, and symmetry of the direct and consensual responses should be noted:</p><p>Dilation lag is the asymmetry in pupillary redilation between the two eyes when the light source is moved away from the eye. It is usually indicative of a sympathetic innervation abnormality causing slower dilation of the affected pupil (Horner syndrome), but is also a feature of the tonic (or Adie's) pupil (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81184\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81184 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>A relative afferent pupillary defect is noted when one pupil's direct response to light is more sluggish than in the opposite eye. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;, section on 'Afferent pupillary defect'</a>.) This is a sensitive test for an abnormality of the afferent visual pathways (eg, optic neuropathy). However, a relative afferent pupillary defect does not cause anisocoria even with severely decreased visual acuity in one eye. There is no anisocoria because of the intact consensual pupillary response to light.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Near reflex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The near target reaction is tested when the light response is abnormal. This is assessed with an accommodative target such as reading the near acuity card, viewed at about one foot from the eyes. In patients who are unable to converge or are blind, the near reaction can be elicited by having the patient look at their thumb when held at reading distance. The degree of pupillary constriction to near target is normally less than that seen with direct light stimulation.</p><p>Light-near dissociation is said to exist when the light reaction is impaired with a normal near reaction. Causes of light-near dissociation are listed in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60550\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60550 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The figure shows a stepwise clinical approach to diagnosis in a patient with anisocoria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71260\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71260 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying the abnormal side</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to determine whether the abnormal pupil is the large pupil or the small pupil by carefully evaluating the pupillary reactions in dark and light conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61265 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The small pupil is abnormal if anisocoria is greater in the dark than in light, indicating poor pupillary dilation on the abnormal side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61265 \">figure 3</a>). This indicates an abnormality of the sympathetic system.</p><p>The larger pupil is abnormal if anisocoria is greater in the light than in dark, indicating poor pupillary constriction on the abnormal side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61265 \">figure 3</a>).

The magnitude of anisocoria may be equal in light and dark, or slightly greater in the dark than in light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The anisocoria is usually less than 0.4 mm difference between sides. There is no dilation lag.</p><p>Reviewing the patient's old photographs or driver's license (with a magnifying glass) may help establish the diagnosis, as physiologic anisocoria is usually persistent. Depending on the degree of ambient lighting, the anisocoria may seem to come and go. Occasionally, the anisocoria may switch sides.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular causes responsible for structural defects of the iris can lead to anisocoria and abnormal pupillary shapes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81796\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81796 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Congenital defects such as aniridia, iris coloboma, congenital ectopic pupils, persistent pupillary membrane, polycoria, congenital heterochromia, Rieger's syndrome, and other developmental anomalies of the anterior segment can produce anisocoria, which is usually present in childhood.</p><p>Numerous acquired ocular conditions, such as intraocular inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">(iritis/iridocyclitis),</span> anterior segment ischemia, trauma, iris sphincter atrophy related to surgical or traumatic injury, mechanical distortion by an intraocular tumor, and angle-closure glaucoma, also produce anisocoria. Associated visual loss, ocular redness, or ocular pain is usually present with acute glaucoma. In the absence of a clear history of one of these disorders, an ophthalmologic evaluation with slit lamp examination will usually reveal the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">The small pupil is abnormal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the small pupil does not dilate as well as the large pupil in dim light, then the small pupil is abnormal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61265 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>This can occur due to ocular conditions that keep the small pupil from dilating (such as iridocyclitis, previous ocular surgery, or pseudoexfoliation syndrome) or to pharmacologic constriction of the pupil (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> eye drops). In the absence of these, asymmetric pupillary miosis usually results from dysfunction of the ipsilateral sympathetic pathway, ie, oculosympathetic paresis or Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Horner syndrome is caused by a lesion anywhere along the sympathetic pathway that supplies the head, eye, and neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62879 \">figure 2</a>). The amount of anisocoria is worse in the dark than in the light, and it is associated with dilation lag of 15 to 20 seconds. Topical administration of one to two drops of 4 to 10 percent cocaine may be required to distinguish a Horner syndrome from physiologic anisocoria. A normal pupil dilates more than the Horner pupil, increasing the degree of anisocoria, a response not seen in physiologic anisocoria.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=apraclonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Apraclonidine</a> drops (used for glaucoma) are now more often used than cocaine to confirm a Horner syndrome, and are widely available, while cocaine eye drops may not be. Apraclonidine has no effect on the size of a normal pupil, but moderately dilates a Horner pupil and increases the palpebral fissure on the side of the Horner syndrome; in effect, apraclonidine reverses the Horner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=horner-syndrome#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Horner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic tests'</a>.)</p><p>Classic signs of Horner syndrome also include ptosis and anhydrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54798 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67538 \">picture 4</a>). The ptosis is minor (2 mm or less) and may be missed. Ptosis involves both upper and lower lids. Unilateral anhidrosis is present in preganglionic lesions. Horner syndrome is discussed separately.

Appropriate investigations should be obtained once the mechanism of mydriasis is understood. Indeed, the non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) routinely ordered in the emergency department for a patient with mydriasis is not helpful and can be falsely reassuring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Traumatic mydriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pupillary dilation following ocular trauma often results from injury to the pupillary sphincter muscle. The pupil in such cases may be irregular in shape. Its ability to react to light and accommodation varies, depending on the extent of the damage. Anisocoria is more evident in bright light, as the pupil fails to constrict due to injury to the sphincter muscle. The pupillary abnormality is isolated without ptosis or diplopia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81796\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81796 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Tonic pupil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tonic pupil (also called Adie's pupil) results from damage to the ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerves followed by aberrant reinnervation. In the acute phase, findings may be isolated to unilateral mydriasis with poor light reactivity. Over days and weeks other characteristic signs develop:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light near dissociation. The pupil constricts poorly to light but reacts better to accommodation (near response) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81184\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81184 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tonic response.

Within 30 minutes of administration of two drops of dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> (0.1 percent) in both eyes, the initially larger Adie's pupil becomes smaller than the normal pupil, which does not usually change in size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81184\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81184 \">picture 1</a>).
