It is thought to be primarily a T cell mediated disease that occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the transplant recipient. The skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver are the principal target organs in patients with acute GVHD.</p><p>Clinically significant acute GVHD occurs in 9 to 50 percent of patients who receive an allogeneic HCT from a genotypically HLA-identical sibling, despite intensive prophylaxis with immunosuppressive agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, or antithymocyte globulin. Acute GVHD is more common following HCT from matched unrelated donors and haploidentical donors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of acute GVHD will be reviewed here. Specific recommendations for the prevention and diagnosis of GVHD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8072414\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8072421\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of GVHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylaxis of acute GVHD centers on immunosuppression of the donor cells, either pharmacologically or via T cell depletion. There is no agreed upon standard regimen, and clinical practice varies by institution. However, each institution must have guidelines for the prevention and management of GVHD in order to be acknowledged by international accrediting organizations. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H4622255\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Choice of prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8072435\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of GVHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute GVHD can involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. The diagnosis can be made readily on clinical grounds in the patient who presents with a classic rash, abdominal cramps with diarrhea, and a rising serum bilirubin concentration within the first 100 days following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), most often within two to three weeks following HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In many cases, however, the diagnosis is less straightforward, and competing causes for isolated abnormalities must be considered and excluded. A skin rash alone may be caused by antibiotics or a myriad of other drugs with which these patients are often treated including the preparative regimen; diarrhea may be infectious in nature; and hyperbilirubinemia may be related to biliary sludge or a side effect of multiple drugs or parenteral nutrition. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-with-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the adult with jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-liver-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced liver injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11941996\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who undergo HCT are at risk for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, the time course of which varies in the post-transplant period, according to the degree of immune deficiency and cytopenias induced by the transplantation procedure. Organ damage and immune suppression due to damage to lymph nodes and the thymus related to acute GVHD, as well as the immunosuppressive regimen used to treat GVHD, further increase the risk of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, prophylactic therapies are used to prevent infections. Strategies to prevent infections in HCT recipients with GVHD include the use of neutropenic (and HCT) precautions, antibacterial drugs, antiviral drugs, antifungal drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> infusions, and vaccinations. Recommendations for use of these strategies differ from one institution to another; the approach to prophylaxis in HCT recipients is discussed in greater detail separately.

Most treatment options are based on the immunosuppression of donor T cells, which are responsible for the clinical manifestations of GVHD. However, the same cells are likely responsible for an immunologic effect on the tumor. As such, treatment must aim to balance the benefit of reducing GVHD with the potential harm of decreasing a GVT effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H4622221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Balancing GVHD and GVT effect'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The severity of acute GVHD is determined by an assessment of the degree of involvement of the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68233 \">table 1</a>). Grade I GVHD describes cutaneous GVHD over &le;50 percent body surface area without liver or gastrointestinal tract involvement. All other manifestations of acute GVHD and more severe cutaneous disease are considered grade II or higher. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I GVHD &ndash; Management of mild cutaneous GVHD centers on the use of topical treatments (eg, topical steroids) and the optimization of prophylactic measures (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> levels). (See <a href=\"#H11942107\" class=\"local\">'Skin-directed therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II or higher GVHD &ndash; In addition to the care outlined for grade I GVHD, patients with more severe disease are treated with systemic glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>). Non-absorbable oral steroids are added as local therapy for most patients with gastrointestinal involvement. Non-absorbable oral steroids should not be used in patients with suspected gastrointestinal infection (eg, cytomegalovirus colitis). (See <a href=\"#H11943617\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal tract-directed therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>While there is no agreed upon standard approach to the treatment of GVHD, corticosteroids remain the mainstay of initial treatment and each institution must have guidelines for the management of GVHD in order to be acknowledged by the international accrediting organizations for transplant centers (Joint Accreditation Committee for ISCT Europe and EBMT [JACIE] and Foundation for the Accreditation of Cell Therapy [FACT]). </p><p>Guidelines for the treatment of acute GVHD have been proposed by the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; the British Committee for Standards in Hematology and the British Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and European LeukemiaNet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11941820\"><span class=\"h2\">Grade I GVHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grade I acute GVHD includes patients with a maculopapular rash over &le;50 percent of their body surface area without evidence of liver or gastrointestinal tract involvement. The management of grade I GVHD is directed towards the control of local symptoms and maximizing prophylactic agents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11942107\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin-directed therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, the first (and most common) clinical manifestation of acute GVHD is a maculopapular rash, usually occurring at or near the time of the white blood cell engraftment. Topical steroids are the most commonly used skin-directed therapy for acute GVHD. Antihistamines may be used as adjuvant therapy for patients with pruritus.</p><p>Topical steroids differ in their strength, vehicle (eg, ointments, creams, lotions), and method of application. In general, for cutaneous GVHD, mid- to high-potency topical steroids are applied twice daily to moist skin and covered with warm wet towels as an occlusive measure (&quot;wet wrap&quot;). The choice of topical steroid and duration of therapy must take into account the location of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;</a>.) </p><p>General measures for the management of pruritus include moisturizers, nonirritating creams, topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd#H878120\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)&quot;, section on 'Ancillary measures in chronic GVHD'</a>.)</p><p>There is no agreed upon second-line therapy for cutaneous disease that is resistant to topical steroids, and clinical practice varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One approach is to use topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Topical tacrolimus (0.1 percent for adults) is applied twice daily until resolution of symptoms. If the disease flares upon discontinuation, topical tacrolimus can be restarted at a lower dose (0.03 percent) and then discontinued upon resolution of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11942156\"><span class=\"h3\">Optimizing prophylactic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) with T cell replete grafts should receive prophylaxis for GVHD. When acute GVHD of any grade develops, the prophylactic regimen should be optimized to ensure a therapeutic level. For those no longer receiving prophylaxis, the prior prophylactic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) should be restarted to achieve therapeutic levels.</p><p>While practice varies, the most common prophylaxis regimen is the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The cyclosporine is administered to reach a therapeutic target concentration, which varies according to the time from transplantation. A target concentration of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> is used during the first three to four weeks post-transplant; then, if there is no GVHD, the target concentration is decreased to 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> until three months after transplantation, and then tapered further. Patients who develop GVHD of any grade should have their cyclosporine dose adjusted to ensure a therapeutic level (eg, 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> are closely related, several anecdotal reports suggest that tacrolimus may be used to treat patients who have failed prophylaxis with cyclosporine. Currently, however, these are only case reports and abstracts; there are no prospective studies to suggest the actual salvage rate with tacrolimus for those who have failed prophylaxis with cyclosporine. In a retrospective study, 2 of 20 evaluable patients had a complete resolution of GVHD after changing treatment to tacrolimus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11941834\"><span class=\"h2\">Grade II to IV GVHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, grade I GVHD describes cutaneous GVHD over &le;50 percent body surface area without liver or gastrointestinal tract involvement. All other manifestations of acute GVHD and more severe cutaneous disease are considered grade II or higher. Patients with grade II or higher acute GVHD are treated with glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>). Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a>, a non-absorbable glucocorticoid, is added for most patients with gastrointestinal involvement. Oral beclomethasone should not be administered if a gastrointestinal infection, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, is suspected. Topical steroids can be added for further control of cutaneous lesions. In addition, the prophylactic regimen should be optimized to ensure a therapeutic level. (See <a href=\"#H11942156\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing prophylactic agents'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent adults&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Studies evaluating the addition of other agents to glucocorticoids have had mixed results. The largest was a randomized phase II trial that evaluated the relative effectiveness of glucocorticoids plus one of four agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, denileukin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a>) for the initial treatment of acute GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, a multicenter, randomized, double blind, phase III trial comparing glucocorticoids to glucocorticoids plus mycophenolate was closed early due to futility (CTN 0802, NCT01002742). Therefore, although mycophenolate appeared promising, corticosteroids remain as the standard initial treatment for clinically significant acute GVHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263511844\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are the standard initial therapy for patients with grade II or higher acute GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The most commonly used glucocorticoid is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>. Although different doses and schedules have been used, the most widely used is methylprednisolone 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in divided doses. Steroids are continued for several weeks in responders and then gradually tapered over a period of several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Gradual tapering is important to prevent a flare of GVHD. Patients who demonstrate progression of disease by day 5 or nonresponse by day 7 are considered to have corticosteroid resistance. Treatment of acute GVHD with glucocorticoids results in complete response rates ranging from 25 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p>A variety of different glucocorticoid regimens have been evaluated for the management of acute GVHD. Initial studies used high doses (eg, 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> of intravenous bolus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These studies showed a high response rate, but were complicated by opportunistic infections, interstitial pneumonitis, and recrudescence of GVHD with dose reduction. Subsequent studies evaluating more moderate doses of methylprednisolone (1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> reported good response rates overall, but poor outcomes for those with severe GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>In an attempt to compare these different approaches, a multicenter trial randomly assigned 95 patients with acute GVHD to receive early treatment with either low (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or high (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. On day five of therapy, almost one-half of patients in the low dose group were switched to a higher dose because of lack of response or progression. With this strategy, there were no differences in mean response rates or actuarial survival at three years (63 versus 62 percent).</p><p>It is unknown whether even lower doses can be used for less severe GVHD (eg, grade II). A retrospective study analyzed transplant outcomes among 733 patients who received initial treatment for acute GVHD with either standard dose (prednisone-equivalent dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or low dose (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It was concluded that initial treatment with low dose glucocorticoids for patients with grades I to II acute GVHD did not compromise disease control or mortality and was associated with decreased length of hospitalization, as well as reductions in the incidence of invasive fungal infection and Gram-negative bacteremia.</p><p>However, this was a retrospective study and the reasons why certain patients began at a lower glucocorticoid dose compared with others likely reflect many different aspects of their GVHD, including physician preference as well as the pace of onset of signs and symptoms. A subsequent prospective, randomized trial comparing 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> versus 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in 150 patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD did not show any difference in non-relapse mortality, relapse, overall survival or toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A lack of difference may have been due to the rapid taper of steroids in those responding to standard dose steroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943617\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal tract-directed therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute GVHD frequently involves both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal involvement usually presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain, but may also manifest as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Confirmation of the diagnosis is recommended by pathologic evaluation of tissue obtained by upper endoscopy, rectal biopsy or colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal tract'</a>.)</p><p>Diarrhea and intestinal inflammation after allogeneic HCT can be caused by pathogenic bacteria and viruses or by GVHD. Bacterial cultures, viral polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assays, and histologic analyses of intestinal biopsy specimens are imperfect at distinguishing infection from GVHD, in part because the list of potential gut pathogens after transplantation is incomplete. Further, it is relatively common for patients to have both GVHD and viral infection (eg, CMV colitis).

The more recent patients transplanted with cyclosporine-based prophylactic regimens who developed GVHD did not respond as well to the various treatments.</p><p>The report from the Seattle group was a retrospective analysis of 427 patients who did not have a durable response to primary therapy for acute GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The most common manifestations were rash (75 percent), liver disease (59 percent), and gastrointestinal dysfunction (53 percent). Secondary treatments consisted of glucocorticoids in the majority of the patients (n = 249), ATG (n = 214), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (n = 80), or a monoclonal antibody (n = 19).
