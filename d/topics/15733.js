The most common causes of radiologically evident renal cysts in adults are simple renal cysts, which will be discussed in this topic review; autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD); and acquired cystic disease in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after several years of dialysis, particularly hemodialysis.

Simple renal cysts are commonly observed in normal kidneys, with an increasing incidence as individuals age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They are benign, asymptomatic lesions that rarely require treatment. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Simple renal cysts'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary clinical concern is accurately distinguishing simple renal cysts from complex renal cysts that are associated with an increased risk of malignancy. This increase in risk is primarily seen in categories III and IV in the Bosniak classification. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Bosniak classification of renal cysts'</a> below.)</p><p>Based upon the initial radiographic evaluation, further study may or may not be required, and some complex lesions that cannot be characterized noninvasively may require careful follow-up imaging, biopsy, or surgical excision for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BOSNIAK CLASSIFICATION OF RENAL CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidental finding of lesions in the renal parenchyma is common with the increased use of imaging procedures such as ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT). Such lesions are usually simple benign renal cysts, although complex renal cysts or neoplasms may need to be excluded. If the lesion appears to be a simple renal cyst, additional imaging is unnecessary. However, should the lesion appear to be other than a simple cyst, additional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT scan is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>The Bosniak renal cyst classification system was created to help diagnose and manage these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Based upon the morphologic and enhancement characteristics with pre- and post-contrast CT scanning, cystic renal masses are placed into one of five different categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67087 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Category I</strong> &ndash; A benign simple renal cyst or multiple renal cysts, each with a thin wall without septa, calcifications, or solid components. The cyst has the density of water and does not enhance. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Simple renal cysts'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Category II</strong> &ndash; Benign cystic lesions in which there may be a few thin septa and the wall or septa may contain fine calcifications or a short segment of slightly thickened calcification. This category also includes uniformly high-attenuation lesions that are &lt;3 cm in diameter, well marginated, and nonenhancing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100055\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100055 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Category IIF</strong> &ndash; Cysts in this category are generally well marginated and are more complicated than category II cysts but less complicated than category III cysts. They may have multiple thin septa or minimal smooth thickening of the septa or wall, which may contain calcification that may also be thick and nodular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is no measurable contrast enhancement. However, these lesions may have perceived enhancement of the septa or wall, which is due to subjective (and not measurable) enhancement when the unenhanced and contrast-enhanced images are compared. This category also includes totally intrarenal, nonenhancing, high-attenuating lesions that are &gt;3 cm in diameter. These cysts require follow-up to ascertain that they are not malignant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Category III</strong> &ndash; Indeterminate cystic masses that have thickened, irregular or smooth walls or septa. Measurable enhancement is present. Approximately 40 to 60 percent are malignant (cystic renal cell carcinoma and multiloculated cystic renal cell carcinoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The remaining lesions are benign and include hemorrhagic cysts, chronic infected cysts, and multiloculated cystic nephroma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Category IV</strong> &ndash; Category IV lesions (85 to 100 percent of which have been reported to be malignant in various studies) have all the characteristics of category III cysts, plus they contain enhancing soft-tissue components that are adjacent to and independent of the wall or septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77721\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77721 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p>The presence of true contrast enhancement of the lesion (a minimum increased attenuation of 10 to 15 Hounsfield units) is the most important characteristic separating categories III and IV, which, as noted above, are associated with malignancy in 40 to 100 percent of reported cases, from the categories I, II, and IIF, which are typically benign processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT BY BOSNIAK CATEGORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial imaging study that detects such a cyst is commonly ultrasonography. If basic ultrasonography criteria for a benign simple renal cyst are met, further study is not required. The following is a general approach to the management of patients with renal cystic lesions based upon the Bosniak category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Category I and II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further evaluation of Bosniak category I and II lesions is generally not required, although a repeat ultrasonography may be done at 6 to 12 months in selected patients in order to confirm stability and a correct diagnosis. In addition, follow-up imaging is necessary if the clinician is unable to distinguish between a category II and IIF cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Category IIF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to renal cystic lesions with indeterminate findings on ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scanning is uncertain. These lesions are usually Bosniak category IIF or III, as defined above (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Bosniak classification of renal cysts'</a> above). However, some category II lesions will be included in this category based on the quality of the CT scan and the expertise of the radiologist; marked interobserver variation has also been noted when attempting to identify category II lesions that can be safely monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>With category IIF lesions, we recommend making every attempt to obtain prior studies for purposes of comparison. If such studies are not available, many radiologists would recommend an additional imaging study (typically good-quality contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for further characterization. If the radiologist is unable to clearly distinguish a category IIF from a III lesion, the lesion should be placed into the higher category. The approach to category III lesions is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H499148316\" class=\"local\">'Category III'</a> below.)</p><p>Most category IIF cysts require follow-up imaging (hence the &quot;F&quot;) to document stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The absence of change supports benign disease, while progression suggests a neoplastic process, as illustrated by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 42 patients with category IIF lesions who had follow-up CT examinations for two or more years (average 5.8 years), two lesions became more complex with thicker septa; both were found to be cystic neoplasms at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This strategy prevented unnecessary surgery in the remaining 42 patients (95 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of malignancy in category IIF cysts appears to be higher in lesions that require resection. In one study that included 62 patients with category IIF lesions, 16 lesions in 13 patients were resected for various reasons (six patients had a coexisting category IV lesion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a solid renal mass, three had a history of primary renal malignancy, two had an ipsilateral category III lesion, three patients requested definitive surgery, and two had recurrent cysts after aspiration and suspicion for malignancy by the urologist). Among 16 resected lesions, four (25 percent) were malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other risk factors for malignancy included a prior history of renal malignancy, a coexisting stage IV lesion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a solid renal mass.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499148316\"><span class=\"h2\">Category III</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to category III lesions varies among clinicians. Options available include continued surveillance with periodic imaging, fine-needle biopsy, or surgery with partial nephrectomy, if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The decision as to which avenue to pursue generally depends upon the appearance of the lesion and the comorbidities of the patient. In general, among patients who are good surgical candidates, surgery is preferred. For patients who are not good surgical candidates or who elect surveillance, we obtain a CT or MRI at six months, with follow-up imaging with either a CT or ultrasounds yearly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/3-6,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,10-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is typically used to evaluate patients with indeterminate lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. In addition to signal characteristics, MRI evaluates the same morphologic findings as described for CT scanning: wall thickening, nodularity, septa, and enhancement. One difference is that MRI does <strong>not</strong> detect calcification. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Bosniak classification of renal cysts'</a> above.)</p><p>MRI is most useful for characterizing the internal contents of cysts, such as hemorrhage or mucin, and is more sensitive than both ultrasonography and CT scanning in showing enhancement of internal septations.</p><p>The potential value of this approach was illustrated in a series of 37 patients with 55 complex cystic renal lesions who underwent T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The following frequencies of malignancy were noted with specific radiographic abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>22 percent of 37 lesions that contained fluid of heterogeneous signal intensity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>44 percent of 32 lesions with intense mural (ie, cyst wall) enhancement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>63 percent of 16 lesions with mural irregularity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>71 percent of 14 lesions with a thick wall (&gt;2 mm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>75 percent of four lesions with mural masses or nodules and 50 percent of four lesions with septa</p><p/><p>The combination of mural irregularity and intense mural enhancement had the highest correlation with malignancy.</p><p>Serial MRI examinations at 3, 6, and 12 months are warranted in patients with indeterminate lesions on gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Further imaging is generally not necessary to follow up lesions that are stable at 12 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous needle biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative needle biopsy has generally <strong>not</strong> been recommended for resectable renal lesions, because of concern about seeding of the peritoneum. However, biopsy is required prior to percutaneous cryoablation of renal masses. The evaluation of solid renal masses is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of percutaneous needle biopsy in evaluating an indeterminate renal mass or cyst is likely to grow since such masses are increasingly being identified with the widespread use of CT and MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In patients with indeterminate imaging studies, percutaneous, image-guided renal biopsy appears to be safe and can provide a diagnosis in up to 80 percent cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/4,7,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,14-16</a>]. The following findings are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report evaluated 28 patients with a complex cystic renal mass on CT scan who underwent image-guided biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Seventeen patients (61 percent) had a malignant lesion (16 renal cell carcinoma, 1 lymphoma), and 11 had benign disease (six hemorrhagic cysts, three inflammatory cysts, one metanephric adenoma, and one cystic oncocytoma). The biopsy diagnosis was confirmed in all 17 patients who underwent surgical resection. There was <strong>no</strong> interval radiologic change at a minimum of one year in the 10 patients with benign lesions who did not undergo surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study evaluated 583 patients in whom image-guided biopsy was performed for renal mass lesions that were classified as indeterminate by imaging (7.2 percent of renal masses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the 517 patients in whom follow-up was available, a diagnosis was established in 76 percent, with a malignant lesion found in 44 percent. A biopsy diagnosis could not be established with acceptable confidence in 21 percent, and a false diagnosis was made in 1.2 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Category IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Category IV lesions <strong>require surgery</strong> since approximately 85 to 100 percent are malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults/abstract/2,3,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SIMPLE RENAL CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple renal cysts are frequently observed in normal kidneys.

Cyst formation was twice as likely in men compared with women, and a sevenfold increase in prevalence was noted from the fourth to the eighth decade of life (5 to 36 percent).

Based upon morphologic and enhancement characteristics with pre- and post-contrast computed tomography (CT) scanning, cystic renal masses are placed into one of five different categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67087 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Bosniak classification of renal cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of renal cystic lesions is based upon initial classification according to the Bosniak system:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Further evaluation of Bosniak category I and II lesions is not required. If the clinician is unable to distinguish between a category II and IIF cyst, follow-up imaging should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Category I and II'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For category IIF lesions, we recommend making every attempt to obtain prior studies for purposes of comparison. If such studies are unavailable, we recommend an additional imaging study, such as a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for further characterization. If the radiologist is unable to clearly distinguish a category IIF from a III lesion, the lesion should be treated like a category III lesion. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Category IIF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For category III lesions, we recommend obtaining prior studies for comparison. If such studies are unavailable, we recommend another imaging study, such as a contrast-enhanced MRI, for further characterization. The approach to lesions that are still indeterminate varies among clinicians. Options available include continued surveillance with periodic imaging, fine-needle biopsy, or surgery with partial nephrectomy. Most category III lesions are either removed or closely followed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Category IIF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Category IV lesions require surgery, with approximately 85 to 100 percent being malignant.

They are the most common renal masses, accounting for roughly 65 to 70 percent of cases. The prevalence of simple renal cysts varies with the population studied and the imaging modality utilized. These cysts most often occur in patients &gt;50 years of age.

If basic ultrasonography criteria for a benign simple renal cyst are met, further study is not required. A CT scan should be performed if the ultrasonogram is equivocal, if calcifications or septae are seen, or if multiple cysts are clustered in a pattern that could mask an underlying carcinoma.
