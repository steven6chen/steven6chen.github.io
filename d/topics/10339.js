By definition, vasculitis affecting other organ systems must be absent. CSVV may develop in association with a wide variety of factors, including drugs, infections, systemic disease, or malignancy. An inciting factor is not detected in around one-third to one-half of patients. Such patients are designated here as having idiopathic CSVV.</p><p>Idiopathic CSVV often resolves within a few weeks, and thus, the management of most patients involves confirming the lack of an identifiable cause and the alleviation of symptoms. Systemic immunomodulatory therapy to arrest the disease process is usually reserved for the subset of patients who develop complications such as hemorrhagic bullae, ulceration, or chronic or recurrent disease.</p><p>The management of patients with idiopathic CSVV will be reviewed here. The evaluation of patients with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis, and the clinical features and treatment of specific disorders that may present with vasculitis involving small vessels of the skin are discussed separately.

The term hypersensitivity vasculitis has also been used to refer to CSVV, but is most appropriately applied to CSVV caused by a known drug or infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis#H606309\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The 2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature classifies CSVV as a single-organ vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H364697\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) is characterized by the presence of cutaneous lesions in conjunction with histopathologic evidence for a leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving the capillaries, venules, and arterioles in the skin. Although palpable purpura are the most common associated skin manifestations, other lesions such as petechiae, hemorrhagic bullae, ulcers, and urticaria may also develop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F77522%7EDERM%2F56272%7EDERM%2F70300%7EDERM%2F65932%7EDERM%2F58626%7EDERM%2F57440%7EDERM%2F77723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77522 graphicRef56272 graphicRef70300 graphicRef65932 graphicRef58626 graphicRef57440 graphicRef77723 \">picture 1A-G</a>). The skin lesions are often most prevalent on the lower legs and other dependent areas. </p><p>A wide variety of factors can induce CSVV, including drugs, infections, systemic diseases, malignancy, and rarely dietary factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Idiopathic CSVV, which accounts for 30 to 60 percent of cases, is a diagnosis of exclusion that can only be made when clinical and laboratory investigations fail to yield both an underlying cause and the presence of systemic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The performance of a conscientious search for an inciting factor is important because removal of the underlying cause may result in the resolution of CSVV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In addition, systemic involvement should be excluded prior to making this diagnosis since a more aggressive approach to therapy is usually indicated in patients with internal disease. </p><p>The clinical and pathologic findings of cutaneous vasculitis, the evaluation for an etiologic agent, and the assessment of the extent of disease in patients with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis#H16171984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of idiopathic urticarial vasculitis, a type of CSVV that presents with persistent urticarial skin lesions, are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urticarial-vasculitis#H43\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urticarial vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15696119\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients with cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV), the condition is self-limited, and spontaneously resolves within two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In patients with self-limited disease, new lesion formation usually continues to occur during the first one to two weeks of the disease process. Chronic or recurrent disease occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2,3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8</a>].</p><p>Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and red-brown hemosiderin deposits in the skin that are secondary to the breakdown of extravasated erythrocytes commonly remain after an episode of CSVV. These lesions tend to resolve slowly over time; several months or more may be required for resolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368147\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of idiopathic cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) influences the approach to treatment. The management of patients with acute disease differs from those with chronic or recurrent lesions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368515\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute and uncomplicated idiopathic CSVV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the high likelihood for spontaneous resolution, treatment to suppress the vasculitic process is not necessary in patients who present with only acute palpable purpura or petechiae. However, some of these patients experience bothersome pruritus, pain, or local edema, and may benefit from interventions that improve these symptoms.</p><p>Clinical experience suggests that the following measures can be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rest, leg elevation, and compression stockings </strong>&ndash; Disease may be exacerbated by exercise or prolonged maintenance of affected areas in dependent positions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Leg elevation and use of compression stockings may decrease immune complex deposition in the lower extremities, thereby decreasing the progression of vasculitic skin lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong> &ndash; NSAIDs may be useful for pain management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral antihistamines </strong>&ndash; Antihistamines may help to suppress pruritus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25558627\"><span class=\"h2\">Complicated or chronic idiopathic CSVV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although measures to improve symptoms can be beneficial for all patients, treatment aimed at arresting the disease process is indicated in patients with idiopathic CSVV complicated by the presence of hemorrhagic blisters, cutaneous necrosis, or ulceration, as these manifestations may lead to secondary infections, chronic wounds, and scarring. Patients with chronic CSVV (active disease that persists for more than four weeks) or recurring disease are also candidates for therapeutic intervention. When chronic or recurrent disease is asymptomatic and patients are not bothered by the appearance of skin lesions, deferring treatment is an additional option.</p><p>Much of the data used to guide the approach to treatment of idiopathic CSVV are derived from case reports and small case series of patients with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis associated with a predisposing factor, with or without concomitant extracutaneous disease. The paucity of data on the efficacy of treatments precludes definitive conclusions on the efficacy of any specific therapy.</p><p>Systemic immunomodulatory drugs are the mainstays of treatment for patients with complicated or chronic idiopathic CSVV. Our approach to these patients involves the initial use of a short course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in an attempt to abruptly suppress the disease process, followed by the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> in patients who continue to have active disease. If the response to this regimen is inadequate, we consider the use of more aggressive immunosuppressive agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132405\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58265601\"><span class=\"h4\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic glucocorticoids are the most commonly utilized agents for the management of acute, single episodes of CSVV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. No randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in CSVV, and the use of these agents is primarily based upon reports of efficacy from small series of patients with various forms of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-11</a>]. In our experience, the vast majority of patients with idiopathic CSVV improve during therapy. </p><p>We typically initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of ideal body weight until new lesion formation ceases (usually one to two weeks). This is followed by a taper to treatment cessation over the course of three to six weeks. Improvement is often detectable within one week after starting therapy. </p><p>For patients in whom disease recurs upon tapering or discontinuation of a course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, continuation of long-term monotherapy with glucocorticoids is not recommended due to the risk for drug-related side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Rather, such patients should be transitioned to glucocorticoid-sparing medications (see <a href=\"#H1132420\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> below). If significant morbidity is likely to result from a disease flare, we continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at the lowest effective dose until the onset of action of the glucocorticoid-sparing agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132420\"><span class=\"h3\">Second-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, patients who relapse after an initial course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, both of which are inhibitors of neutrophil function. Although the data to support the efficacy of these therapies are limited, a trial of these agents is reasonable prior to the use of more aggressive immunosuppressive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1132622\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> below.) </p><p>In our experience, both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> therapy are useful for decreasing the reliance on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in the majority of treated patients. We usually attempt treatment with colchicine first, due to the broader range of adverse effects associated with dapsone therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25558641\"><span class=\"h4\">Colchicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data conflict on the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in CSVV. An unblinded randomized trial in which 41 patients with histopathologically confirmed cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (either idiopathic or associated with a predisposing factor) were treated for at least one month with either colchicine alone (0.5 mg twice daily) or topical emollients found no significant difference in efficacy between the two treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The study included 16 patients who had been treated with other agents with variable responses, suggesting that an unspecified proportion of patients may have had refractory disease. </p><p>In contrast to the randomized trial, case series and case reports have suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> therapy can be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/4,10,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,18-21</a>]. In one series, seven out of nine patients with chronic biopsy-proven leukocytoclastic vasculitis who demonstrated improvement during treatment with colchicine had disease flares upon discontinuation of the drug and recurrent improvement with drug reinitiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> for CSVV is usually given as a 0.6 mg dose twice daily. Initial signs of response are typically observed within one to two weeks. If no response is noted after one week, increasing the dose to 0.6 mg three times per day may be attempted. However, drug-related gastrointestinal adverse effects such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain often limit dose escalation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25558648\"><span class=\"h4\">Dapsone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data in support of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> use are limited to case reports in patients with various forms of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/22-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-30</a>]. As with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, there are reports in which disease improved during treatment and recurred upon the discontinuation of dapsone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Doses of 50 to 150 mg per day are typically utilized for CSVV, and signs of improvement are often noted as early as one week after the initiation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Clinicians who prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> must remain cognizant of the drug's potential adverse effects. Hemolytic anemia is a common consequence of treatment that occurs in all patients with varying severity, and close monitoring of hematologic status, especially early in the course of therapy, is essential. In particular, dapsone therapy should be avoided in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due to a high risk for severe hemolytic anemia. Other potential adverse effects of dapsone include idiosyncratic agranulocytosis, a hypersensitivity syndrome, hepatitis, and peripheral motor neuropathy. </p><p>If baseline laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel to assess liver and renal function, and a G6PD assay are within normal limits, we typically begin treatment with 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> per day. Standard monitoring recommendations include a complete blood count once weekly during the first month of therapy and periodic monitoring of liver function tests. Obtaining complete blood counts and liver function tests every other week during the first month of therapy has seemed sufficient in the author's practice. Provided the drug dose remains stable, the frequency of these studies can then be reduced to once monthly for three to four months, followed by once every three to four months.</p><p>For patients who fail to exhibit signs of improvement after two weeks at 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> per day, we increase the daily dose to 150 mg. If the response to 150 mg per day of dapsone is unsatisfactory, we initiate a trial of combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> or switch to an alternative therapy. The addition of pentoxifylline (400 mg three times daily) to dapsone (100 mg per day) was associated with improvement of dapsone-resistant cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis related to rheumatoid arthritis and urticarial vasculitis in two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, additional studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of the dapsone-pentoxifylline combination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132622\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When disease persists despite a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, we consider the initiation of more aggressive systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

We typically attempt to discontinue therapy once existing lesions have healed and no new lesions have developed for two to three months. If lesions recur, treatment is reinitiated. The optimal regimen for discontinuing therapy in idiopathic CSVV is unknown; we typically decrease the dose of medication over the course of a few weeks and monitor for disease flares prior to complete drug cessation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294555\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) is a vasculitic disorder characterized by involvement limited to the skin. Idiopathic CSVV, which accounts for 30 to 60 percent of cases, is a diagnosis of exclusion. (See <a href=\"#H25558599\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H364697\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, idiopathic CSVV resolves spontaneously within a few weeks, negating the need for treatment to stop the disease process. Treatment in patients with acute, uncomplicated disease is directed towards the alleviation of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H368515\" class=\"local\">'Acute and uncomplicated idiopathic CSVV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with idiopathic CSVV complicated by hemorrhagic blister or ulcer formation are candidates for therapeutic intervention to arrest disease activity. Such treatment is also appropriate in patients with chronic (lasting more than four weeks) or recurrent CSVV. (See <a href=\"#H25558627\" class=\"local\">'Complicated or chronic idiopathic CSVV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic immunomodulatory therapies are utilized for the treatment of patients with symptomatic complicated, chronic, or recurrent CSVV. We suggest a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> taper given over the course of three to six weeks as the initial course of therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25558627\" class=\"local\">'Complicated or chronic idiopathic CSVV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who experience relapses upon tapering or discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, we suggest the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> to reduce the risk for glucocorticoid-related adverse effects (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). More aggressive immunosuppressive therapy may be beneficial in patients who fail to respond to these agents.
