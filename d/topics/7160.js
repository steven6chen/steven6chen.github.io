You might get slightly different numbers depending on how you take your child's temperature &ndash; oral (mouth), armpit, ear, forehead, or rectal.</p><p>Armpit, ear, and forehead temperatures are easier to measure than rectal or oral temperatures, but they are not as accurate. Even so, the height of the temperature is less important than how sick your child seems to you. If you think your child has a fever, and he or she seems sick, your child's doctor or nurse might want you to double-check the temperature with an oral or rectal reading.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387365139\"><span class=\"h1\">What is the best way to take my child's temperature?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most accurate way is to take a rectal temperature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74460 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Oral temperatures are also reliable when done in children who are least 4 years old. Here is the right way to take a temperature by mouth:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wait at least 30 minutes after your child has drunk or eaten anything hot or cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash the thermometer with cool water and soap. Then rinse it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the tip of the thermometer under your child's tongue toward the back. Ask your child to hold the thermometer with his or her lips, not teeth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child keep his or her lips sealed around the thermometer. A glass thermometer takes about 3 minutes to work. Most digital thermometers take less than 1 minute.</p><p/><p>Armpit, ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61085\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61085 \">figure 2</a>), and forehead temperatures are not as accurate as rectal or oral temperatures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387365146\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of fever in children is infection. For example, children can get a fever if they have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cold or the flu</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An airway infection, such as croup or bronchiolitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stomach bug</p><p/><p>In some cases, children get a fever after getting a vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387365153\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take my child to see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should take your child to a doctor or nurse if he or she is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger than 3 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C) or higher. Your infant should see a doctor or nurse even if he or she looks normal or seems fine. Do not give fever medicines to an infant younger than 3 months unless a doctor or nurse tells you to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 3 and 36 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C) or higher for more than 3 days. Go right away if your child seems sick or is fussy, clingy, or refuses to drink fluids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 3 and 36 months old and has a rectal temperature of 102&ordm;F (38.9&ordm;C) or higher.</p><p/><p>Children of any age should also see a doctor or nurse if they have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral, rectal, ear, or forehead temperature of 104&ordm;F (40&ordm;C) or higher</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Armpit temperature of 103&ordm;F (39.4&ordm;C) or higher</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A seizure caused by a fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fevers that keep coming back (even if they last only a few hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever as well as an ongoing medical problem, such as heart disease, cancer, lupus, or sickle cell anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever as well as a new skin rash</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387365160\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer your child lots of fluids to drink. Call the doctor or nurse if your child won't or can't drink fluids for more than a few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage your child to rest as much as he or she wants. But don't force your child to sleep or rest. (Your child can go back to school or regular activities after he or she has had a normal temperature for 24 hours.)</p><p/><p>Some parents give their children sponge baths to cool them down, but that is not usually necessary. Sometimes people think they can cool a child down by putting rubbing alcohol on their skin or adding it to a bath. But this is <strong>dangerous</strong>. Do not use any kind of alcohol to try to treat a fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387365167\"><span class=\"h1\">How are fevers treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing the fever. Many children do not need treatment. Those who do might need:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics to fight the infection causing the fever. But antibiotics work only on infections caused by bacteria, not on infections caused by viruses. For example, antibiotics will <strong>not</strong> work on a cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can help bring down a fever. But these medicines are not always necessary. For instance, a child older than 3 months who has a temperature of less than 102&ordm;F (38.9&ordm;C), and who is otherwise healthy and acting normally, does not need treatment.</p><p/><p>If you do not know how best to handle your child's fever, call his or her nurse or doctor.</p><p><strong>Never</strong> give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to a child younger than 18 years old. Aspirin can cause a dangerous condition called Reye syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387365174\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
