In PM, the muscles get inflamed. Doctors don't know what causes PM.</p><p>PM is more common in adults, but it can also happen in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20048718\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of polymyositis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PM causes muscle weakness. The weakness affects both sides of the body and usually happens slowly over time. It involves muscles closest to the trunk of the body, such as those in the neck, shoulders, hips, and thighs. Depending on the muscles involved, people with PM can have trouble climbing stairs, lifting things above their head, or swallowing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20048733\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for polymyositis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will order one or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography, or &quot;EMG&quot; &ndash; This test shows whether your muscles are responding to the nerves' electrical signals in the correct way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle biopsy &ndash; For this test, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from a muscle that is weak. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test called an MRI scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20048748\"><span class=\"h1\">How is polymyositis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for PM includes medicines called steroids. Steroids help reduce inflammation. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p>People with PM usually need to take steroids for a long time. But steroids have side effects of their own. They can make your bones weak and raise your chances of getting an infection. To avoid these side effects as much as possible, your doctor will slowly lower (or &quot;taper&quot;) your dose over time.</p><p>If you can't take steroids, the steroids don't help enough, or your symptoms come back, your doctor can treat you with other medicines. These medicines help reduce inflammation, too, but are different than steroids. Sometimes, doctors prescribe both steroids and these other medicines at the same time to treat PM.</p><p>In children, long-term use of steroids can slow normal growth. To help prevent this side effect, doctors usually prescribe steroids along with other medicines to children. That way, the children can take less of the steroids and have a better chance of growing normally.</p><p>Other treatment for PM involves keeping your body as strong as possible and preventing further problems. This usually includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working with a physical therapist (exercise expert) to learn exercises to strengthen your muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing what and how you eat, if you have trouble swallowing or choke easily on your food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines to help prevent side effects from the steroids</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20048763\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she will work with you to get your PM under control before you try to get pregnant. Plus, he or she will make sure your medicines are safe to take during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20048778\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your individual situation. Some people with PM have only mild symptoms. But many people have more bothersome symptoms that last years.</p><p>PM can also cause other types of long-term medical problems. These include lung and heart problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20048793\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatomyositis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dermatomyositis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyositis-dermatomyositis-and-other-forms-of-idiopathic-inflammatory-myopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and other forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
