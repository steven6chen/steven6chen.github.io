Although the duration of seizures used to define status has varied over time, an accepted definition for the purposes of clinical practice defines SE as a single unremitting seizure lasting longer than five minutes or frequent clinical seizures without an interictal return to the baseline clinical state. This corresponds with the time at which urgent treatment should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-complications-of-status-epilepticus-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and complications of status epilepticus in children&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p>The management of SE in children is reviewed here. The definition, pathophysiology, risk factors, and outcome of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-complications-of-status-epilepticus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and complications of status epilepticus in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18019579\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of the patient's previous response to antiseizure drugs and current medication use may guide approach to management. In deciding initial therapy, the following issues should be considered:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18019585\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child has a history of previous status epilepticus (SE), knowing which antiseizure drug was effective in arresting the seizures is helpful. If the child did not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fosphenytoin</a>, for example, another drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> or valproic acid (VPA), would be preferable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18019591\"><span class=\"h2\">Missed medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child is on long-term antiseizure drug therapy, it should be determined whether medication has been recently missed or if prescriptions have not been refilled. Antiseizure drug levels obtained upon admission may not be available for many hours and initial treatment decisions may be made without them. If, for example, VPA has provided good seizure control, and the child is known to have missed one or more doses, intravenous VPA, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, should be considered as initial treatment.</p><p>Low antiseizure drug levels may contribute to SE in up to one third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one series of 51 children with SE, at least one or all antiseizure drug levels were therapeutic in 82 and 66 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition to nonadherence, there are a number of other clinical scenarios that may lead to an unexpectedly low serum level of an antiseizure drug. These include medical conditions such as vomiting or malabsorption and administration of concomitant medications that may increase clearance of a particular antiseizure drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18019597\"><span class=\"h2\">Paradoxical effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiseizure drugs can paradoxically trigger SE, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiseizure drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiagabine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tiagabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vigabatrin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vigabatrin</a>, can precipitate generalized convulsive SE, particularly the myoclonic type, as well as nonconvulsive (absence) SE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a> may worsen myoclonic seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> may worsen complex partial seizures and increase generalized tonic-clonic seizures at high serum levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Carbamazepine</a> is known to precipitate drop attacks, often with atypical absence seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a> may worsen seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome.

If a new antiseizure drug has been added or the dose has been increased in the previous months, the drug may be causing seizures and should not be used in an attempt to control SE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18019603\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonprescription medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonprescription medications, including over-the-counter drugs, illicit substances, and, rarely, herbal preparations, can precipitate seizures. Specific questioning is usually required to ascertain use of these substances, especially illicit drug use.</p><p>Some antiseizure drugs commonly used to treat SE may worsen seizures caused by illicit drugs. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> could worsen the toxicity of cocaine, as both block sodium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18019609\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative routes of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of an intravenous catheter may be difficult in some patients. If intravenous (IV) access is delayed or impossible, many antiseizure drugs can be given by alternative routes. Examples include buccal and intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a>, rectal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a>, and intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fosphenytoin</a> and benzodiazepines, all of which are safe, well tolerated, and absorbed quickly. However, if intravenous access is available, drugs administered by this route are more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Emergency departments that follow strict protocols for management of seizures may emphasize IV therapy, which is unnecessary in many children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Repeated bolus infusions of benzodiazepines and barbiturates often lead to respiratory depression, endotracheal intubation, and hospitalization. In one study, the risk of respiratory depression increased when more than two doses of benzodiazepines were administered, including doses administered in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Treatment with oral or intramuscular medication may be considered if the seizures are not generalized convulsive (tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic), have stopped before the child arrives in the emergency department, are short in duration, or the child is conscious despite multiple seizures. Oral loading with the commonly used antiseizure drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxcarbazepine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levetiracetam</a>) reduces the risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p>The missed opportunity to take this more conservative approach was illustrated by a retrospective series that examined antiseizure drug use in a university hospital emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of 55 adolescent and adult patients treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fosphenytoin</a>, 45 percent could have been loaded orally with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> because they were awake on arrival, alert, had no emesis, and did not have repeated seizures or SE or require endotracheal intubation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18019615\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are usually dramatic behavioral events in a conscious individual that are often misdiagnosed as epileptic seizures and are sometimes treated with large doses of antiseizure drugs. The history and presentation may provide clues to diagnosis. PNES typically occur in teenage patients with affective or anxiety disorders and a family history of seizures may be present. Many patients who have PNES also have, or have had, epileptic seizures, so a past medical history of PNES should not be used to rule out the possibility of epileptic status.</p><p>PNES can be distinguished from SE by an EEG. An urgent EEG should be obtained when PNES are suspect. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> below.) Therapy may need to be initiated before an EEG can be obtained. In this case, sedating medication should be avoided if possible. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fosphenytoin</a> or VPA are reasonable alternatives to benzodiazepines in this setting.</p><p>PNES and other nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders are discussed in detail separately.

An adequate airway should be established immediately if there is respiratory compromise, and supportive therapy (eg, oxygen, mechanical ventilation) should be instituted as needed. A secure intravenous catheter should be placed for sampling of blood and administration of medications. Ongoing monitoring of vital signs should be initiated.</p><p>A rapid neurologic examination should then be performed to provide a preliminary classification of the type of status epilepticus (SE). A history obtained from a parent or caregiver may help to determine the cause or precipitants of the seizures.

While the yield of other testing was relatively low (3.6 percent had evidence of toxin ingestion, and 6 percent had abnormal electrolyte or glucose levels), such findings impact management strategies and outcomes, and these tests are also recommended.</p><p>Other testing in specific clinical circumstances may include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69291 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood cultures and lumbar puncture (LP) should be obtained if there is evidence of systemic or central nervous system infection; there are insufficient data to support these tests being routine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic studies for inborn errors of metabolism should be considered if there are other suggestive indicators.

However, if LP is considered, computed tomography (CT) is generally recommended beforehand to exclude a mass lesion, especially in a patient with focal neurologic signs. Later, a magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI) is recommended if the etiology of SE is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac monitoring, frequent measurement of blood pressure, and pulse oximetry should be instituted. In general, status epilepticus does not independently cause systemic hypotension, although many of the drugs used to treat it do. The presence of low blood pressure should prompt consideration of an underlying systemic illness or infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of an adequate airway and normal gas exchange is a priority to avoid the consequences of hypoxemia. It requires continued assessment and intervention as needed. Respiratory failure can result from continuing seizures or respiratory depression from anticonvulsants.</p><p>Metabolic abnormalities should be corrected. Most children with acute seizures have elevated blood glucose levels that do not require treatment. However, nonketotic or ketotic hyperglycemia can occasionally precipitate SE and may be an early manifestation of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Hypoglycemia should be treated with 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose solution, except in patients on the ketogenic diet. Continued seizures, especially in the setting of hypoxemia, may lower brain glucose levels, worsening brain lactic acidosis and leading to further neuronal damage if prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

These children should be treated with glucose, not anticonvulsants. This situation emphasizes the importance of obtaining a rapid assessment of blood glucose in a child with seizures in order to provide appropriate therapy.</p><p>Metabolic acidosis often is present but usually resolves without treatment after the seizures are controlled. If the patient is febrile, antipyretics should be given.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When there is uncertainty regarding the presence of SE, an urgent electroencephalogram (EEG) should be obtained. In the emergency department, this can be a limited study, with application of only a few electrodes to determine if the background is consistent with a normal awake individual (ie, psychogenic nonepileptic seizure) or the diffusely slow and depressed background of SE. (See <a href=\"#H18019615\" class=\"local\">'Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures'</a> above.)</p><p>If an urgent EEG cannot be obtained, an EEG should be done to evaluate background activity as soon as possible after the seizure stops, ideally within one to two hours. The background usually remains abnormally slow for hours or even days after generalized convulsive or prolonged partial SE, but it is normal in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures unless large doses of sedating antiseizure drugs have been given. If the patient has not regained a relatively normal mental state within a few hours after SE has stopped, an EEG should be performed to evaluate the possibility of subclinical electrographic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Studies of critically ill children who undergo continuous EEG monitoring indicate that electrographic seizures are present in approximately 30 to 40 percent of recordings, often without clinical accompaniment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Similar findings have been reported in critically ill adults. The benefit of continuous EEG monitoring in unselected patients is unclear.

Finally, in an open-label, randomized trial of 40 patients with refractory SE, VPA appeared to stop seizures more quickly than diazepam infusion (median time 5 versus 17 minutes), and none of the VPA treated group required ventilation or developed hypotension, compared with 60 and 50 percent in the diazepam group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>VPA usually is well tolerated, even in clinically unstable patients, and is less sedating than barbiturates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children/abstract/13,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,42</a>].

The dose of midazolam was 5 mg for children whose weight was 13 to 40 kg and 10 mg in those over 40 kg. While lorazepam treatment was associated with a shorter median time from active treatment to cessation of convulsions (1.6 versus 3.3 minutes) among responders, this was offset in the prehospital setting by a longer median time to active treatment administration in the lorazepam group (4.8 versus 1.2 minutes) because of the need to place an IV catheter.

Close monitoring during this period is critical. The two most common reasons for delayed postictal recovery are sedation from medications and ongoing nonconvulsive seizures, and these two causes can be impossible to distinguish clinically. All children who do not return to a normal level of consciousness within a few hours after initial treatment of status epilepticus should therefore be monitored with electroencephalogram (EEG). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18022354\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the postictal recovery period it is also important to repeat a full neurological examination, looking for asymmetric or focal findings that may suggest clues to the underlying etiology. A neuroimaging study should be obtained when status epilepticus is the first presentation of epilepsy as well as in children whose recovery from SE does not follow the expected course. A lumbar puncture should be obtained if there is evidence of systemic or central nervous system infection, provided that the child&rsquo;s level of consciousness is appropriate and there are no other contraindications to immediate lumbar puncture.
