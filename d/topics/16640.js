Conservative treatment includes pain control and aggressive supportive pulmonary care primarily aimed at avoiding the need for intubation, which is associated with increased rates of pneumonia and death. For patients who continue to have acute pain and are experiencing worsening pulmonary function in spite of optimal management (eg, flail chest) or those with rib fractures that do not heal (nonunion) and are causing persistent pain and functional impairment, surgical rib stabilization (also known as osteosynthesis) may be needed. </p><p>The indications, preparation, technique for rib fracture stabilization, and outcomes are reviewed here. Initial management of traumatic rib fractures is reviewed elsewhere.

Bedside incentive spirometry can be used as a means to assess vital capacity and likelihood of respiratory failure, but there are no evidence-based guidelines that can be used to determine at what threshold patients should be considered candidates for operative rib fixation. Although the degree of displacement of rib fractures has been shown to correlate with opioid need and it is possible that operative rib fixation may be reduce use of analgesics, there are no studies that demonstrate a benefit to operative rib fixation for pain control alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Therefore, most surgeons recommend surgical stabilization as a means to avoid intubation in patients who are failing medical management or as a means to facilitate extubation in patients who are ventilator dependent due to chest wall instability or pain. </p><p>A survey of trauma and thoracic surgeons in the United States found that although the majority felt that rib fracture fixation was appropriate for selected patients, only 26 percent of surgeons who answered the survey had actually been involved in such a case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. National Trauma Data Bank results indicate that only 1 percent of patients with flail chest undergo operative fixation of the ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Reasons for this include lack of familiarity with the operation; lack of a uniform taxonomy that can be used to develop specific, evidence-based guidelines; and lack of specialty ownership of this disease process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4272881786\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no role for surgical stabilization for patients with severe pulmonary contusion as the cause for respiratory insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>].

For patients with flail chest, early operative treatment reduces pulmonary complications, facilitates ventilator weaning, and shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. However, patients with flail chest and associated significant pulmonary contusions are less likely to benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/8,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20-22</a>]. Patients with severe rib fractures but without flail chest may also benefit if the rib fractures result in actual or impending respiratory failure due to pain or severe chest wall deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other patient subgroups may also benefit from surgical stabilization, but it must be understood that recommendations for surgical stabilization are made in the absence of trials comparing operative repair with contemporary nonoperative escalating treatment strategies that include aggressive pain management chest physiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2625574131\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p>Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including a review of 22 studies including 988 patients published by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], have found improved pulmonary outcomes for patients undergoing surgical stabilization for flail chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/11,19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19,23,24</a>]. </p><p>The systematic reviews identified three small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/1,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,26</a>] comparing the effectiveness of surgical stabilization for flail chest with nonsurgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For those randomized to surgery, significant reductions were seen for the incidence of pneumonia and chest deformity (pneumonia relative risk [RR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.85; chest deformity RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.67), and there was a trend toward a decreased need for tracheostomy (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14-1.02). No clear difference was apparent for mortality between treatment groups, but the number of deaths was small (6 out of 123). Because of differences in reporting, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and length of hospital stay could not be compared. The individual trials are summarized below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial randomly assigned 37 flail chest patients to surgical stabilization or nonoperative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All patients required mechanical ventilation. The surgically managed patients had significantly fewer days on the ventilator, shorter ICU stay, a lower incidence of pneumonia, better pulmonary function at one month, and a higher percentage of patients who returned to work at six months compared with the nonoperative group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial randomly assigned 40 patients with flail chest to surgical fixation or an external adhesive plaster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The operative group had significantly fewer patients requiring mechanical ventilation, fewer days in the ICU, shorter hospital stay, and a lower incidence of pneumonia compared with the conservatively managed group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial that included 46 patients with flail chest who were ventilator dependent, those randomized to rib fixation compared with conservative management had a significant reduction in the duration of ICU stay (324 versus 448 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A significantly decreased duration of noninvasive ventilation following extubation was found for rib fixation compared with conservative management (3 versus 50 hours). No differences were found for the duration of mechanical ventilation or for long-term outcomes, including three-month pulmonary function testing and six-month quality-of-life assessment. </p><p/><p>For the subset of patients who benefit from surgical rib fracture fixation in the acute period, surgical fixation may be more cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Studies that have evaluated cost report $2000 to $14,000 (USD) of savings for the group that underwent operation in spite of the costs associated with surgery, including the cost of implants. The higher initial cost was offset by the greater cost of longer durations of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital length of stay as well as a higher incidence of pneumonia in the medically treated group. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3697864363\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic indications (nonunion/malunion)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are also some small case series evaluating surgery for patients in the chronic setting with chronic nonunion or malunion of fractured ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p>Malunion of the rib can result in fracture callous formation between two separate ribs as a sequela of nonoperative management of severely displaced rib fractures. The true incidence is not known. Malunions can result in ongoing pain, either due to formation of a neuroma or inappropriate configuration of the ribs themselves. Operative intervention in such cases requires taking down the ossified capsule connecting the two ribs with an osteotome and resetting the ribs in an anatomically correct orientation. Osteosynthesis is then carried out using a titanium <span class=\"nowrap\">plate/screw</span> system as described below. There are no studies evaluating the efficacy of operative rib fixation for resolution of pain in this setting. </p><p>Among studies evaluating surgical fixation for nonunion or malunion of fractured ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], the studies used a combination of autologous bone graft as well as <span class=\"nowrap\">titanium/mesh</span> fixation systems and found improvement in objective pain score as well as quality-of-life measures following fixation. There are animal studies that suggest application of platelet-rich plasma at the fracture site may augment healing, but this has yet to be validated in humans, and indications for use have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3152167978\"><span class=\"h1\">RIB FRACTURE STABILIZATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1701963904\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no studies upon which to base the timing of operation. However, since the intention of the operation is to mitigate pain and avoid or resolve the need for mechanical ventilation (ie, respiratory failure), it stands to reason that the earlier the operation is performed, the better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/2,16,20,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16,20,30</a>]. We strive to carry out the operation within 48 to 72 hours of injury, with the first 24 to 48 hours being spent assuring that the patient's pain and pulmonary function cannot be adequately managed via medical measures alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures#H1068084984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inpatient management of traumatic rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Pain control'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures#H1068085015\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inpatient management of traumatic rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary care and support'</a>.)</p><p>It is reasonable to carry out rib fixation earlier if a patient requires a thoracic procedure for another reason (eg, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS] for retained hemothorax). (See <a href=\"#H2625574131\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p>Although there are no specific studies evaluating whether or not recent infection, particularly pneumonia or empyema, increases the risk of infection of the plates, it seems prudent to delay surgical stabilization until all infection has been appropriately managed. Similarly, there are no studies evaluating the impact of distant infection, such as a urinary tract infection or extremity infection, on the probability of infection of the implanted plates, but standard practice in orthopedic surgery is to avoid implanting hardware until such infection is controlled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4005290711\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrates the number, location, and characteristics of rib fractures and may be helpful for operative planning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110952\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110952 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The CT scan should be used to determine the exact location of the fractures to help determine optimal patient positioning and the location of incisions. (See <a href=\"#H3235653662\" class=\"local\">'Positioning and incisions'</a> below.)</p><p>The curvature of the ribs must be accounted for when measuring the distance from a fixed landmark to the fracture site on the CT scan. It is easiest to measure distance from the edge of the sternum to the fracture site for anterior fractures and distance from the spinous process of the vertebra to the fracture site for posterior fractures. Using the scapula as a point of reference can be misleading as the position of the scapula changes with movement of the upper extremity. If the scapula is to be used, it is important to know how the arms were positioned when the CT scan of the chest was obtained and also to account for the position of the arms when the patient is positioned on the operating table. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3199790561\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All commercially available rib plating systems require open operative repair; however, the plating systems used today have a smaller profile and less need for dissection compared with those used in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. With no systems that allow for simple reduction of the rib and placement of screws internally, there is no minimally invasive approach to rib fixation. Were such a system to be developed, the issue of the safety of placing plates in proximity to the lung would need to be addressed. Nevertheless, VATS has been used to aid localization of fractures, evacuate retained hemothorax, and perform repair of some associated injuries (eg, diaphragm rupture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3235653662\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning and incisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most rib fractures are located in the mid- to posterior axillary line, thereby requiring the patient to be placed in a lateral decubitus position. Patients can be positioned supine if the fractures are anteriorly located (ie, anterior to the anterior axillary line). Posterior fractures (ie, posterior to the posterior axillary line) can be approached with the patient in the prone or lateral decubitus positions. </p><p>Because operative rib fixation does not necessitate a thoracotomy, there is no need to follow the course of the ribs. More often than not, the fracture line on multiple rib fractures is straight, thereby allowing excellent exposure using a vertical incision centered on the fracture line itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Conversely, flail segments that are in relative proximity may be best exposed using a horizontal incision and raised flaps. However, muscle splitting and muscle sparing techniques should be used to mitigate postoperative pain to the extent that is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/16,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,33</a>]. In instances where the fracture lines of a flail segment are far apart, two incisions may be less morbid than a single large incision with raised flaps to minimize postoperative pain, seroma formation, and the potential for subsequent infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2720389291\"><span class=\"h2\">Number of fractures to repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The actual number of ribs to be repaired should be determined by weighing the length and number of incisions needed to expose the fracture, the degree of displacement of each fracture, the presence of a flail segment, and the location of the patient's pain with deep breathing. Based on chest physiology and the available evidence, fixation of all fractures is usually not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In cases where all fractures cannot be fixed, most authors recommend operative fixation of ribs 4 to 9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>The majority of chest wall movement occurs in the region of ribs 4 to 9, and therefore operative fixation of these ribs results in the greatest improvement in overall respiratory function and relief of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Ribs 1 and 2 demonstrate little movement with breathing and therefore rarely have to be surgically stabilized. Similarly, ribs 10 to 12 contribute little to chest wall stability and do not require operative repair. Furthermore, osteosynthesis of posterior fractures along ribs 1 to 3 may not be technically possible due to the location of the scapula.</p><p>One study has suggested that partial surgical stabilization of flail chest was acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, a review of 3D chest CT three months after rib fixation found that fixing only one fracture per rib in a flail segment did not avoid deformity and displacement, particularly in posterior rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is important to note that this study used absorbable plates, which most authors now recommend against. Only 50 percent of fractured ribs were surgically fixed in another study that found a significant reduction in respiratory failure and need for tracheostomy tube placement following rib plating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3492743571\"><span class=\"h2\">Plating types and techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard approach to operative fixation of the ribs uses titanium plates placed from the outside of the chest wall and secured into place using locking screws. In the past, absorbable plates were used for rib fracture fixation; however, the incidence of non- or partial healing was between 11 and 56 percent, and this type of plate is no longer used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>All dissection and manipulation of the rib should occur from the anterior and superior aspects to avoid injury to the neurovascular bundle, which is located inferior and slightly posterior to each rib. Rib fixation plates are contoured for the curvature of the rib as approached from the outside (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73486\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73486 \">image 2</a>). Because the cortex is very thin (measuring 0.5 to 1.5 mm), it cannot be used as a lever to reduce a fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This is the main reason for the differing plating systems, but there are no comparative studies upon which to base a recommendation to use one system over the other. Some plating systems recommend bicortical fixation of the plate (eg, MatrixRIB, RibFix Blu), while another (RibLoc) recommends a U-plate design that provides fixation to both sides of the cortex as well as to both the anterior and posterior aspects of the titanium plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112077\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112077 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110954\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110954 \">image 3</a>). Another system (Level One) is based upon fixation to the anterior cortex only using screws that are placed at an angle. Anterior plates should be positioned in the midportion of the rib and require a minimum of three points of fixation on each side of a fracture. U-plates should be wrapped around the superior portion of the rib to minimize risk of injury to these neurovascular bundles and require two points of fixation. A system that also involves an anterior plate (StraTos) is unique in that it does not use screws to fix the plate in place but rather uses a series of wrap-around clips to secure the plate to both the superior and inferior aspects of the rib. </p><p>Furthermore, some plating systems require drilling holes into the rib prior to insertion of screws, whereas others use self-tapping screws, thereby saving a step. Although no comparative studies have been done, it is theorized that self-tapping screws may place more stress on the rib compared with predrilled screws and may therefore fracture the thin cortex. Conversely, the need to predrill holes may add significant time to the procedure, depending on the total number of screws that need to be placed. All systems (except Level One; anterior fixation using 1.5-mm screw) require the surgeon to measure the thickness of the rib to determine the proper screw length. This is done using a caliper that is unique to each rib plating system. The soft tissues on the anterior surface of the rib and the parietal pleura on the undersurface of the rib must be dissected away to make this measurement. Use of screws that are too short can result in displacement of the plates due to poor fixation while use of screws that are too long can result in injury to the lung. </p><p>Regardless of what type of plating system is used, it is vital that plates have two to three points of screw fixation on each side of a fracture, which requires at least 3 cm on each side of a fracture. A longer landing zone is needed if the fracture follows an oblique angle or has a high degree of comminution. This can be problematic in instances where the fracture line is close to the spine. When this occurs, there are commercially available intramedullary splints that can be used to traverse a fracture and provide stability. A six-month follow-up study of patients who underwent fixation of a total of 35 rib fractures using intramedullary splints found complete healing in 94 percent of patients as assessed by 3D CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, computer modeling finds significant shear stress on splints placed across posterior fracture lines, thereby raising concern for structural fatigue and failure of the device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. There have also been reports of the splint piercing the rib cortex, which could be dangerous if it were to occur close to the spinal column. As a result, use of intramedullary splints has not gained popularity overall. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2036615046\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for thoracostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no absolute indications for placement of a thoracostomy tube, since operative rib fixation does not require violation of the pleural space. However, injuries that involve severely displaced rib fractures or reduction of displaced rib fractures intraoperatively often result in tears in the pleura. Furthermore, implantation of U-plates is associated with a higher likelihood of pleural violation than placement of anterior plates due to the need to dissect behind the rib and wrap the plate around the superior portion of the rib. In addition, using a caliper to measure rib thickness for <span class=\"nowrap\">plate/screw</span> sizing can result in perforation of the parietal pleura. Given the lack of evidence-based guidelines regarding tube thoracostomy following operative rib fixation, some authors recommend routine placement of a thoracostomy tube whereas others use a selective approach in determining the need for chest tube placement. When placed, the tube should be placed well away from the plates to decrease the probability of infection and removed as soon as possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H870645363\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general postoperative management of patients following rib fixation is centered on timely extubation, pain control, and thoracostomy tube management if such a tube was placed. Because the operation does not necessitate thoracotomy, patients usually do not experience the pulmonary inflammatory effects and fluid shifts associated with thoracic operations. Furthermore, fixation of the ribs usually results in immediate relief of pain, which, in turn, allows for extubation either on the day of or the day following operation. Medical measures for pain relief instituted prior to operation (eg,&nbsp;pharmacologic analgesia,&nbsp;regional analgesia)&nbsp;should be continued in the immediate perioperative period but can be weaned over time based on the patient's condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of whether or not a thoracostomy tube was inserted during the operation, there is no need for prolonged prophylactic perioperative antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic or its equivalent should be administered prior to the start of operation, and antibiotic prophylaxis should be discontinued within 24 hours of operation. </p><p>Management of a thoracostomy tube postoperatively follows the same principles as in general thoracic surgery. Namely, when the output from the chest tube is less than approximately 200 mL in 24 hours, there is no air leak noted in the collection system, and there is no evidence of a pneumothorax on chest radiograph, the tube should be removed. In instances where a chest tube has been inserted solely for pleural violation before or during rib fixation, the tube can usually be removed within 48 hours of operation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3795383054\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUNCTIVE TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4170566063\"><span class=\"h2\">Iliac bone graft</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An autograft from the iliac crest is the preferred graft for filling in significant defects that can result from a severely comminuted or avulsed fracture pattern. This option is the most effective for producing successful arthrodesis (or bone healing) across the fracture. However, it requires that bone be harvested from the iliac crest with the associated risk for wound complications and other morbidity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255171902\"><span class=\"h2\">Demineralized bone matrix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Demineralized bone matrix is a collagen allograft that serves as a scaffold to encourage ingrowth of osteoblasts from osteoprogenitor cells. It is a commercially prepared product that can be applied to fill in small gaps in cases with significant comminution. However, it has no mechanical integrity and is expensive. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633614854\"><span class=\"h2\">Experimental techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not proven in human studies, animal studies suggest pulsed ultrasound may augment healing of fractured ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The modality has been useful in the management of long bone fractures, including the tibia and radius. If validated in humans, this technique might be beneficial for patients who do not undergo surgical fixation of de novo fractures and may be particularly useful for those with documented nonunion of fractures. However, it would not serve as a replacement to surgical fixation, since surgical fixation is meant to facilitate pain control and resolve respiratory failure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3803258499\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications specifically related to the surgical technique of rib fracture fixation are overall uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Hardware infection is the most clinically important complication because it necessitates hardware removal in the majority of cases and is associated with a significant nonunion rate. The reported rate of hardware infection varies between 0 and 10 percent, but all reports are single center and consist of small numbers of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/20,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,43</a>]. In a report of five patients who developed a hardware infection following rib plating, three patients required removal of the plates. Treatment with antibiotics suppressed the infection, allowing the underlying fracture to heal. The mean time to plate removal was 174 days following operation. None had long-term sequelae of the infection.</p><p>Other complications include those specific to the plating system. There are isolated reports of screw displacement with anterior plating systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. This is surprising since all plating systems used locking screws that lock the screw to the plate itself. Such displacement suggests that there the screw was not sufficiently tightened to lock it to the plate at the time of insertion, or the <span class=\"nowrap\">plate/screw</span> construct pulled away from the bone due to poor overall fixation. No patient in any of the case reports was symptomatic from the displaced screws. This complication has not been reported with the U-plate system. </p><p>Aside from screw displacement, there are isolated reports of plates fracturing over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. There are no systematic reviews or large case series to describe risk factors for this, but all manufacturers recommend against using the plates to traverse a gap longer than 1 to 1.5 cm as repetitive movement of the plates will result in metal fatigue and fracture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1787313850\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rib fractures are the consequence of significant forces impacting the chest wall. Conservative treatment includes pain control and aggressive supportive pulmonary care primarily aimed at avoiding the need for intubation, which is associated with increased rates of pneumonia and death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inpatient management of traumatic rib fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (ie, osteosynthesis) may be indicated in the following circumstances (see <a href=\"#H2625574131\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impending or actual respiratory failure due to painful, movable ribs refractory to pain management strategies </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant chest wall deformity </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Displaced ribs found at the time of a thoracotomy performed for other reasons </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation (not due to pulmonary contusion or other reasons)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ongoing chest wall <span class=\"nowrap\">instability/deformity</span> or pain due to nonunion or malunion of rib fractures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rib fracture stabilization should not be performed in patients with severe pulmonary contusion as the cause for respiratory insufficiency or in patients with other concomitant injury (eg, head injury) that precludes separation from mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H4272881786\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with flail chest, early rib fracture stabilization helps to avoid the need for intubation and reduces the incidence of pneumonia and other pulmonary complications. (See <a href=\"#H2055187496\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of rib stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with indications for rib fracture stabilization, we perform the procedure once it becomes apparent that the patient's pain cannot be adequately controlled (typically 24 to 48 hours), and we try to perform the procedure within 72 hours of injury. For patients who require a thoracic procedure for other reasons, it is reasonable to carry out rib fixation earlier. (See <a href=\"#H1701963904\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rib fracture fixation is an open surgical procedure since all plating systems are designed to be placed from the outside the chest wall; however, thoracoscopy may be useful for localizing fractures. The incision is often centered vertically overlying the rib fracture lines. For flail segments, a horizontal incision may provide the best exposure; at times, two separate incisions may be needed to manage a flail injury. (See <a href=\"#H3152167978\" class=\"local\">'Rib fracture stabilization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3199790561\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several types of plate types and plate fixation methods are available. Anterior plates are positioned in the midportion of the rib, while U-plates are wrapped around the superior portion of the rib to minimize risk of injury to the neurovascular bundle. Two to three points of screw fixation are needed (depending on the type of plate) on each side of the fracture. Longer plates are needed if the fracture is oblique or comminuted to assure adequate fixation on either side of the fracture line. Fractures that are within 2 cm of the spine may not be amenable to operative fixation using standard plating systems. (See <a href=\"#H3492743571\" class=\"local\">'Plating types and techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fixation of all ribs is usually not necessary, but in general, ribs 4 to 9 to should be repaired because these ribs provide the majority of the stability to the chest wall. The actual number is determined by weighing the length and number of incisions needed to expose the fractures, the degree of displacement of each fracture, the presence of a flail segment, and the location of the patient's pain with deep breathing. (See <a href=\"#H2720389291\" class=\"local\">'Number of fractures to repair'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest tube may be needed if the pleura is violated during rib fracture fixation. This is more likely to occur for reduction of severely displaced rib fractures. Implantation of U-plates may increase the likelihood due to the need to dissect behind the rib. When needed, the thoracostomy tube should be placed well away from the plates to decrease the likelihood of hardware infection. (See <a href=\"#H3152167978\" class=\"local\">'Rib fracture stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain control measures are reinstituted postoperatively (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, COX-2 inhibitors, regional anesthesia) and weaned as tolerated. Fracture fixation typically reduces pain to the extent that extubation can be accomplished either on the day of or the day following the surgery. (See <a href=\"#H870645363\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative care'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures#H1068084984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inpatient management of traumatic rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Pain control'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other than pneumothorax, which can occur in the postoperative period if a chest tube was not initially placed, there are few complications specific to the surgical technique. Infection of hardware is a serious problem when it occurs and requires removal of the plates. The rate of nonunion in this situation is high.
