Further evaluation is determined by the presence or absence of localized findings. (See <a href=\"#H2574229028\" class=\"local\">'Patients with localized findings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1377038935\" class=\"local\">'Patients without localized findings'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with acute fatigue associated with a recognizable medical or psychosocial condition require little or no evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue caused by an underlying medical or psychological condition usually presents as one of several reported symptoms. A specific etiology for fatigue is found less often when it is the principal or only complaint.</p><p>In taking a history, the clinician should rely upon open-ended questions, encouraging the patient to describe the fatigue in his or her own words. Questions such as &quot;What do you mean by fatigue?&quot; or &quot;Please describe what you mean&quot; may elicit responses that help distinguish fatigue from muscle weakness or somnolence. Patients should be asked if they have any ideas about what might be causing or contributing to their fatigue.</p><p>The history should also determine the characteristics, severity, and temporal pattern of fatigue:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset &ndash; Abrupt or gradual, relationship to illness or life event</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Course &ndash; Stable, improving, or worsening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration and daily pattern</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that alleviate or exacerbate it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact on daily life &ndash; Ability to work, socialize, participate in family activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accommodations that the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> has had to make to deal with symptom</p><p/><p>Examples of patient survey instruments that are used in clinical practice to assess fatigue include the Brief Fatigue Inventory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54810 \">table 3</a>) and Fatigue Symptom Inventory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-fatigue/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Patients with underlying medical conditions often associate fatigue with activities they are unable to complete. By contrast, patients with fatigue that is related to psychological conditions, medication toxicity, or substance use may be tired all the time; their fatigue is not necessarily related to exertion, and it does not improve with rest.</p><p>Associated symptoms may suggest specific etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116315\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116315 \">table 1</a>). For example, sleep apnea would be suspected in a patient who describe snoring and disrupted sleep, anemia in a patient who reports dizziness and weakness, and fibromyalgia in a patient who describes chronic diffuse muscle pain. The presence of fever may suggest underlying infection, and unintended weight loss may indicate an occult neoplasm or recurrent disease in a patient with a history of malignancy. If history suggests a chronic pattern of unexplained physical symptoms, somatization should also be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All patients should be asked about symptoms suggestive of depression (eg, sad mood, anhedonia, alteration in sleep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eating habits) and anxiety disorder (eg, constant palpitations or sweating, occurrence of panic attacks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> phobias) and screened for these conditions using validated instruments such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 or PHQ-9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 5</a>) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77755 \">table 6</a>).

Use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, first-generation antihistamines, beta-blockers, and opioids may be associated with fatigue.</p><p>A family medical history should also be performed to determine if there is a genetic predisposition to any specific cancer(s) or other chronic medical conditions.

Serologic testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is recommended if the patient has not been screened in the past or is at risk from sexual or drug use behaviors.

For example, testing for tuberculosis (eg, purified protein derivative [PPD] or gamma-interferon release assay, chest radiograph, sputum collection) should be performed if appropriate based upon the patient&rsquo;s history and risk factors for exposure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) should be performed in older patients who also have symptoms consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell (temporal) arteritis.

As an example, in a prospective study of 100 adults with the chief complaint of fatigue for at least one month, laboratory studies clarified the cause in only 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-fatigue/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nonspecific minor laboratory abnormalities were common and did not influence the clinical outcome. A low pretest probability for a specific disease leads to an increased risk of false-positive results and unnecessary follow-up diagnostic tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3110450146\"><span class=\"h3\">Updating of cancer screening interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate cancer screening interventions based upon the patient&rsquo;s age and sex should be updated as necessary to exclude common occult malignancies as a potential cause for fatigue. For example, patients &ge;50 year of age should be screened for colon cancer with colonoscopy or another acceptable modality if not done within the past 10 years; patients 55 to 74 years of age with &ge;30 pack-year cigarette smoking history should undergo an annual low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs; and women &gt;40 years of age should be screened for breast cancer with mammography if not done within the past one to two years.

For example, a patient presenting with fatigue associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/chills,</span> night sweats, and myalgias associated with a new heart murmur should have blood cultures and an echocardiogram performed for evaluation of subacute bacterial endocarditis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H4084836\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>).

In the absence of suggestive symptoms or physical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116315\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116315 \">table 1</a>), we do <strong>not</strong> recommend routine testing for infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], Lyme serologies), immunologic deficiency (eg, immunoglobulins), inflammatory disease (eg, antinuclear antibodies [ANA], rheumatoid factor), vitamin deficiencies, or celiac disease (eg, tissue transglutaminase antibody [TTGA] immunoglobulin A [IgA]). We also do <strong>not</strong> recommend radiologic imaging (eg, chest radiograph, abdominal CT scan) in the absence of clinical suspicion of a specific disease. Our approach is similar to that recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group for the evaluation of suspected chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-fatigue/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Patients who remain undiagnosed with an identifiable condition after six months are designated as having idiopathic chronic fatigue or <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> if they meet diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F99875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99875 \">table 2</a>).

Their fatigue should be monitored with management of the underlying condition to see if it improves or resolves. If it does not, further evaluation may be warranted to determine if there is an alternative explanation. Repeating the initial evaluation is worthwhile in this setting to make sure that other potential diagnoses were not missed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3911632954\"><span class=\"h2\">Addressing residual or idiopathic fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with residual or idiopathic fatigue, we suggest an empiric trial of antidepressant therapy for patients with depressive symptoms even if they do not meet diagnostic criteria for major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 7</a>). We do <strong>not</strong> suggest the empiric use of stimulants or other drug therapies.

It typically involves a series of one-hour sessions designed to alter beliefs and behaviors that may delay recovery. CBT components include explanation of the model for chronic fatigue, challenging beliefs and awareness of fatigue and reorienting these beliefs, achievement of physical activity goals and other personal goals, and helping the patient attain control over symptoms. CBT in the management of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFS/SEID)</span> is discussed separately.

It is based on a physiological model of deconditioning. Unlike CBT, exercise therapy does not address cognition.

The term &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; can be used to describe difficulty or inability to initiate activity (subjective sense of weakness); reduced capacity to maintain activity (easy fatigability); or difficulty with concentration, memory, and emotional stability (mental fatigue). Patients may report one or a combination of these symptoms, and they may occur alone or in conjunction with localized complaints. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute and chronic fatigue is likely to be associated with an underlying chronic medical or psychological condition, medication toxicity, or substance use. The cause of chronic fatigue can be identified in approximately two-thirds of patients. In the remaining cases, chronic fatigue is designated as idiopathic chronic fatigue or attributed to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), in patients who meet diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F99875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99875 \">table 2</a>). Both of these conditions are diagnoses of exclusion. (See <a href=\"#H1918278067\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial assessment of the patient presenting with subacute or chronic fatigue includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, basic laboratory studies, and updated cancer screening interventions to identify findings that could suggest a specific underlying cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116315\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116315 \">table 1</a>). Further diagnostic evaluation is determined by the presence or absence of localized findings. (See <a href=\"#H3129959892\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment of all patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute fatigue associated with a recognizable medical or psychosocial condition require little or no evaluation. For patients with subacute or chronic fatigue as the primary symptom, we obtain the following initial laboratory studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complete blood count with differential count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chemistries (including glucose, electrolytes, calcium, renal and hepatic function tests)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thyroid-stimulating hormone </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Creatine kinase (if muscle pain or weakness present)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Appropriate cancer screening interventions based upon the patient&rsquo;s age and sex should be updated as necessary to exclude common occult malignancies as a potential cause for fatigue. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and radiologic studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3110450146\" class=\"local\">'Updating of cancer screening interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an identified cause of chronic fatigue based upon the initial evaluation should be treated specifically for the condition. In patients with residual or idiopathic fatigue, we suggest an empiric trial of antidepressant therapy for patients with depressive symptoms even if they do not meet diagnostic criteria for major depression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We do <strong>not</strong> suggest the empiric use of stimulants or other drug therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If there is no improvement, we suggest a trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> graded exercise therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
