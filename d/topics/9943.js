Although lipid abnormalities and CVD are common complications of kidney transplantation, a causal association of dyslipidemias with cardiovascular risk has not been proven in this patient population.</p><p>However, extrapolation from general population studies and some data in kidney transplant patients support the view that the assessment and treatment of dyslipidemias should be part of routine postrenal transplant care. Since immunosuppressive medications often cause secondary dyslipidemias, medication regimens should be individualized to minimize the competing risks of rejection and CVD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to the high incidence of atherosclerotic disease events in the renal transplant population, we and several national groups suggest that patients with kidney transplants should be considered to be in the highest ASCVD risk group with respect to risk factor management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Renal transplantation should therefore be considered a coronary heart disease equivalent risk. The prevalence and ability to modify dyslipidemias therefore render lipid modification a potentially important intervention for improving outcomes after kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the causes and management of lipid abnormalities in an attempt to lower cardiovascular risk in renal transplant recipients. The evidence concerning other putative benefits of lipid-lowering therapy among renal transplant recipients, including preservation of renal function and lower acute rejection risk, will also be discussed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5604446\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyslipidemia is defined by elevated plasma total cholesterol, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), elevated triglycerides, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), all factors that may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia is a frequent complication prior to and after kidney transplantation, even when allograft function is normal or near normal.</p><p>Increases in total cholesterol and LDL levels are the most common abnormalities, with elevated hypertriglyceride levels also usually noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Historically, single- and multicenter reports have estimated that, by one year posttransplant, 80 to 90 percent of adult recipients have total cholesterol levels &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and 90 to 97 percent have LDL levels &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Mean reported triglyceride levels values ranged from 160 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 to 2.26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A more recent, multicenter, prospective cohort study reported LDL levels &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> among 45 percent of patients and mean triglyceride levels of 142 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> at six months posttransplant, patterns that likely reflects lower target levels in contemporary maintenance immunosuppression regimens, as well as concomitant statin treatment in 41 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], although the use of lipid-lowering therapies varies by factors including allograft function and immunosuppression. Linkage of the US national transplant registry to a large pharmacy claims database identified statin use at the first transplant anniversary ranging from 30.8 percent in those with an estimated glomerular filtration level (eGFR) &gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> to 37 to 42 percent among those with lower eGFR levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A similar analysis of US kidney transplant recipients (2005 to 2010) reported higher statin use during the period 6 to 12 months posttransplant among those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> (46 percent) and cyclosporine-based immunosuppression (42.6 percent) compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (36.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

HDL levels &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> have been estimated in 14 to 48 percent of transplant recipients at one year or later posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one small study of longitudinal trends in lipid levels before and after kidney transplant, transplantation was associated with an increase in HDL levels, but the benefit was dependent upon maintenance of allograft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppressive agents, particularly corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and rapamycin, have well-known dose-related effects on serum lipid levels. Other secondary causes in this patient population may include the nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, excessive alcohol intake, obesity, and chronic liver disease. Genetic predisposition and low daily exercise also contribute to dyslipidemia.</p><p>Balancing risks of rejection, immunosuppressive therapy, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, and treatment options is complex.</p><p>Given that allograft failure is the principal risk to a patient's health, dyslipidemia may be tolerated, even if it cannot be treated optimally, and is related to immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, if the perceived risks of dyslipidemia are less than the risk of alternative immunosuppression associated with decreased adverse lipid effect, immunosuppressive therapy should take precedence over dyslipidemic therapy. In general, we are inclined to replace <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> if dyslipidemia occurs, and continue low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at 5 mg per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroids alter lipoprotein metabolism to cause dyslipidemia, particularly elevated cholesterol levels, via multiple indirect pathways.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) Guideline identified four major groups of patients for whom there was robust evidence of benefit of statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk, which outweighed the risk of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. These groups were defined as individuals with clinical ASCVD; individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C &gt;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> diabetic patients aged 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and without clinical ASCVD; or individuals without clinical ASCVD or diabetes with LDL-C 70 to 189 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk &gt;7.5 percent.</p><p>The traditional &quot;treat-to-goal&quot; paradigm was replaced with use of clinical criteria as the indication for therapy. This was based on the rationale that, among these groups in the general population (ie, without kidney disease), randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated reductions in ASCVD events with use of the maximum-tolerated statin therapy in specific groups.</p><p>Furthermore, there is concern that use of LDL-C targets may result in undertreatment with statin therapy or overtreatment with nonstatin drugs that have not been shown to reduce ASCVD events in randomized, controlled trials. However, while randomized-controlled-trial evidence to support lipid levels as treatment targets was not identified, measurement of fasting lipid levels and percentage reductions in LDL-C were deemed reasonable for assessing the response to therapy and adherence, with &quot;high-intensity&quot; therapy defined as an average LDL-C reduction &gt;50 percent from the untreated baseline, &quot;moderate-intensity&quot; therapy defined as LDL-C reductions of 30 to &lt;50 percent from the untreated baseline, and &quot;low-intensity&quot; defined as an average &lt;30 percent reduction in LDL-C. The <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guideline advises measurement of an initial fasting lipid panel before initiation of statin therapy, followed by a second measurement 4 to 12 weeks later to assess adherence and then repeat measurements every 3 to 12 months, as clinically indicated.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guideline concluded that there was insufficient randomized-controlled-trial evidence for guiding clinical recommendations for some groups, including solid-organ transplant recipients and individuals &lt;40 years of age with low estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, but high lifetime ASCVD. Thus, clinical judgment weighing potential benefits, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences was advised for these groups.</p><p>Considering the same evidence from the transplant population summarized above, the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Lipid Management in CKD recommended treatment with statins in all adult kidney transplant recipients but noted that supporting evidence was considered weak since there was only a single, large, randomized, controlled trial in this population, the ALERT trial, cited above, which showed a trend towards reduction in the ASCVD endpoint, but, as noted, failed to reach statistical significance in the primary trial. Although this recommendation was not stratified by demographic or clinical factors, the risk of ASCVD is age dependent, and the ALERT trial did not enroll participants &lt;30 years of age. Thus, inclusion of adult kidney transplant recipients age 18 to 29 years in this KDIGO recommendation is opinion based.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4999952\"><span class=\"h2\">Ezetimibe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For transplant recipients who do not tolerate statins, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> as a second choice.

Thus, the assessment and treatment of dyslipidemias in kidney transplant patients should be part of routine postrenal transplant care.

Regimens should therefore be individualized to minimize competing risks of rejection and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
