A number of diagnostic tests are available, but their interpretation can be challenging. Once iron overload is diagnosed, the options for treatment are relatively straightforward in the majority of individuals. However, untreated individuals can develop life-threatening organ toxicity. Thus, it is important to identify iron overload before organ damage occurs.</p><p>An approach to evaluating individuals with suspected iron deficiency is presented here.</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss the regulation of iron balance, the diagnosis of and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and the management of iron overload.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iron balance</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HH population screening</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HH diagnosis</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HH treatment</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HH genetics</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chelation therapy</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-chelators-choice-of-agent-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Therapeutic phlebotomy</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Phlebotomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thalassemia: Management after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Iron stores'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4079690736\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL IRON STORES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal iron content of the body is 3 to 4 grams. It exists in the following forms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin in circulating red cells &ndash; Approximately 2.5 grams</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron-containing proteins other than hemoglobin (eg, myoglobin, cytochromes, catalase) &ndash; 400 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron bound to transferrin in plasma &ndash; 3 to 7 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Storage iron in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin</p><p/><p>Adult men have approximately 1 g of storage iron (mostly in liver, spleen, and bone marrow). Adult women have less storage iron, depending upon the extent of menses, pregnancies, deliveries, lactation, and iron intake, and some may have no stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Total body iron content is determined by the balance between dietary iron intake (or other sources such as transfusion) and iron loss from bleeding or shedding of iron-containing cells; there are no physiologic mechanisms to eliminate iron from the body when it is present in excess:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intake</strong> &ndash; A typical Western diet in resource-rich settings contains approximately 10 to 20 mg of iron; approximately 10 percent of this is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Heme iron (eg, iron in meats) is better absorbed than non-heme iron (eg, iron from vegetable sources). Other factors that influence the efficiency of iron absorption are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;, section on 'Intestinal iron absorption'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loss</strong> &ndash; Iron is normally lost in sweat, shed skin cells, and gastrointestinal loss at a rate of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Menstruating women lose additional iron, equivalent to 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recycling</strong> &ndash; Iron is recycled from the breakdown of senescent red blood cells in the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.</p><p/><p>While removal of iron from the body is not regulated, the absorption of iron from intestinal cells and the release of storage iron from macrophages is highly controlled, in a process involving a number of transport proteins and their regulators. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance#H15257196\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;, section on 'Role of specific proteins'</a>.)</p><p>In hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), genetic variants in one of these regulators (typically, homozygous C282Y mutation in the <em>HFE </em>gene or compound heterozygosity for <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/H63D)</span> leads to excessive intestinal iron absorption; other causes of increased iron stores include ineffective erythropoiesis (eg, in thalassemia), and a large number of red blood cell transfusions for indications other than blood loss (eg, hemoglobinopathies, hematologic neoplasms). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Causes of iron overload'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF IRON OVERLOAD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2701737718\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron overload can occur because iron intake is increased or iron absorption is increased in the setting of normal intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105365 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major cause of increased intake is from multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for chronic anemia (eg, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, myelodysplastic syndrome). Less common causes include the excessive use of iron supplements or therapeutic infusions of iron-containing products such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>, used to treat certain porphyrias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major causes of increased absorption include hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) due to mutations in <em>HFE</em>; ineffective erythropoiesis that occurs in thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, and certain other inherited anemias; and liver disease, especially alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis. Less common causes include gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) and rare mutations affecting iron absorption or iron distribution.</p><p/><p>Importantly, patients often have more than one cause of iron overload. A classic example is transfusional iron overload in an individual with beta thalassemia major. Other examples include genetic factors in individuals with excessive use of iron supplements, ingestion of alcohol stored in iron-containing barrels, or alcoholic liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478874597\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusional iron overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusional iron overload occurs when transfusions are given for anemia not caused by iron deficiency. Examples include thalassemias, in which iron overload is compounded by increased absorption due to ineffective erythropoiesis, as well as sickle cell disease, other inherited anemias, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, other hematologic malignancies, and hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H105104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Excessive iron stores'</a>.)</p><p>For individuals without iron deficiency, it is generally accepted that transfusion of more than 15 to 20 units of RBCs (more than 10 units in smaller children) can cause clinically significant iron overload. This is based on the approximation that each unit of RBCs has about 250 mg of iron. However, some individuals with ineffective erythropoiesis who also have increased iron absorption may develop iron overload earlier. The correlation between the total volume of transfusions and clinical manifestations of iron overload is not exact, and clinical judgement is required in determining when to assess for iron overload.</p><p>Individuals receiving chronic transfusions are typically monitored using serum ferritin levels, with liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac MRI once ferritin levels consistently exceed a certain threshold, typically in the range of 1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> on at least two measurements at least one to two months apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. We also perform liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac imaging in any patient who has received 30 or more units of RBCs regardless of ferritin level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399258577\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary hemochromatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased absorption of intestinal iron, which in some cases can lead to excessive iron stores. HH is caused by mutations in the <em>HFE</em> gene, typically homozygous <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/C282Y</span> or compound heterozygous <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/H63D</span>. Other <em>HFE</em> mutations and mutations in other iron regulatory genes have also been reported (eg, ferroportin, hemojuvelin, hepcidin, ceruloplasmin). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with HH can absorb as much as 2 to 4 mg of dietary iron per day (twice the rate of individuals without HH). If the typical iron requirements to compensate for normal physiological iron losses is in the range of 1 to 2 mg per day, this increased absorption can result in as much as an additional 3 mg per day in excess of needs. (See <a href=\"#H4079690736\" class=\"local\">'Normal iron stores'</a> above.)</p><p>Over time, iron accumulation can thus occur in the range of 1 gram per year (10 grams per decade). This explains the typical presentation of adult males with signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis in the fourth to fifth decades, and the slightly later presentation of women, who have additional iron losses due to menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with a family history of HH should be screened for <em>HFE</em> mutations (or in rare cases, other familial mutations), based on the rationale that if HH is present, therapy is straightforward and well-tolerated and can prevent permanent end-organ damage. In the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) study, self-reported information about the family history had a sensitivity of 81 percent and a specificity of 97 percent for an accurate report, supporting the use of family history as a good screening tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If the individual has homozygosity for <em>HFE</em> C282Y or compound heterozygosity <span class=\"nowrap\">(C282Y/H63D),</span> then iron studies and liver function tests should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H3415645\" class=\"local\">'Sequence and interpretation of testing'</a> below.)</p><p>For those with a positive family history of HH, the ideal age to perform genetic testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver iron assessment has not been determined. Deferring screening until adulthood is reasonable because this permits the individual to give informed consent for testing, and iron stores are not expected to be high until later. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Ethical, legal, and psychosocial issues'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>The appropriate screening tests include genetic testing to determine whether one (or both) of the familial mutations have been inherited, and iron studies to determine the severity of iron overload in those who have inherited the familial mutation(s). These can be done sequentially with mutation testing followed by iron studies only in those with the implicated mutations; in some cases it may be cost effective to order the testing simultaneously. If the individual is known to lack the familial mutations or to have inherited only one mutation, iron studies are unnecessary unless indicated for another reason.</p><p>Screening family members of an individual with HH, interpretation of the results, and appropriate testing for those who have inherited the familial mutations are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Detection in family members'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H935872808\"><span class=\"h2\">Ineffective erythropoiesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ineffective erythropoiesis refers to a process in which RBC precursors are destroyed (eg, by apoptosis or hemolysis) before they differentiate into mature RBCs; this is manifested by intense erythroid hyperplasia in the bone marrow with a low peripheral blood reticulocyte count. This process is most commonly seen in thalassemia; similar findings may occur in sideroblastic anemias. As noted above, the associated iron overload may be compounded by frequent RBC transfusions for anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia#H392164461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;, section on 'Ineffective erythropoiesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;, section on 'Ineffective erythropoiesis'</a>.)</p><p>Ineffective erythropoiesis is also seen in megaloblastic anemias such as anemia due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency; however, the underlying condition is usually treated before significant iron accumulation can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies#H2645453866\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;, section on 'Hematopoiesis'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, sickle cell disease and autoimmune hemolytic anemias are not associated with ineffective erythropoiesis; in these anemias, hemolysis primarily affects mature RBCs in the peripheral circulation rather than RBC precursors in the bone marrow. Individuals with these disorders can develop transfusional iron overload, but they are not at increased risk of iron overload attributable to their hemolytic anemia.</p><p>Ineffective erythropoiesis leads to increased intestinal iron absorption by an unclear mechanism. Reduced hepcidin levels appear to be involved but the suppressors of hepcidin are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. The functions of these proteins are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3309414554\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of acute and chronic liver disorders are associated with inflammation and a subsequent increase in acute phase reactants, including ferritin. In addition, the liver is a major site for iron storage in the body, and any process that damages liver cells has the potential to release storage iron into the circulation, leading to an increase in ferritin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In some cases, there is also increased iron absorption and increased iron deposition in the liver, although typically not to the extent seen in individuals with HH. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>GALD</strong> &ndash; Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD; also called neonatal hemochromatosis or neonatal iron storage disease) occurs when maternal alloantibodies cross the placenta and cause injury to the fetal liver, leading to severe liver failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cirrhosis in the newborn. Hepatic and extrahepatic iron deposition is often seen, but this deposition is a consequence of liver injury, not a cause. This condition is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;, section on 'Gestational alloimmune liver disease (neonatal hemochromatosis)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alcoholic liver disease</strong> &ndash; Alcoholic liver disease may be associated with increased stainable iron in the liver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic liver diseases</strong> &ndash; Other chronic liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic viral hepatitis, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), or chronic hepatitis from other causes may also lead to increased liver iron. In patients with PCT, phlebotomy improves the iron deposition as well as the underlying pathogenesis of the disease related to impaired iron biosynthesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1422430768\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Central importance of iron in PCT'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The mechanism of increased iron absorption in liver disease is incompletely understood but is likely caused by decreased hepcidin production in the diseased liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>As noted above, some individuals with iron overload secondary to liver disease may also have a genetic component such as an <em>HFE</em> mutation(s) that contributes to increased iron absorption, sometimes exacerbating the liver injury. In other cases, it may not be clear which came first, liver disease or iron overload. In others, the severity of the initial liver injury may be challenging to determine (eg, unclear amount or duration of excess alcohol intake). These issues provide the rationale for performing genetic testing for HH in some cases.

Primary erythrocytosis is caused by increased proliferation of erythroid cells in the bone marrow (eg, polycythemia vera or other myeloproliferative neoplasm [MPN]). MPNs are often associated with increased ferritin levels in the setting of transfusional iron overload, but MPNs are not associated with total body iron overload in the absence of transfusions.

This has been illustrated in studies that show a poor correlation between iron studies and total body iron burden in individuals with liver disease of various causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Routine iron studies include serum iron, transferrin (also reported as total iron binding capacity [TIBC]), and ferritin; the transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated as the ratio of serum iron to TIBC and expressed as a percentage (TSAT = iron &divide; TIBC x 100). The results most useful for evaluating iron overload are the ferritin and TSAT, both of which are elevated in iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ferritin</strong> &ndash; The normal range for ferritin in plasma or serum is approximately 40 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (40 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L;</span> 89.9 to 449.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">picomoles/L)</span>. A ferritin level &ge;200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (&ge;200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> in a man or &ge;150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (&ge;150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> in a woman is consistent with iron overload, and a level below these values is good evidence that the patient does not have iron overload.

Ferritin is an acute phase reactant that increases in the setting of infection or inflammation. Ferritin can also be elevated in patients with liver disease. It is important to distinguish these other causes of abnormally high ferritin in order to avoid unnecessary invasive testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delays in treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2809733634\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In individuals with iron overload, there is some correlation between the ferritin level and the total body iron burden (eg, individuals with a ferritin in the range of 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are unlikely to have severe iron overload; those with ferritin in the range of 3000 to 4000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> may have substantial iron burden), but there is a relatively high discordance between individuals and between measurements for the same individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is the author's observation (BB) that the correlation between iron stores and ferritin levels is only reliable up to a ferritin level of 3000 to 4000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. For higher ferritin levels, there must be some other cause such as the release of intracellular ferritin from damaged cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Observational studies have generally found some weak correlations between ferritin and iron burden assessed by other measures (eg, liver biopsy, therapeutic phlebotomy), but results are mixed, and sensitivity and specificity are in the range of 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/26-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TSAT</strong> &ndash; A TSAT &ge;45 percent is consistent with iron overload; a TSAT &lt;45 percent is good evidence that the patient does not have iron overload, even if the ferritin is elevated. An increased TSAT may precede an increased ferritin, and rarely, a person may have an isolated increased TSAT without overt iron overload or organ damage, especially in a younger adult. An elevated TSAT with a normal ferritin suggests that the individual is at risk for, or in the early stages of, iron overload. Such individuals are likely to benefit from further monitoring to determine whether the TSAT normalizes or the ferritin increases. (See <a href=\"#H1028535210\" class=\"local\">'Organ damage from reactive oxygen species'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>There are several factors that may confound ferritin and TSAT measurements, including diet and comorbidities, especially liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/20,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34</a>]. Ferritin and TSAT can be elevated in liver disease because dying hepatocytes release storage iron into the circulation and alcohol may suppress hepcidin synthesis, leading to increased intestinal iron absorption. TSAT may be increased in liver disease caused by excess alcohol because alcohol suppresses liver transferrin synthesis. As noted above, ferritin is also an acute phase reactant. Thus, it is ideal to obtain at least two independent measurements. There is no simple algorithm to follow when the ferritin and TSAT are discordant; the clinical context determines the likely interpretation and the subsequent approach. Hematology consultation may be appropriate in these cases.</p><p>If the patient is in the midst of an acute infection or inflammation, it may be prudent to delay iron studies testing until the acute event has resolved, or if the studies have already been performed, to repeat them after the acute event has resolved, rather than pursuing more aggressive testing for iron overload such as MRI. An exception is suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, for which elevated ferritin is one of the diagnostic criteria. If it is not clear whether the patient has an acute infection or inflammatory process, then the C-reactive protein (CRP) can be checked. A normal CRP is inconsistent with inflammation or infection and in most cases eliminates these as an explanation for the increased ferritin.</p><p>Some clinicians prefer to use fasting samples for iron studies. This is not supported by data from clinical studies, but it is not unreasonable to use at least one fasting sample, especially in individuals with a borderline result or discordance between clinical and laboratory findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For an individual with increased ferritin in the setting of an ongoing inflammatory process such as malignancy, diabetes, or connective tissue disease, other testing is likely to be needed to determine whether there is total body iron overload (eg, MRI, course of phlebotomy, biopsy).</p><p>Additional information about iron studies including iron studies measurements used to evaluate iron deficiency are discussed separately.

This is especially true for those with thalassemia and other severe, transfusion-dependent anemias associated with ineffective erythropoiesis such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Imaging of both the liver and heart is important because iron accumulation is not uniform. If the clinical history strongly suggests a cause of iron overload such as implicated <em>HFE</em> mutations, multiple RBC transfusions (eg, more than 20 to 30 units, for any indication), or beta thalassemia intermedia in the absence of transfusions, then a ferritin value above the upper limit of normal with a transferrin saturation above 45 percent is an appropriate threshold for performing MRI.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver MRI</strong> &ndash; A liver iron concentration (LIC) estimated by MRI &gt;3 to 7 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">Fe/g</span> dry weight (equivalent to approximately 53 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g</span> dry weight) indicates the presence of hepatic iron overload.

In iron overload, the ferritin level will decline as iron is removed. Others use liver biopsy with quantitation of liver iron content. (See <a href=\"#H8583055\" class=\"local\">'Liver biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>Phlebotomy can only be safely performed in individuals who do not have significant anemia or other comorbidities that would prevent them from tolerating the procedure. Typical settings for phlebotomy are individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis or individuals with transfusional iron overload who undergo treatments to correct their anemia and thus can tolerate phlebotomy (eg, people with sickle cell disease [SCD] treated with exchange transfusion; or people with thalassemia, SCD, aplastic anemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT] and are no longer severely anemic). In these individuals, we generally use noninvasive methods to assess iron stores (eg, ferritin, TSAT, liver MRI) and correlate these results with the number of phlebotomies that can be performed before the patient becomes iron deficient. However, if there is no access to these noninvasive tests, serial phlebotomies with assessment of the number of units of blood removed is a reasonable alternative for determining the total body iron burden.</p><p>Each phlebotomy of 500 mL of whole blood will remove approximately 200 to 250 mg of elemental iron. Thus, an individual with total body iron stores of 5 grams (corresponding to a liver iron content of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> dry weight) would require approximately 20 phlebotomies to reach an iron deficient state. We typically perform phlebotomy of 500 mL of blood one to two times per week until the patient's hemoglobin has fallen to approximately 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> the red blood cells have become slightly microcytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] approximately 75 to 80 fL), and the transferrin saturation and ferritin are below normal (&lt;15 percent and &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> respectively), and then calculate the iron burden from the number of phlebotomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Like iron overload, the ferritin is above normal and the patient may have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue. Unlike iron overload, in most inflammatory states the degree of ferritin elevation does not exceed two to three times normal, the transferrin saturation (TSAT) typically does not exceed 45 percent, and there are other features of the clinical picture or signs of inflammation such as increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase reactants. This was illustrated in a 2012 population-based case-control study of 766 middle-aged adult outpatients in which 329 met criteria for metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Thus, the presence of an extremely high ferritin level does not exclude the possibility of an inflammatory condition, and the presence of an inflammatory condition does not eliminate the possibility of iron overload.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver injury</strong> &ndash; In liver disease (eg, viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), injury to hepatocytes may cause an increase in serum ferritin despite normal total body iron stores. Like iron overload, there may be increased transaminases and jaundice. Unlike iron overload, in liver disease, total liver iron (as estimated by MRI or measured by liver biopsy) is not increased, and therapeutic phlebotomy would not improve the ferritin level. Importantly, iron overload can cause liver disease, and each can exacerbate the other. Thus, the presence of liver disease does not exclude the possibility of iron overload, and the presence of iron overload does not exclude the possibility of underlying liver disease.

In HLH and the related macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; associated with underlying <span class=\"nowrap\">rheumatologic/connective</span> tissue disease), the ferritin is often extremely high, in the range of 5000 to 20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (or even higher) and the presentation is often acute severe illness with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, neurologic findings, and pancytopenia.

As discussed above, these conditions are often associated with elevated ferritin, because the liver is the major site for iron storage and liver damage will cause ferritin to be released into the circulation.

As noted above, liver iron is not necessarily predictive of cardiac iron burden. Thus, cardiac MRI is appropriate in individuals with significant transfusional iron overload or significant iron overload from hereditary hemochromatosis, as well as those with heart failure or cardiac conduction abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/22,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,59</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1478874597\" class=\"local\">'Transfusional iron overload'</a> above.)</p><p>The degree of iron overload that causes organ damage varies among patients. However, as a general rule, total body iron stores above 5 grams and liver iron concentration &gt;7 mg per gram of dry liver weight are associated with an increased risk of iron-induced complications such as hepatic fibrosis and diabetes. In individuals with transfusional iron overload, this corresponds to approximately 20 to 30 transfusions (fewer in those with thalassemia, who have abnormally high iron uptake as well). Liver iron concentrations &gt;15 mg per gram of dry liver weight are associated with a substantial risk for hepatic fibrosis, cardiac disease, and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Additional testing to characterize organ damage is listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60117\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60117 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10044335\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the cause(s)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of iron overload are listed in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105365 \">table 1</a>).

Moreover, the common form of this genetic disorder has low clinical penetrance and therefore likely to be underdiagnosed.</p><p>Regardless of whether an individual is initially diagnosed with an inherited or acquired cause of iron overload, the possibility of other causes of iron overload should also be addressed. As an example, a common scenario is an individual with increased ferritin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transferrin saturation in the setting of excess alcohol use and liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In such individuals, it may be difficult to assess the amount of alcohol intake, the degree of total body iron overload, and the contribution of other factors such as <em>HFE</em> gene mutations. If there is concomitant cirrhosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal bleeding, these estimations may be even more difficult (cirrhosis may affect the distribution of hepatic iron deposition; bleeding may decrease total body iron stores).</p><p>These cases require an individualized approach. The following may be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>HFE</em> mutation testing should be performed if there is any doubt about the possibility of a contribution of HH to excess iron stores. This includes all adults with iron overload not due to transfusions, and some individuals with transfusional iron overload, especially if the iron burden appears to be out of proportion to the number of transfusions administered. The importance of <em>HFE</em> mutation testing was examined in a study involving 132 individuals with liver disease who underwent <em>HFE</em> mutation testing; of these, 45 (34 percent) had <em>HFE</em> mutations and 6 (5 percent) were homozygous for C282Y, the classical form of HH, with the rest having mutations of lower or marginal significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Testing for the two common mutations (C282Y and H63D) is relatively inexpensive; homozygosity for C282Y strongly supports a component of iron overload; compound heterozygosity for <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/H63D</span> confirms a likely contribution of iron overload in the appropriate setting (eg, middle aged adult); and negative results essentially eliminate the possibility of HH. The likelihood of iron overload with these and other genotypes is discussed separately.

Higher values are consistent with iron overload but are not particularly specific, and additional testing is often indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111015\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111015 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3415645\" class=\"local\">'Sequence and interpretation of testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of iron overload may be suspected by one or more of the following findings (see <a href=\"#H746968\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased serum ferritin (&ge;200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [&ge;200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L]</span> in men, &ge;150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [&ge;150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L]</span> in women) in a patient without significant inflammation and increased TSAT (&ge;45 percent). Often we repeat these measurements. An increased TSAT may precede an increased ferritin, and rarely, a person may have an isolated increased TSAT without overt iron overload or organ damage, especially in a younger adult. This finding suggests increased risk for iron overload or early stages of iron overload and warrants close monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H3415721\" class=\"local\">'CBC, LFTs, and iron studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evidence of iron overload by MRI of the liver (liver iron concentration &gt;3 to 7 mg per gram of dry liver weight) or heart (cardiac T2* by MRI &lt;20 milliseconds).

Other conditions that may be associated with an extremely high ferritin level include hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH); human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, especially when the CD4 count is low and there is an opportunistic infection; and cancer, especially hematologic malignancies.

The cause of iron overload should be determined, keeping in mind that there may be multiple causes. <em>HFE</em> mutation testing should be performed in all adults with iron overload not due to transfusions, and some individuals with transfusional iron overload, especially if the iron burden appears to be out of proportion to the number of transfusions administered. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Post-diagnostic testing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for <em>HFE </em>mutations in asymptomatic first degree relatives of individuals with HH is addressed separately.
