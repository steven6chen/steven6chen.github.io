The molecular pathophysiologies of many of the disorders underlying primary immunodeficiency are defined. A number of medical therapies have provided dramatic improvements in life expectancy and quality of life for immunodeficient patients. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is clearly indicated for severe immunodeficiencies (eg, severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]) that are lethal in the first few years of life. However, improvements in HCT have led to better outcomes and should prompt serious consideration of HCT for patients with a number of other immunodeficiency disorders associated with significant morbidity and shortened lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>HCT is the only potentially curative nonexperimental therapy available for many primary immunodeficiencies, including various forms of SCID, several severe immunodeficiency syndromes (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, and nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator [NEMO] deficiency), and diseases of immune dysregulation (IPEX [immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked], familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Chediak-Higashi syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These are only some examples of many disorders for which HCT should be considered.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the use of HCT in the treatment of severe primary immunodeficiency states. For several of these disorders, the role of HCT is discussed in more detail separately.

Knowing whether the mutation is new (ie, sporadic) or inherited allows accurate genetic counseling and prenatal testing in the case of future pregnancies. This information permits parents to choose to abort fetuses who have, or are at high risk of, a particular defect. For pregnancies that are continued, in utero testing permits preparation for HCT in the neonatal period or possibly in utero (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'In utero transplantation'</a> below). Banking cord blood is suggested, either for use in future gene therapy if the infant is affected or for future transplant of an existing or potentially affected sibling if the infant is unaffected.

The risks of HCT are reduced in patients who have not yet developed infectious complications of immunodeficiency or in whom infections have been successfully treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. In one study, patients transplanted within the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) had improved survival (95 versus 76 percent) compared with those who were transplanted later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Children transplanted before 3.5 months of age also had better long-term survival rates than those transplanted after that age (94 percent versus 70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Infants receiving HCT within the first 3.5 months of age also had significantly improved T cell development. Survival at five years was high regardless of donor type among infants transplanted at &le;3.5 months of age (94 percent) and among older infants who had not yet developed infection (90 percent) or whose infections had resolved (82 percent) in a series of 240 infants with SCID who had undergone HCT at multiple North American centers participating in the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium, a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded rare disease network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Over 70 percent of state newborn screening programs in the United States are conducting newborn screening for SCID via measurement of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in dried blood spots. Infants with SCID have very low or absent TRECs and can be identified by this means prior to onset of any infections, protected with immunoglobulin and antimicrobials, and treated with allogeneic matched HCT to achieve optimal survival and immune reconstitution.

Replacement of defective HSCs through HCT permits the development of a functional immune system and may provide a complete cure for a variety of immunodeficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p>The types of primary immunodeficiency disorders that may be effectively treated with HCT are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F96738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96738 \">table 1</a>). Survival rates for some disorders are as high as 90 percent following HCT. Mortality appears to be higher in infants with natural killer-positive (NK+) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) compared with NK- SCID (survival rates of 62 versus 87 percent, respectively, in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, survival rates have continued to improve due to the availability of a large pool of matched unrelated donors, advances in the methods of preparing hosts and donor marrow, and improved supportive and adjuvant therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, excellent survival is possible with any donor type if the HCT occurs in the first 3.5 months of life or before the onset of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Early identification'</a> above.)</p><p>Most reports of HCT for primary immunodeficiency have described patients with SCID because their lack of T cell immunity means that graft rejection will not occur. This has made SCID the pioneer primary immunodeficiency for HCT, although graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains an important concern. In addition to SCID, successful outcomes have also been described with other combined immunodeficiencies (eg Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome) and disorders of phagocytic cell function (eg, chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte-adhesion deficiency). However, in these conditions, there is sufficient host cellular immunity that some form of chemotherapy conditioning is generally required to prevent graft rejection.

A matched-related-donor HCT carries the most favorable prognosis. The marrow or stem cells may be infused without any processing to remove mature cells. HLA-identical HCT results in the most rapid and complete reconstitution of immune function. The risk of histocompatibility-associated GVHD is very low (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Graft-versus-host disease'</a> below). Survival rates of 90 to 100 percent have been achieved in SCID recipients of matched-related-donor HCT performed after 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/9,10,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,15-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Matched unrelated donor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Matched unrelated donors (URDs) can be identified among registered individuals in the National Marrow Donor Program. Such matches are an increasingly available source of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-identical hematopoietic cells in the United States, particularly for Caucasians. Molecular typing by DNA sequencing of histocompatibility genes has led to better matches and a lower incidence of GVHD. Serologic typing alone has lower resolution and fails to ensure that a prospective donor and the recipient share identical HLA genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Earlier surveys suggested that survival after URD HCT was lower than HLA-identical donor HCT. Newer data suggest that the survival rates are converging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,20</a>]. As an example, one study reviewed 94 patients with SCID who underwent various types of HCT at two centers between 1990 and 2004. Survival rates of patients with URD HCT were slightly lower than those of patients with HLA-identical donors (81 and 92 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Another series of 58 patients with severe T cell deficiencies treated with different types of transplants reported a five-year survival rate of 90 percent (9 of 10) for HLA-identical transplants and 83 percent (10 of 12) for URD transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Three-year survival rates were identical in non-SCID transplanted patients with a genoidentical or URD donor (79 percent for both) transplanted in the 2000 to 2005 period in a European series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, 10-year survival was 69 percent in SCID patients with a URD compared with 90 percent in those with a genoidentical donor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mismatched related donor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another source of hematopoietic cells for transplantation in patients with SCID is HLA-mismatched related donors (MMRDs), usually parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/9,10,15,16,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,15,16,21-23</a>]. Both biologic parents have at least 50 percent identity (&quot;haploidentical&quot;) with their offspring and may be suitable donors, although the mother is usually preferred over the father because of the frequent persistence of maternally transferred lymphocytes detectable in the circulation of infants with SCID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H11755645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Non-inherited maternal HLA antigens (NIMA)'</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis following haploidentical HCT in SCID is less favorable than that with HLA-identical or URD transplants but varies from center to center. Reported survival ranges from 50 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/9,10,15-19,21,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,15-19,21,24-27</a>]. T cell function and cellular immunity recover within three to six months after transplantation with the use of T cell-depleted marrow.</p><p>There is limited published experience with families with multiple children affected by immunodeficiency in which one child received an MMRD transplant and then served as a bone marrow donor for another HLA-identical child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Early reports suggest that there may be lower rates of GVHD and more rapid immune reconstitution in the second child using this approach. The primary recipient may tolerize and functionally HLA match the original HLA-mismatched donor cells. Thus, the first sibling acts as a functionally HLA-matched donor for subsequent affected siblings.</p><p>After transplantation from HLA-nonidentical donors, patients with forms of SCID lacking B cells as well as T cells (T-B- SCID) may have a worse outcome than patients who have B cells, although this has not been observed in all series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF STEM CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three sources of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for HCT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical cord blood (UCB)</p><p/><p>Bone marrow was the original source of HSC for HCT in patients with primary immunodeficiency. Stem cells can be mobilized from bone marrow niches using agents such as the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and then harvested from peripheral blood by apheresis. HSC can be obtained in large numbers using this method, but they may be inferior to aspirated bone marrow HSC. On the other hand, peripheral mobilized HSCs contain memory T cells, a potential advantage when transplanting an infant with an active viral infection. UCB contains a relatively high concentration of HSC and can be used unmodified as a source of HSC for transplantation. One relatively large, retrospective comparison showed a similar rate of T cell engraftment and somewhat more graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients of unrelated cord blood donor HSC in comparison with mismatched-related-donor (MMRD) transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, a few mature donor T cells derived from pre-committed lymphoid progenitors generally begin to appear in the circulation after approximately three to six weeks, with larger numbers developing subsequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Mature T cells may appear even earlier, expanding two weeks after HCT in unconditioned infants with SCID who have received an unmanipulated human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical graft from a family donor that contains mature T cells. These expanding mature T cells provide some immediate immune reconstitution, even before de novo generation of T cells from donor-derived stem cells occurs. Thymic T cell output peaks one to two years after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and begins to decline thereafter. T cell reconstitution (including thymic output, clonal diversity, and T cell function) is maintained long term at levels similar or equal to normal healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Some degree of hematopoietic chimerism is common after BMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/9,15,16,21,25,43,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,16,21,25,43,56</a>]. T cells are 90 to 100 percent donor derived in almost all cases of successful HCT for SCID. One exception is patients with natural killer cell-positive (NK+) SCID, who are more likely to have mixed T cell chimerism (mean donor T cells 78 percent in one series compared with 98 percent for NK- SCID) and poorer long-term recovery of CD4+ T cell immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Myeloablation increases the rate of T cell engraftment in T cell-negative, B cell-negative (T-B-) SCID, but has less effect in T-B+ SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and may expose infants with radiation-sensitive forms of SCID to increased early toxicity and late side effects.

Pretransplant conditioning increases but does not assure the posttransplant development of B cell function. For most genetic forms of SCID, particularly X-linked gamma-c or Janus kinase (JAK)-3-deficient T-B+NK- SCID and for T-B- SCID, there is no B cell function without engraftment of donor B cells. Host B cell function is intrinsically abnormal in X-linked and JAK3-deficient SCID. However, in SCID defects limited to the T cell lineage (eg, interleukin-7 receptor [IL-7R] alpha chain deficiency; CD3 delta, epsilon, or zeta chain deficiencies; and CD45 deficiency), B cells are intrinsically normal. When helper T cells are restored by HCT, host B cells can produce protective antibodies.</p><p>B cell function may take a few years to normalize and may never be adequate enough to stop <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy, even with the presence of a significant fraction of donor B cells in the circulation.

After haploidentical HCT, the rate of reconstitution of B cell function is approximately 40 percent for T-B- SCID and 70 percent for T-B+ SCID. It is important to monitor patients individually for signs of donor B cell development. Measurements of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody synthesis and specific IgM antibodies to isohemagglutinins are informative even in patients receiving immune globulin replacement therapy. Monitoring should continue even after B cell function is adequate to stop immune globulin replacement therapy because B cell function may deteriorate after a number of years, requiring reinstitution of supplementation with immune globulin.

One study compared the quality of immune reconstitution after depletion of viable T cells from the bone marrow by either treating with anti-CD52 or selecting for CD34+ stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Relatively high T cell numbers may remain in anti-CD52 treated bone marrow. However, these T cells are destroyed by complement-mediated lysis in the recipient because they are still coated with anti-CD52 when they are infused. In comparison, fewer T cells remain after CD34+ stem cell selection, but these cells are still viable and may cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the recipient. This study found that both methods of T cell depletion lead to good long-term T cell function. The results suggest that patients in the anti-CD52 treated group have more complete B cell donor chimerism and better B cell function than the CD34+ selected group, although higher mortality was seen in the group treated with CD52-depleted grafts.</p><p>Another study had similar findings in patients with SCID who were transplanted with megadoses of haplocompatible CD34+ stem cells without myeloablative preconditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Thus, continued and progressive symptoms are observed posttransplant in these conditions.</p><p>Examples include impaired cognitive function in patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiencies, an increased rate of deafness in ADA deficiency, colitis in nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) deficiency, and motor and central neurologic impairment in Chediak-Higashi syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, patients with severe primary immunodeficiencies who had undergone HCT had lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores (85, 95% CI 81.0-90.0) than the population average (100) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. They also had lower IQ scores compared with matched siblings (90 versus 118). However, IQ deficits are more common in patients with ADA deficiency and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, conditions in which cognitive defects can be an intrinsic part of the underlying pathogenesis. In these subgroups, the mean IQ score is approximately 65.

Hematopoietic and immune reconstitution were successful. However, the child continued to have flares of colitis associated with bacterial infection because of the uncorrected NEMO defect in the intestinal epithelium. HCT also did not ameliorate the associated ectodermal dysplasia.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early diagnosis through population-wide newborn screening and early transplantation in the absence of infectious complications improve HCT outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Early identification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival rates have continued to improve with advances in the methods of preparing hosts and donor cells and in supportive and adjuvant therapies. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview of HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three sources of stem cells for HCT are bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood (UCB). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sources of stem cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In utero HCT (IUHCT) is rarely performed and may not be indicated, since neonatal HCT outcomes are excellent and unintended loss of pregnancy is possible with IUHCT. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'In utero transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications following HCT include infections, graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. The incidence of these adverse events varies with the type of HCT and underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Complications before and after HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymic T cell output is restored following HCT for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and peaks in one to two years. Recovery of B cell function is less consistent after HCT and does not occur in a substantial fraction of patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Reconstitution of immune function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term prognosis of HCT for primary immunodeficiency has improved, but challenges remain. HCT in children with severe primary immunodeficiencies may predispose to decreased neurocognitive function and behavioral abnormalities. In addition, HCT does not correct associated nonhematopoietic abnormalities in primary immunodeficiencies in which expression of the defective gene is not restricted to the immune system.
