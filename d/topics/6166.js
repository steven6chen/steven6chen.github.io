They persist as a function of the acid or peptic activity in gastric juice. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is an important cause of morbidity and health care costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The natural history of peptic ulcer ranges from resolution without intervention to the development of complications with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality, such as bleeding and perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of peptic ulcer disease is a reflection of the changing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, the increasing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the aging population. Ulcer disease has been decreasing in prevalence since the 1900s and these changes in ulcer prevalence preceded the discovery of Helicobacter pylori. </p><p>This dramatic shift in pattern of ulcer disease and of <em>H. pylori</em>-induced gastritis appeared to reflect environmental factors, which changed markedly during this period, rather than genetic bacterial or host factors, which appeared unchanged. One theory suggests that during the early 1900s improved transportation and refrigeration decreased the need for food preservatives and supported a rapid change in diet across the emerging developed nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most evident change was from a seasonal diet, in which salt was used as a preservative, to a diet with fresh fruits and vegetables available all year. Furthermore, improved hygiene and overall health in developed countered was associated with reduced rates of childhood infections, which may decrease susceptibility to the pangastritic spread of <em>H. pylori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In developing nations, the majority of children are infected with <em>H. pylori</em> before the age of 10 and adult prevalence peaks at more than 80 percent before age 50. In contrast, in developed countries such as the United States, serologic evidence of <em>H. pylori</em> is uncommon before age 10, increasing to 10 percent in those between 18 and 30 years of age, and to 50 percent in those older than age 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Another systematic review found that the incidence of uncomplicated peptic ulcer was approximately one case per 1000 person-years in the general population, and that the incidence of ulcer complications was approximately 0.7 cases per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The pooled incidence rates for uncomplicated DUs and GUs were comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rates for bleeding from GUs and DUs were also comparable (0.019 and 0.024, respectively). In contrast, incidence rates for perforated DUs were higher as compared with perforated GUs (0.0055 and 0.0014 percent, respectively).</p><p>Ulcer incidence increases with age for both DUs and GUs, but DUs emerge two decades earlier than GUs, particularly in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The incidence of uncomplicated PUD reached a plateau with age, whereas for complicated PUD incidence increased exponentially with age.</p><p>The disease burden varies based upon the presence of <em>H. pylori</em>. The ulcer incidence in <em>H. pylori</em>-infected individuals is about 1 percent per year, a rate that is 6- to 10-fold higher than for uninfected subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

A study in the United States reported an endoscopic point prevalence for peptic ulcers in asymptomatic, <em>H. pylori</em>-positive adults of 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other studies, in presumably asymptomatic subjects in whom <em>H. pylori</em> status was unknown, have reported an endoscopic point prevalence ranging from 1 and 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. This rate is 4 to 10 times that found in <em>H. pylori</em>-negative subjects, but careful comparative studies have not been reported. Several factors contribute to this variability, such as the endoscopic criteria of an ulcer diagnosis, the assessment and criteria for symptoms, the population, and sampling methods. Much higher rates are found in countries where <em>H. pylori</em> infection is higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>The lifetime prevalence is also higher in <em>H. pylori</em>-positive subjects (approximately 10 to 20 percent compared to 5 to 10 percent in the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>].</p><p>Endoscopic studies in populations provide an estimate of the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic ulcer disease in the community. Two studies were from Europe and reported a 2 percent prevalence of gastric ulcer in Europe and 6.1 percent in China. Duodenal ulcer was found in 2.1 percent of subjects in Sweden and 3.9 percent in Italy. In China, the prevalence of duodenal ulcer was 13.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/13,14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Time trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several prominent trends are evident. Peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer have been steadily falling over the past several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. For example, in the United Kingdom, a population-based cohort study indicated a fall in uncomplicated peptic ulcer from 0.11 to 0.052 percent per patient-year between 1997 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rates of DUs have fallen more dramatically than for GUs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These trends contrast with the increase in esophagitis and esophageal and cardiac adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In Asia, declines in the incidence of both GUs and DUs have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>The overall ulcer complication rates are also falling in developed countries. The fall in complication rates lagged decreases in incidence of uncomplicated PUD because of different patterns in subpopulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For example, peptic ulcer hemorrhage and perforation rapidly declined in younger individuals but have been relatively stable in older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The occurrence of peptic ulcer in Western countries appears to have shifted over the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from being a disease predominant in males to one with a nearly comparable prevalence in both sexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. For example, the pooled relative risk for uncomplicated PUD in men versus women was 2.0 before and 1.3 after 1995. In contrast, the relative risk for males versus females for PUD bleeding fell only from 2.4 to 2.1 before and after 1995. These trends are less evident in Asian countries, where DUs still appear to be predominant in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>These overall trends are due to the interplay of several factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of <em>H. pylori</em> in patients younger than 60 years is falling dramatically in developed countries due in part to improved hygiene and socioeconomic conditions starting after World War II. However, the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection remains high for older individuals and in certain predisposed subpopulations. The decline in <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence is one clear factor accounting for the fall in peptic ulcer prevalence in the developed countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacteriology-and-epidemiology-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacteriology and epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAID use increases as a function of age and is an independent risk factor for ulcers. In addition, older subjects are more likely to develop complications from NSAID ulcers and to suffer increased morbidity and mortality from these complications because of comorbidities. Increased NSAID use, especially in the elderly, opposed the fall in <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence, and probably accounted for slower decline in rates of peptic ulcer complications during the past three decades. One can speculate that more judicious use of NSAIDs and possibly measures to ameliorate risk, such as PPI co-therapy or use of COX-2 inhibitors, are finally attenuating ulcer complication rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking clearly exacerbates at least <em>H. pylori</em> associated ulcer disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;</a>.) The decline in smoking in younger individuals, particularly males, and increase in women, may be a factor in the declining <span class=\"nowrap\">male/female</span> ratio of ulcer disease. Smoking does not appear to be a factor in the ulcer complications found in older women or in NSAID-related ulcers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors, such as the extreme psychological stress associated with traumatic events, are associated with a transient increase in ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Unfortunately, there are limited population-based studies to support firm conclusions. A few examples of the available data follow.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> is similar in south and north China. However, review of endoscopic and case records over a 10 year period to identify cases of confirmed duodenal and gastric ulcer and gastric cancer revealed that DU rates were 2.4 times as common in southern as compared to northern China. GU was also more common in southern, compared to northern regions of China, whereas gastric cancer rates were 1.6 times more common in northern regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar pattern between the north and south of India has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A review of 20,053 records from patients undergoing endoscopy for dyspepsia and a prospective study of 590 endoscopy patients confirmed these patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Furthermore, an endoscopic, population-based survey found 12:1 predominance of DUs over GUs in from a supposedly low ulcer prevalence region of northern region of India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These findings support the existence of regional differences in the pattern of ulcer disease in India.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In South Africa, hospital admission rates suggest that the prevalence of DUs is much lower in rural areas, compared to cities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 13-year review of all surgical procedures for peptic ulcer complications at a Nigerian hospital found that obstruction was the most common complication (56 percent), followed by perforation (30 percent) and bleeding (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Patterns of NSAID use and smoking are likely to be important. Some regional differences probably relate to the pattern of <em>H. pylori</em>-associated gastritis occurring in different regions. Diet has also been hypothesized to account for regional differences (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is associated with two major factors: <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection; and the consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are reviewed here briefly and are discussed in greater detail on corresponding topic reviews (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79691\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79691 \">table 1</a>). There are also a number of other defined mechanisms for peptic ulcer disease that are much less common but becoming more evident as the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> declines in developed countries (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unusual causes of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>).</p><p>Two points are of critical importance in both discussing causes and in evaluating patients with peptic ulcers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>H. pylori</em> can be difficult to diagnose in some patients; false-negative testing is an important consideration. False negative serologic tests occur in at least 10 percent of patients. False negative results are common following use of antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and bismuth in tests that depend upon the bacterial load of <em>H. pylori</em>. Similarly, acute gastrointestinal bleeding decreases sensitivity of urease testing.

In regions such as Southern Europe and Japan, where prevalence rates for <em>H. pylori</em> in both gastric ulcers (GU) and duodenal ulcers (DU) have been over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], there is evidence of decreasing <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence in the population and in peptic ulcer, especially in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In regions where this trend is more mature, such as the United States and parts of Europe, the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> in PUD (with NSAID use excluded) now ranges from 50 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. A study evaluating time trends of H. pylori infection in China and the United States found that sero-prevalence rates for H. pylori infection have stabilized in the United States while they continue to fall in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>Low reinfection rates after <em>H. pylori</em> cure also mirror the falling <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence.

Individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, for example, have higher rates of <em>H. pylori</em> infection and much higher rates of <em>H. pylori</em> recurrence after triple drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, impoverished inner city and rural populations generally have much higher <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence, although this situation also appears to be changing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As an example, the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> and peptic ulcer at one institution in West Virginia fell over an 11-year period from 66 percent in 263 patients to 7 percent in 251 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In parallel, peptic ulcer prevalence at endoscopy fell from 39 to 6 percent. Although several factors may have influenced this trend, such as pre-endoscopy treatment of <em>H. pylori</em> and use of antisecretory agents, a substantial decrease in the prevalence of both <em>H. pylori</em> and peptic ulcer is likely even in rural populations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">NSAIDs, including aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease.

Other risk factors are the dose; duration of action; duration of therapy of the NSAIDs; advanced age of the patient (generally above 75 years); co-therapy with drugs that enhance toxicity, and comorbidity, especially with cardiovascular disease. Genetic predisposition due to polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2C9 may delay the metabolism of several NSAIDs, with a prolonged duration of drug enhancing the ulcerogenic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The risk of gastrointestinal complications increases with time but the risk is highest in the early treatment period among those first starting NSAIDs.

In one report, bleeding times when initially tested were similar in 61 patients with prior GI bleeding compared to 61 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, 375 mg of aspirin induced an exaggerated prolongation of bleeding time in about 30 percent of patients with a prior history of GI bleeding, compared to only 9 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interactions of NSAIDs with other drugs are critical factors influencing the risk from NSAIDs. Co-therapy of NSAIDs with steroids, anticoagulants, other NSAIDs, low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> dramatically increase the risk of ulcer complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Clopidogrel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anti-platelet agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> was associated with a 12 month rebleeding rate of 8.6 percent, compared to 0.7 percent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus a PPI in a study of high-risk patients with a prior history of GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, clopidogrel is contraindicated in high risk patients when used alone or in combination with NSAIDs. Any anti-platelet agent should be prescribed with caution in patients at risk for ulcer complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">COX-2 inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controlled trials with COX-2 selective inhibitors have demonstrated a reduction in risk of clinical peptic ulcers and their complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Even though COX-2 inhibitors may have a reduced risk compared to traditional NSAIDs, the risk is increased compared with placebo. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-inhibitors-and-gastroduodenal-toxicity-major-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 inhibitors and gastroduodenal toxicity: Major clinical trials&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of a PPI with a COX-2 inhibitor does appear to largely reverse ulcerogenic effects, evident by findings that patients who are at high risk for ulcer complications and require NSAIDS have markedly reduced complication rates when maintained on a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence that COX-2 inhibitors alone have advantages over other NSAIDs for patients with unhealed ulcers or during ulcer healing. Since COX-2 inhibitors appear to inhibit healing of peptic ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], they are not an attractive alternative for patients with active peptic ulcer disease. Therefore, NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitor, should be stopped during the healing treatment of peptic ulcer. After the healing phase of treatment, if NSAIDs are required, a COX-2 inhibitor should be used in combination with a PPI.</p><p>Another important point is that low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> has synergistic effects, exacerbating the risk of GI complications caused by both NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.) Co-therapy of low dose aspirin with COX-2 inhibitors, and with at least some nonselective NSAIDs, also attenuates the cardiovascular protective effects of the aspirin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">NSAID-H. pylori synergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interaction between NSAIDs and <em>H. pylori</em> is controversial and complex (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>). The confusion is not surprising because <em>H. pylori</em> causes a spectrum of gastric consequences ranging from antral-predominant gastritis with robust acid secretion that predisposes to duodenal ulcer formation, to pangastritis with achlorhydria, where the peptic ulcer risk is nil. Patients with <em>H. pylori</em> and low acid secretion may be protected, whereas the subset with active or subclinical ulcer disease would be at high risk from NSAID complications. As noted, 1 to 4 percent of asymptomatic <em>H. pylori</em> positive subjects without an ulcer history have silent peptic ulcers evident at surveillance endoscopy; presumably this is the group that would be at the highest risk with exposure to NSAIDs.</p><p>Two meta-analyses of case-controlled studies have found synergism between <em>H. pylori</em> and NSAIDs in producing both peptic ulcer and ulcer bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Such studies establish an association, but not causality. Much more convincing evidence for the impact of <em>H. pylori</em> on NSAID-induced ulcer formation and complications comes from controlled trials studying primary prevention in which patients who required NSAIDs and were <em>H. pylori</em> positive were randomized before starting NSAIDs to an active or placebo <em>H. pylori</em> eradication treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. The first trial treated all patients with NSAIDs for eight weeks; endoscopic ulcers were found in 26 percent of patients with persistent <em>H. pylori</em> and 3 percent with successful eradication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A second trial entered a higher risk group with a history of dyspepsia or prior ulcer and followed them for six months on NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Endoscopic ulcers were found in 34 percent of the control group compared to 12 percent of the eradication group; importantly, complicated ulcers were reduced from 27 percent in the control group to 4 percent in the eradication group. </p><p>In contrast to these studies with NSAID-na&iuml;ve patients, curing <em>H. pylori</em> in patients who are already taking NSAIDs has much less benefit for reducing endoscopic ulceration and ulcer complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In one controlled trial, <em>H. pylori</em> positive patients with a history of prior NSAID-associated ulcer bleeding were randomized to eradication or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> treatment. During the subsequent six months of treatment with conventional NSAIDs, complications occurred in 24 percent in patients randomized to eradication therapy versus 4 percent in patients treated with continuous PPI co-therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Other studies confirm that ulcer recurrence rates upon resuming NSAIDs are higher with <em>H. pylori </em>cure alone compared to PPI co-therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p>Although available data are conflicting, the situation may be different for low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. The study referenced above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>] also included patients with a prior ulcer bleed who were treated with low dose aspirin for six months following <em>H. pylori</em> eradication; recurrent bleeding occurred in 1.9 percent of this group compared to 0.9 percent in patients also treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> co-therapy. However, another similar study found a considerably higher recurrent ulcer complication rate during low dose aspirin treatment with <em>H. pylori</em> eradication alone compared with a group also treated with PPI co-therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, interpretation of this study is limited because, of the nine patients with recurrent complications following eradication treatment, four still had <em>H. pylori</em> infection and two were using other NSAIDs.</p><p>Four consensus panels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/69-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-72</a>] have interpreted available data as convincing evidence for <em>H. pylori</em>-NSAID synergy and for the importance of testing and treating <em>H. pylori</em> before starting NSAIDs at least in high risk patients, such as older patients, those with serious comorbidity, dyspepsia, or a history of prior ulcer disease. Even though there are no definitive studies directly testing primary prevention for low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, similar synergy with <em>H. pylori</em> in inducing complicated ulcers and benefit from curing <em>H. pylori</em> before starting aspirin can be anticipated. Since there are several potential benefits to curing <em>H. pylori</em> infection, we favor testing for and treating <em>H. pylori</em> or at least offering patients this option before initiating NSAIDs or low-dose aspirin. A systematic review of aspirin studies confirms the benefit of H pylori eradication in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Despite the benefits of curing <em>H. pylori </em>before starting NSAID or low dose aspirin treatment, high risk patients still warrant measures to reduce risk, as considered elsewhere in detail.

There are also a number of other defined mechanisms for peptic ulcer that are much less common but becoming more evident as the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> declines in developed countries (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unusual causes of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates of the annual incidence of peptic ulcer range from 0.1 to 0.3 percent. The ulcer incidence in <em>H. pylori</em>-infected individuals is about 1 percent per year, a rate that is 6- to 10-fold higher than for uninfected subjects. Ulcer incidence increases with age for both duodenal and gastric ulcers. The prevalence of peptic ulcer in Western countries appears to have shifted over the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from being a disease predominant in males to one with a nearly comparable prevalence in both sexes. This pattern may not apply to Asian countries, where duodenal ulcers may still be predominant in males. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The trends in peptic ulcer mortality in Europe and the United States followed a birth-cohort phenomenon. Mortality was highest in people born in the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and has fallen steadily in the generations born since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The decline in <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence over the 20<sup>th</sup> century is a major factor underlying the fall in ulcer prevalence and mortality. However, other still undefined factors are also at play. In light of these longer range trends, rates of hospitalization and death from peptic ulcer, emergency admissions for ulcer complications do appear to be falling after having been relatively stable for the past two decades. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Time trends'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even within a generally low prevalence region, <em>H. pylori</em> infection and its complications remain somewhat higher in certain predisposed populations, such as impoverished inner city populations, and in individuals whose hygiene and self-care are compromised by factors such as intellectual or developmental disabilities. Reinfection is also likely to be higher in such populations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several factors predict increased risk with NSAIDs, such as <em>H. pylori </em>infection, advanced age, comorbidities, and co-therapy with drugs such as corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and bisphosphonates. Evidence especially in na&iuml;ve NSAID or low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> users indicates synergy with <em>H. pylori</em> and justifies testing for <em>H. pylori</em> before first starting NSAIDs or low dose aspirin treatment.
