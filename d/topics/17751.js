The Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (as well as a third intermediate form) are caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene and are therefore named dystrophinopathies. Weakness is the principal symptom as muscle fiber degeneration is the primary pathologic process.</p><p/><p>The dystrophinopathies are inherited as X-linked recessive traits and have varying clinical characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with the most severe clinical symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has a similar presentation to DMD but a relatively milder clinical course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intermediate group of patients, known as &quot;outliers,&quot; may be classified clinically as having either mild DMD or severe BMD.</p><p/><p>The management and treatment of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy will be discussed in this review. The genetics, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of the Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are reviewed separately.

The evidence establishing the benefit of glucocorticoid therapy for improving motor function, pulmonary function, and reducing the risk of scoliosis is presented in the sections that follow. (See <a href=\"#H1366719011\" class=\"local\">'Beneficial effects'</a> below.)</p><p>Our recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy are in accord with national and expert consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with DMD age four years or older whose motor skills have plateaued or declined, we recommend treatment with glucocorticoids using either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deflazacort-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">deflazacort</a>. We prefer prednisone (0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per week given over two weekend days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deflazacort-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">deflazacort</a> (0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) can be used. Deflazacort is an oxazoline derivative of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, and has an estimated dosage equivalency of 1:1.3 compared with prednisone. Thus, 1.3 mg of deflazacort is approximately equivalent to 1.0 mg of prednisone. Deflazacort was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is available in Canada via the Special Access Programme (SAP), which provides access to nonmarketed drugs for practitioners treating patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable. Deflazacort is also available as a licensed pharmaceutical in some European, Asian, and South American countries. Some experts routinely use deflazacort for DMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and believe it offers a more favorable side effect profile than daily treatment with prednisone, particularly with regard to weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Prednisone versus deflazacort'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefits and side effects of glucocorticoid therapy must be monitored. Timed muscle function tests, pulmonary function tests, and age at loss of independent ambulation are useful parameters to assess benefits. Potential side effects include weight gain, excessive hair growth, cushingoid appearance, short stature, decrease in linear growth, delayed puberty, long bone and vertebral fractures, acne, gastrointestinal symptoms, cataracts, and behavioral changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1622188952\" class=\"local\">'Orthopedic outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining the glucocorticoid dose is optimal if side effects are tolerable and manageable. The glucocorticoid dose can be reduced by 25 to 35 percent if the side effects are intolerable or unmanageable, with reassessment in one month. The dose can be lowered by an additional 25 percent if intolerable side effects persist. A gradual tapering of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> to as low as 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day may give significant but less robust benefit. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of significant obesity or intolerable side effects, glucocorticoids should be continued even for patients who become nonambulatory because treatment may slow or delay the development of scoliosis, pulmonary function decline, and heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest preventive measures to minimize bone loss for patients with DMD who are receiving prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. Such measures include dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and yearly dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning and a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. (See <a href=\"#H258480619\" class=\"local\">'Bone health'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The mechanism of the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in patients with DMD is not clear.

In a randomized controlled trial of 196 boys with DMD, subjects assigned to prednisone (0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) had greater mean weight gain at 12 and 52 weeks compared with subjects assigned to either of two deflazacort doses (0.9 and 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similarly, another trial of 18 patients found that deflazacort treatment was associated with a lesser increase in body weight than prednisone treatment at 12 months (2 versus 5 kg), though there was no significant difference in weight gain with longer-term treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].
