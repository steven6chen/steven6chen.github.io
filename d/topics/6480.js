Testing for renal artery stenosis is <strong>only</strong> indicated if a corrective procedure would be performed if clinically significant renovascular disease were detected.

However, a variety of less invasive tests has been evaluated for testing purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The following noninvasive tests are reasonable alternatives for initial testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duplex Doppler ultrasonography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomographic angiography (CTA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)</p><p/><p>The choice of test should be based upon institutional expertise and patient factors (see <a href=\"#H16699595\" class=\"local\">'Selecting a diagnostic test'</a> below). If the noninvasive test is inconclusive and the clinical suspicion remains high, conventional renal arteriography is recommended.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Captopril</a> renal scintigraphy (renography), selective renal vein renin measurements, and plasma renin activity (in isolation or after captopril administration) are <strong>not</strong> useful as initial diagnostic tests for renal artery stenosis, although renography is useful to determine the relative function of each kidney. (See <a href=\"#H16699536\" class=\"local\">'Tests of limited utility, but occasionally performed'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16699492\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplex Doppler ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex Doppler ultrasonography primarily provides functional assessment of the renal arteries, as well as some anatomic information. Direct visualization of the main renal arteries (B-mode imaging) is combined with measurement (via Doppler) of a variety of hemodynamic factors. Stenotic lesions can be detected by comparing the systolic flow velocity in the renal artery to that in the aorta since the velocity of flow increases as an artery narrows; end-diastolic velocity also may be increased distal to a stenotic lesion.</p><p>Duplex Doppler ultrasonography can detect both unilateral and bilateral disease. It is relatively inexpensive and suitable for serial measurements to determine disease progression. This modality can also be used to detect recurrent stenosis in patients previously treated with angioplasty or surgery.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 88 studies involving 9974 arteries and 8147 patients assessed the ability of the various duplex ultrasonography parameters to detect renal artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of these parameters, peak systolic velocity, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 92 percent, respectively, was more accurate than the renal-aortic ratio and acceleration index. The positive predictive value was 84 percent and the false positive rate was 8 percent.</p><p>There are, however, two important <strong>disadvantages</strong> of duplex Doppler ultrasonography:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is time consuming (taking up to two hours to perform).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is technically difficult (particularly in large patients), has a steep learning curve, and is operator dependent.</p><p/><p>As with many diagnostic procedures, <strong>a positive test is more informative than a negative test</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16699507\"><span class=\"h3\">Resistive index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When added to duplex Doppler ultrasonography, calculation of the renal resistive index ([peak systolic velocity - end-diastolic velocity] divided by peak systolic velocity) may, in the hands of experienced operators, improve the ability to predict the outcome after revascularization. In general, a higher resistive index is associated with a greater degree of intrinsic renal damage (ie, likely irreversible small vessel injury) and, therefore, a diminished predicted benefit from revascularization.</p><p>The utility of the resistive index was evaluated in a study of almost 6000 patients with hypertension and clinical features suggestive of atherosclerotic renovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The following findings were noted in the 131 patients who had renal artery stenosis and underwent technically successful angioplasty, primarily without stent placement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes were poor among the 35 patients with a resistive index above 80. Renal function declined during follow-up in 80 percent of these patients, nearly one-half became dialysis dependent, and only one experienced a blood pressure reduction of &ge;10 mmHg. Thus, a high resistance index may indicate irreversible intrarenal vascular disease or arteriosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes were better among the 96 patients with a resistive index less than 80. There was a significant fall in blood pressure in 94 percent, while renal function worsened in only 3 percent. These patients had significantly better baseline kidney function than those with a higher resistance index (creatinine clearance 68 versus 33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> and were less likely to have a history of severe atherosclerosis (54 versus 83 percent).</p><p/><p>Although similar findings have been found in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], this marked difference in outcomes according to the resistive index was <strong>not</strong> replicated in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In addition, determination of the resistive index is operator dependent and can be obscured by patient factors such as obesity. Thus, it is <strong>not</strong>, by itself, a broadly useful parameter for predicting the outcome after revascularization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16699522\"><span class=\"h2\">Spiral CT scan with CT angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spiral (helical) computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast injection (called CT angiography, or CTA) is a highly accurate noninvasive diagnostic test for imaging renovascular disease due to atherosclerosis but less so for fibromuscular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100710\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100710 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CT angiography combines the diagnostic accuracy of arteriography with the low risk of intravenous digital subtraction angiography. Multidetector, spiral CTA continues to evolve technically and has been reported to provide excellent sensitivity (96 percent) and specificity (97 percent) in small groups of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>].</p><p>The performance of CTA was less favorable in a larger series of 356 hypertensive patients, of whom 72 patients (20 percent) had some degree of renal artery stenosis (defined as a 50 percent or greater stenosis detected by digital subtraction angiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of CTA were 64 and 92 percent, respectively. However, the poor sensitivity of CTA in this study was probably due to the high proportion of patients who had fibromuscular dysplasia (36 percent of those with renal artery stenosis) since fibromuscular disease usually involves distal arterial segments that are more difficult to image. (See <a href=\"#H282253371\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive imaging is less reliable in fibromuscular dysplasia'</a> below.)</p><p>Rapid developments in CT imaging with improved tissue reconstruction, multidetector slice acquisition, and higher resolution with less contrast exposure continue to improve the value of CT angiography as a diagnostic tool for renovascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16699529\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can provide excellent vascular imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100711\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100711 \">image 3</a>), concerns about gadolinium-associated complications including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis have greatly reduced its application for renovascular disease, primarily in patients with reduced kidney function. The level of glomerular filtration rate below which MRA should be avoided is discussed below.

Using arteriography as the gold standard, MRA had a sensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 96 percent (one false positive) for the detection of stenosis of the main renal arteries. However, MRA missed stenosis in 9 of 12 accessory renal arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in another report of 30 patients: sensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 71 percent for proximal renal artery stenoses of more than 50 or 75 percent occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Technical improvements in MRA, including imaging without the use of gadolinium-based contrast, have enhanced the detection of significant renal artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. As an example, the use of breath-hold MRA with paramagnetic contrast material such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadopentetate-dimeglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadopentetate dimeglumine</a> substantially improves the ability to visualize some (but not all) accessory arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], while phase-contrast MRA produces results similar to digital subtraction angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In one report of 87 renal arteries, 20 of which had a stenosis, the sensitivity and specificity of breath-hold MRA for renal artery stenosis were 100 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282253371\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive imaging is less reliable in fibromuscular dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of a false negative result from noninvasive imaging is much more likely to occur in patients with stenotic lesions that involve the intrarenal portion of the renal artery.

MAG3 may be more reliable in patients with renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The efficacy of this test is based upon the expected ACE inhibitor-induced decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the stenotic kidney, often accompanied by an increase in GFR in the contralateral kidney due to removal of angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction. The net effect is that the difference between the two kidneys is enhanced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of the ACE inhibitor scan vary substantially in different studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>], and have limited interobserver agreement and a poor correlation with the benefit obtained from angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. An additional problem is the high prevalence of baseline asymmetry of renal blood flow, particularly in patients with a reduced glomerular filtration rate. In a study of 148 patients with primary hypertension, for example, one-half of patients had a greater than 25 percent difference in renal blood flow between the two kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>As a result of these limitations, we use radionuclide renography primarily to determine the relative function of each kidney.

Thus, the presence of highly discrepant (or lateralizing) renal renin values should indicate the presence of physiologically significant renal artery stenosis. The accuracy of these measurements may be enhanced by the prior administration of an ACE inhibitor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diuretics, which will increase renin secretion on the affected side.</p><p>However, the use of renal vein renin measurements to diagnose clinically significant renovascular disease produces many false negative and occasional false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension/abstract/33,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,37</a>].
