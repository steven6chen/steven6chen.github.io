In the United States, breast cancer is the most common female cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in women, and the main cause of death in women ages 40 to 49 years. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous, phenotypically diverse disease composed of several biologic subtypes that have distinct behavior and response to therapy. Hormone receptor-positive (ie, estrogen [ER] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone [PR] receptor-positive) breast cancers comprise the most common types of breast cancer, accounting for 75 percent of all cases.</p><p>This topic will review adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer occurring in women.

Therefore, there is wide consensus that these patients should receive adjuvant endocrine therapy.</p><p>The agents used in this setting are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H1589893280\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian suppression or ablation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H658246\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to treatment decisions for women with non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is outlined below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2087745540\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the endocrine options for treatment depend on whether or not a woman is in menopause, defining menopausal status is important. For women with breast cancer who were premenopausal at diagnosis, particularly those treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, amenorrhea is not a reliable indicator of menstrual status. We agree with the following definitions of menopause used by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We consider women 60 years and older postmenopausal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We consider women less than 60 years postmenopausal if one of the following conditions is met:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They previously underwent a bilateral oophorectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They have not had any menstrual periods for 12 months or more in the absence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, chemotherapy, or ovarian suppression, and the serum estradiol is in the postmenopausal range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They are amenorrheic on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and serum estradiol are in the postmenopausal range.</p><p/><p>For women who were premenopausal prior to chemotherapy but experience therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurement of FSH and estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status if considering initiation of an aromatase inhibitor (AI). It is our practice to utilize an ultrasensitive estradiol assay for monitoring reactivation of ovarian function. (See <a href=\"#H1990594858\" class=\"local\">'Reactivation of ovarian function'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H658260\"><span class=\"h2\">Premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women who do not meet the definition of menopause should be treated as premenopausal patients. For these patients, we base decisions regarding adjuvant endocrine therapy on whether a patient has a sufficiently high risk of recurrence:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2087745635\"><span class=\"h3\">High-risk features present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with high-risk breast cancer, we offer ovarian suppression plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exemestane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exemestane</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> as single-agent therapy. This recommendation is based on the results of the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) and the Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT), both of which are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1589893292\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>While formal criteria to define such risk are not present, a reasonable definition would include patients in whom chemotherapy is indicated, such as patients with the presence of pathologically involved lymph nodes, large tumor size, high tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high risk of recurrence based on a genomic assay (eg, Recurrence Score [RS] &gt;31 on the 21-gene recurrence assay). In addition, we would also consider women at a younger age (ie, age &le;35 years) at a higher risk of recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2087745658\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk features not present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who appear to not be at a high risk of recurrence, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> as single-agent therapy. Treatment appears to be sufficient and spares women from the toxicities associated with ovarian suppression plus endocrine therapy. Historically, a course of five years of tamoxifen was recommended. However, extended treatment to ten years should be offered to all patients, which is consistent with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>An aromatase inhibitor (AI) is not appropriate as single-agent therapy for women with intact ovarian function. This includes premenopausal women who became amenorrheic as a result of adjuvant chemotherapy (ie, chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea) because they may have return of ovarian function during follow-up or may experience reactivation of ovarian function on an AI. (See <a href=\"#H1990594858\" class=\"local\">'Reactivation of ovarian function'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97279110\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most women with postmenopausal breast cancer, we administer an AI rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. While AIs are associated with improved outcomes compared with tamoxifen, both agents reduce recurrences and new primary breast cancers, and some women may tolerate the risks and toxicities of tamoxifen better than an AI. For women who wish to discontinue an AI, it would be reasonable to switch to tamoxifen. The duration of endocrine therapy is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H38114838\" class=\"local\">'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, all postmenopausal women who are candidates for endocrine therapy should be offered treatment, regardless of age. While the odds of having associated medical comorbidities increase with age, and these may predispose older women to increased toxicities related to treatment, the benefits of adjuvant endocrine therapy on reducing the risks of recurrence and death from breast cancer have been consistently demonstrated. Therefore, patients at risk for treatment-related toxicities due to adjuvant endocrine therapy should be managed appropriately, with care coordinated between their oncology team and primary care clinician.

Temporary amenorrhea is also possible with the administration of pharmacologic interventions to induce ovarian suppression, such as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Multiple trials have evaluated their role in the treatment of premenopausal breast cancer patients in addition to other endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and as a sole agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1589893292\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3341490109\"><span class=\"h3\">Average-risk premenopausal patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ovarian suppression with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> or aromatase inhibition<em> </em>does not provide a significant benefit over tamoxifen alone for most premenopausal patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>In the Suppression of Ovarian Function (SOFT) trial, over 3000 premenopausal women were randomly assigned to one of three arms: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> alone, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exemestane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exemestane</a> plus ovarian suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, a transition from tamoxifen to an AI should only be made if the patient has clinical and biochemical evidence of menopause (postmenopausal levels of follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol, as measured by ultrasensitive assay). If the transition to AIs is made for such women in their 40s or early 50s, we continue to monitor with ultrasensitive estradiol monthly for at least the succeeding six months to ensure levels remain suppressed. Clinical monitoring of menses is insufficient given that women may be amenorrheic and still have biochemical recovery of ovarian function, leading to worse disease outcomes on AIs.</p><p>The risk of recovering ovarian function with AI treatment appears to be age related, although it has been observed even in women in their early 50s. In one study of 45 patients, recovery of ovarian function (as determined by resumption of menses or premenopausal estradiol levels according to ultrasensitive assay) was observed in 29 percent of subjects, ranging between age 40 and 56 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Median age at chemotherapy initiation was lower among patients who regained ovarian function compared with those who did not (43 versus 49 years, respectively).

Therefore, no one AI is preferred over another. As an example, in the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) MA.27 study, over 7500 women were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exemestane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exemestane</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Of note, 32 and 29 percent discontinued exemestane and anastrozole, respectively, during the study as a result of adverse events, concomitant illness, or study refusal. The implications of poor compliance on survival outcomes for women on endocrine therapy are an area of active investigation.

Extended adjuvant endocrine therapy beyond five years is an option for all patients with a prior history of invasive, ER-positive breast cancer, but some patients may be more likely to derive benefit than others. For women with larger tumors or node-positive disease, unless there is a contraindication to extended endocrine therapy (such as prior thrombosis on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> or osteoporosis refractory to bone-modifying agents), we suggest extended endocrine treatment. For women with smaller, node-negative tumors, the benefits are less clear and, for some, may not outweigh the risk of toxicities. A patient-by-patient decision must be made that includes risk of both ongoing symptomatic side effects and life-taking, -threatening, or -changing toxicities, such as thrombosis and endometrial cancer (both with tamoxifen), or fracture or cardiovascular disease (with AIs).</p><p>Observational data suggest that the risk of distant recurrence after five years of adjuvant endocrine treatment continues steadily for at least the subsequent 15 years. In a meta-analysis of 88 trials that included 62,923 women with ER-positive breast cancer who were disease free after five years of scheduled endocrine therapy, the risk of recurrence correlated strongly with the original lymph node status, tumor size, and grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Those with many positive nodes were at an annual risk of distant recurrence of nearly 3 percent per year; for those with one to three positive nodes, the annual risk was approximately 2 percent; for those with negative nodes but T2 or greater lesions, the risk is approximately 1 percent per year; and women with node-negative and smaller tumors experienced an annual risk of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent. </p><p>Retrospective evaluations of several adjuvant endocrine trials incorporating multiparameter gene and protein expression assays have suggested that such assays may identify patients who have such a favorable prognosis that extended endocrine therapy be unlikely to benefit. However, further study is necessary before routine clinical use of such tools in determining who should receive extended endocrine treatment. As an example of one such study, the TransATAC trial evaluated the ability of various genomic signatures in identifying patients at risk for late recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. While it appeared that all assays were effective at identifying node-negative patients at low risk for late recurrence, models integrating clinical information with genomic data (ie, PAM50 and Endopredict) were more effective at identifying node-positive disease at low risk for recurrence than assays relying on genomics only (ie, Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score or Breast Cancer Index). Other preliminary data support the Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years (CTS5), which relies on nodal status, tumor size and grade, and age, as a tool to guide the use of extended therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, none of these has been well validated in other data sets, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Tumor Marker Guidelines for Early Breast Cancer Panel has not recommended using any of these to guide the decision about extended endocrine therapy at this time.

Among approximately 1900 postmenopausal women who had completed 4.5 to 6 years of therapy with an AI (with a median duration of prior tamoxifen of five years), letrozole for an additional five years improved five-year DFS relative to those who received placebo (95 percent [95% CI 93 to 96 percent] versus 91 percent [95% CI 89 to 93 percent]). Nearly half of the events were new primary cancers. In this regard, the annual rate of contralateral breast cancer was reduced with letrozole (0.21 versus 0.49 percent; HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.81). Bone-related toxic effects were more frequent among those receiving letrozole, including bone pain (18 versus 14 percent), fractures (14 versus 9 percent), and new-onset osteoporosis (11 versus 6 percent).

The difference in results between these trials may be due to a difference in how they defined recurrence-free survival; for example, with MA17R including only recurrences of the original breast cancer or a new breast cancer and NSABP-B42 also including new nonbreast primary cancer and death from any cause. In both studies, the breast cancer-free interval was similarly defined, and showed a small but statistically significant improvement with extended endocrine therapy.
