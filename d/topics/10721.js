The etiologic agents in human GN are largely unknown with the exception of infections, such as beta-hemolytic streptococci in poststreptococcal GN and hepatitis C virus in cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative GN, drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The nature of the immune responses which lead to GN and the individuals who develop them are strongly influenced by immunogenetic phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Glomerular injury of immune origin is mediated by the actions of multiple elements of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in diverse clinical and pathologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, elements of the complement cascade and the complement regulatory systems can be involved in both the production and mediation of many glomerular diseases. A schematic depiction of the relationship among immune events, effector cells, mediator release, and eventual glomerular injury is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52652\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52652 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The complexity of this scenario that leads to a &quot;perfect storm&quot; of unfavorable conditions is well illustrated by immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. This disease results from a defect of IgA glycosylation, which induces antibodies to the altered IgA that bind to receptors at the surface of macrophages and mesangial cells and finally deposit in the mesangium as immune complexes, activating the alternative pathway of complement. Environmental (eg, gluten-containing food, microbiota) and genetic factors also play a critical role in the development of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Genetics intervene at each step of the pathogenesis, including defective glycosylation, the immune response to altered IgA, response to infection through innate immunity, and complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

The humoral, T helper cell 2 (Th2)-regulated immune response leads to B cell activation, immunoglobulin deposition, and complement activation in glomeruli. The cellular, T helper cell 1(Th1)-regulated immune response contributes to both the infiltration of circulating mononuclear inflammatory cells (including lymphocytes and macrophages) into glomeruli and to crescent formation.

Examples include postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN), immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease, lupus nephritis, membranous nephropathy (MN), immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative GN, and most causes of rapidly progressive (crescentic) GN. </p><p>Immune deposits form in the glomerulus either actively because the target antigen(s) is localized predominantly in the glomerulus or passively because of the role of the glomerulus in filtration.

These non-glomerular endogenous antigens localize in glomeruli as a consequence of passive trapping often via spontaneous aggregation or by interaction with negatively charged sites on the glomerular capillary wall.

These include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biologic properties of the immunoglobulins that form the deposits. As an example, complement-fixing IgG subtypes, such as IgG1 and IgG3, cause more injury than immunoglobulins that activate complement poorly, such as IgA and IgG4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism by which the deposits are formed.

Pathogenic antibodies against linear epitopes on the Goodpasture antigen have been associated with kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and an epitope motif has been identified in a mutual B and T cell epitope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Certain myeloperoxidase (MPO) epitopes have been found to be specific for active antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) disease, while others remain present during remission or are also present in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. These findings explain the lack of correlation between MPO-ANCA titers and active disease. There is accumulating evidence that intra-molecular spreading is a key event in the development of pathogenicity and disease severity in anti-GBM disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], ANCA disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], and phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)-related MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>Independent of how or where immune deposits form in glomeruli, there is evidence that immunoglobulins alone may induce significant tissue injury. Antibodies directed against some components of the podocyte slit diaphragm (such as nephrin) can induce proteinuria without inflammation. One example has been described in patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF), which is associated with a defect in the gene for nephrin. When patients with CNF undergo renal transplantation, they often develop anti-nephrin antibodies with recurrent nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In experimental and human MN, nephritogenic antibodies most likely behave as bifunctional molecules activating complement and altering the function of the target antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/26,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37,38</a>].

These mediators include products of complement activation, such as C5a and C5b-9, that are induced by antibodies; oxidants and proteases released by both inflammatory and resident glomerular cells; and a variety of other cytokines, growth factors, and vasoactive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/1,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,39</a>]. </p><p>Glomerular injury can also result from the <strong>absence</strong> of certain mediators. As an example, complement factor H (CFH) is a negative regulator of the alternative pathway of complement. In mice, CFH deficiency leads to uncontrolled C3 activation and spontaneous renal disease similar to C3 glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In humans, a familial form of C3 glomerulopathy has been described in patients of Cypriot origin who have a mutation in the gene for complement factor H-related protein 5. This mutation increases the ability of complement factor H-related protein 5 to bind factor H, thereby preventing factor H from regulating C3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Because the corresponding gene products compete with factor H, it has been hypothesized that the absence of these genes could lead to more potent inhibition of complement by factor H [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Higher serum factor H-related protein (FHR)-5 levels were associated with a lack of response to immunosuppression, the presence of endocapillary hypercellularity, and histology scores of disease severity (the Oxford Classification MEST score) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

The etiologic agents in human GN are largely unknown with the exception of infection-related forms of disease, such as beta-hemolytic streptococci in poststreptococcal GN, and hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus in cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative GN. It is likely that most precipitating factors, such as infections, cancer, and drug and toxin exposures, initiate similar immune responses that result in GN via shared common pathways. The nature of the immune responses which lead to GN and the individuals who develop them are strongly influenced by immunogenetic phenotypes. (See <a href=\"#H670243\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nephritogenic immune response includes both humoral and cellular components (see <a href=\"#H670249\" class=\"local\">'Components of the nephritogenic immune response'</a> above). The humoral, T helper cell 2 (Th2)-regulated immune response leads to immunoglobulin deposition and complement activation in glomeruli. The cellular, T helper cell 1(Th1)-regulated immune response contributes to both the infiltration of circulating mononuclear inflammatory cells (including lymphocytes and macrophages) into glomeruli and to crescent formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-crescent-formation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation&quot;, section on 'T cells'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Humoral immunity &ndash; Most human glomerular diseases are characterized by glomerular immunoglobulin deposition along with complement components, which suggests that the humoral immune response is the principal cause of injury. Examples include postinfectious GN, immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, anti-GBM antibody disease, lupus nephritis, membranous nephropathy (MN), immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative GN, and most causes of rapidly progressive (crescentic) GN. Immune deposits form in the glomerulus either actively because the target antigen(s) is localized predominantly in the glomerulus or passively because of the role of the glomerulus in filtration. (See <a href=\"#H670255\" class=\"local\">'Humoral immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cellular immunity &ndash; Strong evidence exists for a primary role for mononuclear cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages in the absence of antibody deposition, in causing glomerular injury in diseases such as minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and some forms of crescentic glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H670261\" class=\"local\">'Cellular immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two immune mechanisms of glomerular injury are inflammatory and noninflammatory (see <a href=\"#H670267\" class=\"local\">'Immune mechanisms of glomerular injury'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inflammatory injury (ie, GN) is characterized by glomerular hypercellularity that results from infiltrating hematopoietic cells (such as neutrophils and macrophages) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proliferating glomerular cells. These effector cells induce other abnormalities, such as thrombosis, necrosis, and crescent formation which, if extensive, can result in rapidly progressive GN. The major clinical features of glomerulonephritis are hematuria and occasional leukocyturia, often with some of the red blood cells having a dysmorphic appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62064 \">picture 2</a>), with or without red blood cell casts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55778\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55778 \">picture 3</a>); varying degrees of proteinuria, ranging from mild to the nephrotic range; and, depending upon disease severity, a normal or reduced glomerular filtration rate. The major mediators and effector cells of the cellular inflammatory response include (see <a href=\"#H670286\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory mechanisms of glomerular injury'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Complement and other humoral mediators such as macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), chemokines, and cytokines, which recruit effector cells. (See <a href=\"#H670292\" class=\"local\">'Complement and other humoral mediators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Neutrophils, which phagocytose immune complex aggregates, become activated, and undergo a respiratory burst that generates reactive oxygen species, cationic serine proteases, and extracellular traps implicated in glomerular necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H455857134\" class=\"local\">'Neutrophils'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Macrophages, which generate oxidants, proteases, tissue factor (which initiates fibrin deposition and crescent formation), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta, which leads to the synthesis of extracellular matrix and the eventual development of sclerosis). (See <a href=\"#H670304\" class=\"local\">'Macrophages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>T cells, which release chemokines and recruit macrophages that subsequently function as effector cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F89119\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89119 \">figure 2</a>). T helper 17 (Th17) cells may be particularly important in anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated GN present in many patients with microscopic polyangiitis and a minority of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. (See <a href=\"#H670310\" class=\"local\">'T cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Platelets, which are prominent in several glomerular lesions, primarily those that involve intraglomerular thrombosis. Platelets also release a number of products that participate in and augment glomerular injury including vasoactive, mitogenic, and chemotactic substances. (See <a href=\"#H670322\" class=\"local\">'Platelets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Noninflammatory lesions resulting from immune injury usually involve the glomerular podocyte (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50018 \">picture 4</a>) and are associated with a major functional change in the glomerulus that results in an increase in glomerular permeability to albumin and other proteins. The major clinical features of noninflammatory glomerular lesions are proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome, with little or no hematuria and no red blood cell casts. A number of immune mediators can directly induce sufficient podocyte dysfunction to result in nephrotic-range proteinuria without inflammation. These include (see <a href=\"#H670352\" class=\"local\">'Noninflammatory mechanisms of immune glomerular injury'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>T cell-derived factors, vasoactive agents, and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-13 and cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1. (See <a href=\"#H670358\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenic agents in podocytopathies of immune origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Glomerular permeability factors, such as the soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR, also called soluble urokinase receptor) and angiopoietin-like 4 protein (Angptl4), although the nature of these permeability factors remains elusive. (See <a href=\"#H159590795\" class=\"local\">'Possible role of suPAR'</a> above and <a href=\"#H159590801\" class=\"local\">'Possible role of angiopoietin-like 4 protein'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Complement C5b-9 (the membrane attack complex), particularly in MN. The role of complement regulatory proteins is increasingly recognized, particularly in C3 glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy. (See <a href=\"#H670370\" class=\"local\">'Complement membrane attack complex in membranous nephropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H670376\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of complement activation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major determinant of whether the patient has an inflammatory injury (GN) presenting with an active urine sediment or a noninflammatory injury presenting with proteinuria and little or no hematuria is the <strong>site</strong> of glomerular injury &ndash; particularly, which glomerular cells are involved. Glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells are <strong>not</strong> separated from circulating factors (eg, complement) or inflammatory cells (eg, neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells), and injury to these cells typically produces an inflammatory injury. By contrast, glomerular epithelial cells (visceral and parietal) are separated from the circulation by the GBM. Thus, glomerular injury primarily involving the podocytes is commonly associated with little or no activation of circulating inflammatory cells. (See <a href=\"#H670274\" class=\"local\">'Importance of the site of glomerular injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of other factors can contribute to glomerular injury, including the biologic properties of immunoglobulins that form the immune deposits, whether immune deposits are formed in situ or trapped as preformed circulating immune complexes, the amount of immune deposit formation, the nature of the epitope(s), and the diffusion of the immune response (epitope spreading).
