At the time of initial presentation, the cause may be unclear and the direction of the platelet count trend may not be known. The clinician is faced with distinguishing among many possible causes of thrombocytopenia and determining the risks of bleeding, thrombosis, and other potential complications.</p><p>Here we discuss our approach to the adult patient with unexpected thrombocytopenia, divided according to clinical presentation (eg, asymptomatic, associated with another condition, acutely ill hospitalized patient). This approach can be used by the primary care physician and the consulting hematologist. Thrombocytopenia in neonates and children, and thrombocytopenia during pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-thrombocytopenia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of thrombocytopenia in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND AREAS OF CONCERN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20171700\"><span class=\"h2\">What is a low platelet count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below the lower limit of normal (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL</span> [150 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L]</span> for adults). Degrees of thrombocytopenia can be further subdivided into mild (platelet count 100,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL),</span> moderate (50,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">99,000/microL),</span> and severe <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;50,000/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, these numbers must be interpreted in the context of the underlying disease, and higher or lower values may be appropriate for certain conditions (eg, in the setting of gestational thrombocytopenia, we consider a platelet count between 80,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL</span> to represent mild thrombocytopenia; in the setting of immune thrombocytopenia [ITP], we consider a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL</span> to represent severe thrombocytopenia). Severe thrombocytopenia confers a greater risk of bleeding and implies a greater likelihood for needing treatment, but the correlation between the platelet count and the risk of bleeding varies according to the underlying condition and may be unpredictable. (See <a href=\"#H20171706\" class=\"local\">'When to worry about bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>The normal adult platelet count range is 150,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">450,000/microL,</span> with mean values of 266,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">237,000/microL</span> in females and males, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Within that broad normal range, adult women have slightly higher platelet counts than men, younger people have higher platelet counts than older people, and non-Hispanic Blacks have higher platelet counts than Whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Despite the wide variation of platelet counts within the population, there is little variation of the platelet count in a given individual over time. As an example, a study of serial platelet counts in 3789 individuals found that the platelet count range for an individual was relatively narrow; differences in platelet count greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">98,000/microL</span> occurred in less than 0.1 percent of participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Interestingly, there was a modest seasonal variation, with platelet counts approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> higher in the <span class=\"nowrap\">fall/winter</span> versus the <span class=\"nowrap\">spring/summer</span>. This wide normal range, narrow individual range, and continuous distribution have implications for evaluating any individual patient's platelet count:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small proportion of the population (approximately 2.5 percent) will have a baseline platelet count lower than <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL,</span> because normal values are typically determined based on the 95% confidence intervals around the mean.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An individual can have a significant decrease in platelet count and still be within the 'normal' range of platelet counts and thus not be flagged as abnormal (eg, a 50 percent reduction in platelet count is concerning, but the value may still be <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;150,000/microL)</span>. Such a reduction may be clinically significant and requires evaluation. At a minimum, the platelet count should be repeated.</p><p/><p>These issues highlight the importance of obtaining previous platelet counts (if available) to determine whether the count is stable or trending downward. A recent fall in the platelet count by 50 percent, even if still in the normal range, may herald severe clinical problems, and requires active follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20171706\"><span class=\"h2\">When to worry about bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding is a concern in patients with severe thrombocytopenia; however, the correlation between platelet count and bleeding risk is uncertain. Clinical predictors of bleeding include prior bleeding at a similar platelet count and the presence of wet purpura (eg, in mucosal membranes). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p>The concept of a &quot;safe&quot; platelet count is imprecise, lacks evidence-based recommendations, and depends on the disorder and on the patient (even with the same disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The following may be used as guides, but should not substitute for clinical judgment based on individual patient and disease factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical bleeding generally may be a concern with platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;100,000/microL</span> for some high-risk procedures such as neurosurgery or major cardiac or orthopedic surgery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe spontaneous bleeding is most likely with platelet counts &lt;20,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL,</span> especially below <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding risk in ITP may be slightly less than that in other conditions for the same platelet count (ie, we are less concerned about bleeding in an individual with ITP and a platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> than we are about bleeding in an individual with aplastic anemia and a platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL)</span>.</p><p/><p>It is also important to consider other factors that may affect bleeding risk (eg, platelet function defects, coagulation abnormalities). When present, these factors may contribute to bleeding risk and may be more concerning than the low platelet count.</p><p>The role of platelet function in bleeding risk is illustrated by the rare inherited disorder Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet function in which bleeding is out of proportion to the degree of thrombocytopenia. Similarly, patients with severe liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation may have a greater risk of bleeding from coagulation defects than from the thrombocytopenia.</p><p>In contrast, individuals with hemostatically normal platelets (eg, as seen in ITP) generally do not have severe spontaneous bleeding even with very low platelet counts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H224443\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Correlation of bleeding and thrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1490130\"><span class=\"h2\">When to worry about thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, patients with thrombocytopenia are at risk for thrombosis rather than bleeding. While most of the implicated disorders are rare, it is important to consider them because urgent treatment may be needed to prevent life-threatening thrombotic events.</p><p>Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</strong> &ndash; A small percentage of patients exposed to heparin (&lt;5 percent) will develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in which antibodies to a platelet factor 4 epitope induced by heparin can cause thrombocytopenia and platelet activation, leading to life-threatening venous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial thrombosis. This diagnosis should be considered in a patient recently exposed to heparin who develops thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, anaphylaxis, or skin reactions. Treatment involves immediate discontinuation of heparin and administration of a non-heparin anticoagulant. A discussion of non-heparin anticoagulants and evidence to support their use is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antiphospholipid syndrome</strong> &ndash; The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) can develop in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus, other medical conditions (eg, infection, medications, cancer), or in otherwise healthy individuals. Patients may have venous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial thrombosis. Treatment involves anticoagulation or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and treatment of any underlying condition, as discussed in detail separately.

DIC is commonly seen in acutely ill patients with sepsis or malignancy, but it can also be seen in a variety of other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58104 \">table 1</a>). Treatment of the underlying condition is paramount.

These microthrombi can occur in any organ and can be life-threatening. Plasma exchange for TTP may be life-saving and should be initiated immediately when TTP is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</strong> &ndash; Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare condition caused by loss of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol from cell membranes. Thrombosis of intraabdominal veins (eg, hepatic, splenic, portal) and cerebral veins can occur, along with hemolytic anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other cytopenias. Treatment depends on the degree of anemia, the presence of thrombosis, and the severity of organ involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20171346\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major pathophysiologic mechanisms of thrombocytopenia include decreased platelet production in the bone marrow; peripheral platelet destruction by antibodies; consumption in thrombi; dilution from fluid resuscitation or massive transfusion; and sequestration (pooling) of platelets in the spleen in individuals with portal hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenomegaly. These mechanisms are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone marrow disorders</strong> &ndash; Platelets are produced in the bone marrow from megakaryocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55409\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55409 \">picture 1</a>), which are derived from multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. Each megakaryocyte produces an estimated 1000 to 5000 platelets. The rate of platelet production is 35,000 to 50,000 platelets per microL of blood daily at steady state; production can be increased up to eightfold during times of increased demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Megakaryocyte biology and the production of platelets&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Typically, bone marrow disorders that impair platelet production (eg, nutrient deficiencies, myelodysplastic syndromes, <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/sepsis)</span> also reduce production of other blood cells (ie, red blood cells [RBC] and white blood cells [WBC]), causing pancytopenia. Patients may present with symptoms of thrombocytopenia (eg, bleeding, petechiae) or symptoms attributable to anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leukopenia (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">fatigue/shortness</span> of breath, infection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isolated megakaryocyte loss can also occasionally occur (eg, in response to a drug). In addition, primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is commonly associated with impaired platelet production due to the anti-platelet autoantibodies that also react with megakaryocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Platelet <span class=\"nowrap\">destruction/consumption</strong></span> &ndash; Platelets survive in the circulation for 8 to 10 days, after which they are removed by monocytes or macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (eg, liver and spleen), perhaps as a result of programmed apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. There may also be a contribution by Ashwell Morell receptors in the liver that recognize alterations in the glycan pattern on the surface of platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Accelerated destruction of platelets (and possibly megakaryocytes) can occur due to antibody-mediated clearance. Anti-platelet antibodies occur in primary ITP and also in secondary ITP (ie, in the context of another autoimmune syndrome such as systemic lupus erythematosus). They can also be induced by some medications and ingested substances (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of DITP'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Combined cytopenias due to antibody-mediated destruction of more than one blood cell line can also occur; the term Evans syndrome is used to refer to combined warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and ITP. Autoimmune neutropenia can also occur in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Evans syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Platelet consumption also occurs within thrombi in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombotic microangiopathies such as thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of acquired TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dilution</strong> &ndash; An additional mechanism of thrombocytopenia is dilutional thrombocytopenia, as occurs in the setting of massive fluid resuscitation or massive transfusion. Platelet counts are reduced in proportion to the number of RBC units transfused in a 24-hour period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Ratios of platelets to other products are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Trauma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of blood products in the critically ill&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Redistribution/splenomegaly</strong></span> &ndash; In individuals with normal splenic function, approximately one-third of the platelet mass is found in the spleen, in equilibrium with the circulating platelet pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Conditions that increase splenic size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause splenic congestion through portal hypertension (eg, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease) can decrease the platelet count without altering the total platelet mass in the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52400\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52400 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Severe thrombocytopenia or bleeding in the setting of splenomegaly should prompt the clinician to investigate for other causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Causes of splenomegaly'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20171374\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF THROMBOCYTOPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential causes of thrombocytopenia differ depending on the clinical setting in which it occurs. Individuals presenting with asymptomatic, isolated thrombocytopenia are more likely to have immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); whereas acutely ill, hospitalized patients who develop thrombocytopenia are more likely to have platelet consumption, dilution, bone marrow suppression from <span class=\"nowrap\">sepsis/infection,</span> or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In between these extremes are autoimmune disorders, nutrient deficiencies, thrombotic microangiopathies, or infections, which may have a range of presentations depending on the severity of the underlying condition.</p><p>Causes of thrombocytopenia are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77063 \">table 2</a>) and in the following list, ordered from the least likely to be symptomatic to the most acutely ill. However, the patient's clinical status cannot be used to exclude or confirm a diagnosis, as many of these causes can have a variable clinical presentation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Most pregnant women have normal platelet counts. Approximately 5 to 10 percent develop incidental thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, also termed gestational thrombocytopenia. Gestational thrombocytopenia is mild, asymptomatic, occurs during late gestation, and resolves spontaneously after delivery. There is no associated risk of bleeding or fetal thrombocytopenia. Any change from routine obstetrical care is discouraged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy#H2143458424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, if the platelet count is less than 70,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">80,000/microL,</span> evaluation for alternative explanations of thrombocytopenia such as ITP should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia accompanied by other findings during pregnancy (eg, renal insufficiency, hypertension, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) should prompt an evaluation for more serious disorders such as the <strong>h</strong>emolysis, <strong>e</strong>levated <strong>l</strong>iver enzymes, <strong>l</strong>ow <strong>p</strong>latelet count (HELLP) syndrome, preeclampsia, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Preeclampsia with severe features/HELLP'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy#H2945717795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'List of causes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic liver disease or hypersplenism</strong> &ndash; Isolated thrombocytopenia may be the initial manifestation of chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and congestive splenomegaly (hypersplenism). Thrombocytopenia is usually mild to moderate (eg, in the range of 60,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL),</span> and the spleen is often palpably enlarged. In these conditions, the total number of platelets is normal; the low platelet count in the peripheral blood merely represents redistribution of a greater proportion of platelets into the congested spleen. Up to 90 percent of platelets may be pooled within the splenic circulation in patients with chronic liver disease and hypersplenism, compared with approximately one-third of platelets in individuals without hypersplenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Consistent with these findings, the frequency of thrombocytopenia in a series of 354 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Other cell lines are unaffected (ie, ITP does not cause anemia or leukopenia). The prevailing understanding of the mechanism of ITP is antibody-mediated platelet destruction. However, anti-platelet antibodies are not always detected, and their testing is not clinically useful. A presumptive diagnosis of ITP is made when the history, physical examination, and laboratory data do not suggest an alternative diagnosis. Only a complete blood count (CBC) and review of the peripheral blood smear are required; however, other testing may be useful to eliminate secondary causes of ITP (eg, HIV and hepatitis C testing) or other non-immune causes of thrombocytopenia (eg, liver enzymes for possible hepatic impairment). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Congenital platelet</strong> <strong>disorders</strong> &ndash; Some congenital platelet disorders associated with thrombocytopenia are discovered incidentally. Several may be associated with very large platelets on the peripheral blood smear (eg, MYH-9 related disorders, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Gray platelet syndrome).
