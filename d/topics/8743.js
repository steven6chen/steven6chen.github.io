In that setting, surgical excision is curative in most cases, and patients at high risk of developing metastatic disease may benefit from adjuvant immunotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of patients with disseminated disease is a difficult problem, although recent advances have led to important improvements in patient outcomes. These approaches include immunotherapy (particularly with checkpoint inhibition) and targeted therapy that inhibits the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecularly targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the efficacy and role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of advanced melanoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F105384\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105384 \">algorithm 1</a>). The toxicity associated with these agents is discussed separately, as is an overview of the management of patients with advanced melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175770042\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of cellular immunity begins when T cells recognize peptide fragments of intracellular proteins that are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) bound to specific mixed histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This interaction requires the presence of a costimulatory molecule (B7), and this activation results in upregulation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). The CTLA-4 receptor on T lymphocytes is a negative regulator of T cell activation that outcompetes cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) for binding to B7 on APCs. CTLA-4 thereby serves as a physiologic &quot;brake&quot; on the activated immune system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A second co-inhibitory pathway uses the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), which is an inhibitory receptor present on activated T cells. When PD-1 binds to its ligand (PD-L1), which is often present on activated tumor cells, the ability of the T cell to produce an effective immune response is down-modulated. Antibodies directed against PD-1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a>) or PD-L1 thus may restore or augment an antitumor immune response and produce tumor regressions in patients with advanced melanoma. (See <a href=\"#H535873858\" class=\"local\">'Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p>Tissue studies have demonstrated that individual melanomas are frequently associated with a large number of somatic mutations, in large part due to ultraviolet damage from sun exposure, and these collections of somatic mutations appear to be unique in each melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-of-advanced-melanoma-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These mutations may result in the presentation of cancer-specific antigens (mutation-associated neoantigens [MANA]) that serve as the targets for checkpoint inhibitor-reactivated immune cells. Ultimately, the number of such somatic mutations, among other factors, may be able to predict which patients will have a response to immunotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262059967\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPONSE TO CHECKPOINT INHIBITION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601233049\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy requires an understanding of the potentially different patterns of response seen with these classes of agents. The patterns of response to treatment with these immunotherapy agents can differ from those with molecularly targeted agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy in several important respects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have a transient worsening of disease, manifested either by progression of known lesions or the appearance of new lesions, before the disease stabilizes or tumor regresses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103343\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103343 \">image 1</a>). Therefore, some caution should be taken in abandoning therapy early. However, these delayed responses are generally not observed in patients with symptomatic deterioration, so continuing therapy beyond progression is not recommended in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responses can take longer to become apparent compared with cytotoxic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients who do not meet criteria for objective response can have prolonged periods of stable disease that are clinically significant.</p><p/><p>Immune-related response criteria have been proposed to properly recognize the nontraditional patterns of response occasionally seen with checkpoint inhibitors and some other immunotherapies. These are discussed in detail separately.
