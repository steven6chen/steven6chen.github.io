Patients who are unable to tolerate medication, noncompliant with medication, or who are medication dependent and unwilling to take lifelong medications are also surgical candidates.</p><p>The surgical management of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is reviewed in this topic.

Some patients continue to have substantial symptoms of &quot;reflux&quot; despite elimination of the heartburn component of their GERD and may wish to consider operation on this basis alone. However, continued symptoms despite adequate acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should serve as a warning that symptoms may not be due to excess esophageal acid exposure but to functional heartburn, a malignancy, or extra-esophageal disease.

Relief of respiratory symptoms is usually achievable by fundoplication in patients who also have typical reflux symptoms; however, the outcome is less favorable in the substantial minority of patients in whom respiratory symptoms occur in association with abnormalities of esophageal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Although cough may present as one of the most common extraesophageal symptoms of GERD, asthma, chronic bronchitis, laryngitis, idiopathic subglottic stenosis, and even laryngeal cancer have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Many of these patients do not have typical features of GERD, such as heartburn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngeal disease</strong> &ndash; There is no role for considering surgery as a first-line treatment for posterior laryngitis. However, it is reasonable to consider surgery for patients who have abnormal pharyngeal acid on a double probe pH study when medical therapy has been maximized, is not tolerated, or is impractical.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite the large volume of literature, skepticism exists about the direct causal relationship between pharyngeal acid exposure and laryngeal diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Paralleling this uncertainty is the debate whether entities such as posterior laryngitis should be treated empirically with anti-acid therapy or evaluated diagnostically to prove the existence of abnormal pharyngeal acid prior to initiating anti-acid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. One of the most recent controlled trials demonstrated efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> in the treatment of posterior laryngitis, supporting empiric therapy as first line treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Numerous studies also support the effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> and other anti-acid strategies in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On the other hand, some data suggest that symptoms recur after treatment is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], while other data have shown that laryngeal symptoms can be treated successfully by laparoscopic fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Documented response rates for airway diseases are less than that of fundoplication performed purely for typical gastroesophageal symptoms. Approximately 70 percent of patients will experience symptom improvement, while approximately 33 percent of patients may remain on medication but often at a far reduced dosage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asthma</strong> &ndash; Consensus has not been achieved on the role of surgery in patients with asthma that is thought to be related to GERD. A systematic review that included 24 reports (mostly case series and uncontrolled trials) suggested that surgery improved asthma symptoms, asthma medication use, and pulmonary function in 79, 88, and 27 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A dramatic reduction in steroid dependency postoperatively was documented in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Medical therapy is associated with an improvement in symptoms and reduction in asthma medication use in 60 to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux and asthma&quot;</a>.) Improvement in pulmonary function has not been documented after medical or surgical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>]. Some consideration should be given to lowering the threshold to surgery in asthmatics, especially younger patients, in whom significant GER can be demonstrated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus for the optimal preoperative investigation for appropriate surgical candidates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82167 \">table 1</a>). Upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and an assessment of esophageal length and degree of hiatal herniation are the most useful tests in making surgical decisions. Some patients may require gastric empty studies if preoperative symptoms of bloating are prominent suggesting that delayed emptying may contribute to the reflux.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper endoscopy</strong> &ndash; Esophageal and gastric endoscopy should be performed to assess the esophageal and gastric mucosa for signs of malignancy prior to proceeding with a surgical antireflux procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophageal manometry</strong> &ndash; Esophageal manometry studies are of value and should be used routinely in preoperative evaluation. Manometry occasionally provides alternative diagnoses, such as scleroderma or achalasia, for which antireflux surgery may be contraindicated. In addition, manometry may lead to a modification of the surgical approach or a change in management, although the need to modify the surgical procedure based upon the manometric findings has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The presence of a markedly shortened esophagus or a large hiatal hernia that does not reduce in the upright position may tip the scales in favor of a transthoracic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric emptying studies</strong> &ndash; Two- or four-hour gastric emptying studies should be considered when the careful history needed in the evaluation of a gastroesophageal reflux disease patient suggests gastric outlet obstruction or gastroparesis. A combination of antireflux procedure and significantly impaired gastric emptying will lead to bloating and discomfort. Some surgeons will choose to add a pyloroplasty to improve gastric emptying when serious dysfunction is revealed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF OPERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Current experience with antireflux surgery suggests that there is no one best operation for all patients. Factors such as the degree of esophageal shortening, disturbances of esophageal motility, prior operations, and local expertise with laparoscopic techniques influence the choice of operation. It remains unclear which patient characteristics influence postoperative success following fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A comprehensive review of the literature shows that there is no consistent association between surgical outcomes and preoperative response to acid suppression medications, baseline symptoms, baseline acid exposure, degree of lower esophageal sphincter competence, or position of reflux. </p><p>For the patient with normal esophageal length and motility, the operation of choice is probably a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Studies comparing partial fundoplication to the 360 degree Nissen fundoplication have consistently reported less postoperative dysphagia with partial fundoplication but greater long-term durability with complete fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Early uncomplicated disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One report, for example, proposed a &quot;tailored approach&quot; to antireflux surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Trans-abdominal Nissen (laparoscopic if possible) fundoplication was recommended for most patients with early, uncomplicated disease (which accounted for approximately 65 percent of 104 patients seen over a seven-year period). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopy versus laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of important questions exist about antireflux surgery, such as short-term and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic techniques in comparison with traditional approaches and whether earlier consideration of surgical therapy to prevent complications of GERD is warranted. </p><p>A laparoscopic operation performed by an experienced surgeon can offer significant advantages over the open operation with similar efficacy and safety and may be an attractive alternative to lifelong medical therapy. A meta-analysis of 12 prospective trials found a 65 percent reduction of complication rates for patients treated with laparoscopic antireflux surgery compared with open antireflux surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients undergoing a laparoscopic approach had a faster convalescent rate (three fewer days in hospital), a faster return to work (eight days sooner), and a similar treatment outcome. However, the patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery also had a 79 percent higher rate of reoperation (odds ratio 1.79, 95% CI 1.00-3.22). </p><p>In addition to low morbidity rates, the 30-day mortality rates are also low. In a retrospective review of 7531 patients undergoing a laparoscopic fundoplication, the overall mortality rate was 0.19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The mortality rate was significantly lower for patients &lt;age 70 in comparison with patients &ge;age 70 years (0.05 versus 0.8 percent).</p><p>In the follow-up study of a randomized trial comparing laparoscopic with open Nissen fundoplication in the Netherlands, 90 and 95 percent of patients reported symptom relief at 17 years, with no differences in GERD symptoms or dysphagia. Despite that, 43 and 49 percent of the patients used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) after laparoscopic and open surgery, although the indication for the PPI use was not specified. Surgical reinterventions were more frequent after open surgery (18 versus 45 percent), mainly due to incisional hernia corrections (3 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Robotic surgery, a newer minimally-invasive technique, offers no specific advantages over other laparoscopic techniques and is more costly to perform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Randomized trials have not been performed to assess short-term or long-term benefits of the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased motility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although surgery cannot directly influence esophageal motility in patients with GERD, Nissen fundoplication can lead to improvement in esophageal contraction amplitude. This benefit is limited to patients with preoperative amplitudes above the fifth percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal motility testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the patient with normal length but decreased motility, a complete fundoplication is discouraged; the laparoscopic or open Toupet or Hill or transthoracic Belsey procedure could be performed. Wrapping the distal esophagus circumferentially or partially with a portion of stomach increases the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. However, too high of an LES pressure may lead to obstructive symptoms; thus, an incomplete wrap is often recommended in patients with poor esophageal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], although the results of at least one controlled trial raised questions about this recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal motility testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Shortened esophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a shortened esophagus from chronic inflammation or altered anatomy present a unique challenge to the surgeon. A Collis (esophageal lengthening) gastroplasty combined with an intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic fundoplication should be performed in these settings; however, opinions vary regarding what constitutes adequate esophageal mobilization. Trans-thoracic approaches should be considered for the patient with concurrent pulmonary disease requiring evaluation or extensive prior abdominal surgery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing the intra-abdominal esophageal length can be accomplished by reduction of hiatal hernia, approximation of the diaphragmatic crura, or tethering of the distal esophagus below the diaphragm. The bulk of a fundoplication may also keep the gastroesophageal junction within the abdomen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A gastroplasty may sufficiently lengthen the esophagus so that a fundoplication can be placed below the diaphragm. However, a fundoplication need not be intra-abdominal to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Extensive cephalad mobilization of the esophagus should be avoided and an intra-thoracic fundoplication performed in these settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for adequate mobilization of the esophagus is one reason cited for transthoracic approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The length of the overall sphincter can be affected by altering the length of a fundoplication; however, too long a fundoplication may lead to obstructive symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An incorrectly performed fundoplication may prevent appropriate relaxation of the LES with swallowing. The LES and fundus normally undergo vagally-mediated relaxation with swallowing. It is therefore important that the fundus is the <strong>only</strong> part of the stomach used for reinforcing the LES; the wrap is placed around the esophagus, not the upper stomach, and the vagal nerves must not be injured during dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advocates of the importance of the gastroesophageal valve support restoration of the angle of His (between the esophagus and gastric fundus) in order to improve the competence of the valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Reduction of hiatal hernia may also contribute to the efficacy of antireflux surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Reoperation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reoperation for failed antireflux surgery requires individual evaluation and consideration of alternative options for further management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of antireflux procedures have been described for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51213%7EGAST%2F78957\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51213 graphicRef78957 \">figure 1A-B</a>). The most common procedures (Nissen fundoplication, Belsey Mark IV, and Hill repair) claim about an 85 percent success rate in relieving symptoms and healing esophagitis. Long-term mortality of surgical management is quite low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].</p><p>Many surgical approaches focus on restoring a physiologic equivalent to the normal LES. Manometric studies of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) have documented that reflux is correlated with a lower mean LES pressure, shorter mean intra-abdominal LES length, and shorter overall sphincter length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

This procedure originally involved passage of the gastric fundus behind the esophagus to encircle the distal 6 cm of the esophagus. However, many variations and modifications have been described, and a &quot;Nissen fundoplication&quot; may be performed differently by different surgeons. Variables include: approach (transthoracic or abdominal); portion of stomach wall used (anterior and posterior or anterior only); combination with other procedures (eg, vagotomy or gastroplasty); the looseness of the wrap; the completeness of the wrap; and the length of the wrap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Most surgeons choose to perform a loose (&quot;floppy&quot;) Nissen fundic wrap that is about 1 to 2 cm in length including a posterior crural repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nissen fundoplication can also be effectively performed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Although there have been few long-term studies, a number of observational studies of laparoscopic fundoplication demonstrate comparable safety, short-term efficacy, and patient satisfaction, as well as shorter hospital stays and recuperative times than with open operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-53</a>]. A prospective, randomized trial comparing open with laparoscopic fundoplication in 110 consecutive patients found, at up to 11 years follow-up, similar benefits on symptoms but a significantly higher incidence of incisional hernias and defective fundic wraps in the open group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>A 2005 systematic review concluded that laparoscopic fundoplication was as effective as open fundoplication for relieving heartburn and regurgitation, improving quality of life, and decreasing antisecretory medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Almost 90 percent of patients who were followed for five or more years reported improvement in symptoms. However, when considering studies of both open and laparoscopic fundoplication, 10 to 65 percent of patients still required some form of antisecretory medications after surgery. No patient or procedure characteristic was consistently associated with surgical results with the exception of worse satisfaction and outcomes in patients with a significant psychiatric history.</p><p>The most commonly reported complications for laparoscopic procedures were gastric or esophageal injury, splenic injury or splenectomy, pneumothorax, bleeding, pneumonia, fever, wound infections, bloating, and dysphagia. These major complications were uncommon.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that the laparoscopic approach has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative dysphagia (8 to 12 percent) compared with an open approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/53,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56-58</a>]. Why this might occur is not well understood. It may be attributable at least in part to difficulty determining the looseness of the wrap at laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. For this reason, many surgeons construct the wrap over a large esophageal Bougie (48 to 60 Fr) passed into the stomach by the anesthesiologist to ensure adequate &quot;floppiness.&quot;</p><p>The type of procedure performed also may be a determinant of postoperative dysphagia. One report found that dysphagia was more frequent with the laparoscopic Rosetti-Nissen procedure (11 percent) than with either the laparoscopic Nissen (2 percent) or Toupet (2 percent) procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Individual study trend scores support the concept that patients undergoing a partial fundoplication experience less dysphagia; however, those patients also experience greater esophageal acid exposure, esophagitis, and need for re-operation. In addition, none of the patients in any of the Nissen series underwent mobilization of the short gastric vessels, and, in general, were performed over relatively smaller caliber Bougies, both of which may contribute to dysphagia and an inability to belch. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31943978\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of an anterior with a posterior fundoplication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laparoscopic anterior fundoplication (LAF) (90 to 180&deg; wrap) was proposed as an alternative to the laparoscopic posterior fundoplication (LPF) (180 to 360&deg; wrap) to reduce postfundoplication symptoms but was reported to have higher rates of recurrence of reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/30,100-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,100-104</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis of seven randomized trials found that the short-term results for 338 patients treated by a LPF included significantly less esophageal acid exposure time (0.8 versus 3.3 percent), heartburn (8 versus 21 percent), and a lower reoperation rate (4 versus 8 percent) compared with 345 patients undergoing LAF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. There were no significant short-term differences for the rate of esophagitis, regurgitation, belching, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or satisfaction between the two approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. The long-term outcomes for patients undergoing a LPF included a significantly lower rate of persistent heartburn (14 versus 31 percent) and a significantly lower reoperation rate (5 versus 10 percent) but no differences in dysphagia scores, inability to belch, gas bloating, or patient satisfaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H585085142\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison with medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The comparison of operative management with medical management in controlled trials has identified mixed long-term results, with some studies finding comparable control of symptoms and others reporting better control by a fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/42-45,105-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45,105-108</a>]. Differences in results may be related to differences in study design as illustrated by the following trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimized, contemporary medical (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a>, 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and surgical (standardized laparoscopic reflux procedure [LARS]) management provide similar five-year remission rates for controlling GERD symptoms. In a randomized trial, patients who underwent LARS had a slightly lower estimated five-year remission rate compared with those treated medically (85 versus 92 percent); this difference was not statistically significant after controlling for the effects of study dropout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Dysphagia, bloating, and flatulence were more common in patients treated with LARS (11 versus 5 percent, 40 versus 28 percent, 57 versus 40 percent, respectively), but acid regurgitation was less common (2 versus 13 percent). Although patients who underwent LARS had lower residual 24-hour esophageal acid exposure than patients treated medically (0.7 versus 2.1 percent at six months, and 0.7 versus 1.9 at five years), pH parameters did not predict treatment success or failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">LARS has not been shown to halt the progression from intestinal metaplasia (Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus) to dysplasia; the presence of intestinal metaplasia is not an indication for LARS. At the beginning of this trial, endoscopic findings of intestinal metaplasia were present in 11.1 and 10.5 percent of patients in the LARS and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> groups, respectively; and the prevalences at five years remained stable in both groups (13.6 percent LARS; 9.3 percent esomeprazole) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter, randomized trial (total randomized = 357 patients with greater than 12 months of GERD symptoms requiring maintenance therapy with a proton pump inhibitor) identified better control of GERD symptoms at five years following a fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>]. The trial, which included only 246 patients with five years of follow-up, found that patients undergoing a fundoplication (either a total or partial wrap per surgeon preference, n = 127) were less likely to require antireflux medication at five years compared with patients managed by medical therapy alone (44 versus 82 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. However, the study protocol permitted cross-over after randomization and only 63 percent originally randomized to a fundoplication had undergone the procedure, and 13 percent randomized to medical management had undergone a fundoplication. While the perfect trial has still yet to be performed, these studies lend credence to the concept that the optimal outcome achievable when fundoplication is performed by qualified surgeons is at least as good as medical therapy and possibly somewhat better at five years. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H831264445\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Other reasons for operative management include noncompliance, severe esophagitis by endoscopy, benign stricture, Barrett's columnar-lined epithelium (without severe dysplasia or carcinoma), dental erosion by acid exposure, and recurrent pulmonary symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative evaluation should include upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and an assessment of esophageal length and hiatal hernia (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above). Esophageal pH monitoring should be reserved for patients who have a negative upper endoscopy or atypical symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus on which is the best antireflux operative procedure for all patients. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Choice of operation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with GERD, a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is preferred by the author. The laparoscopic approach has an equivalent control of symptoms and a faster recovery compared with the open approach. However, the reoperation rate is higher following the laparoscopic approach. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopy versus laparotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laparoscopic approach offers several advantages with similar efficacy and safety as an open procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative symptoms of dysphagia occur in most patients (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative symptom management'</a> above). There is no consensus on the optimal dilatation procedure for postoperative stenosis. Most patients with symptoms of gas-bloat syndrome improve over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the laparoscopic posterior fundoplication (LPF) as the surgical approach for the treatment of GERD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Patients undergoing a LPF had fewer short-term adverse outcomes (eg, esophageal acid exposure time, heart burn, and reoperation rate) and fewer long-term adverse outcomes (eg, heartburn, reoperation rate) compared with patients undergoing a laparoscopic anterior repair.
