Our approach to treatment is generally consistent with guidelines from the European consensus statement, Asian-Pacific consensus statement, and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-case-studies/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Additional topic reviews that address the diagnosis and management of HBV include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-and-adefovir-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-hbv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lamivudine monotherapy for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760495202\"><span class=\"h1\">YOUNG MAN WITH ACTIVE REPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 25-year-old Asian man who is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (+) with serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA of 140 million international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. He has mild inflammation on biopsy. His serum alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) is 100.</p><p>This patient should be considered for therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>, tenofovir, or pegylated interferon alfa. The degree of elevation of the serum ALT is particularly important in influencing the decision to treat HBeAg-positive patients since it has proven to be one of the most important predictors of HBeAg seroconversion. In one study on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, for example, the rates of HBeAg seroconversion for patients with pretreatment ALT levels within normal, one to two times normal, two to five times normal, and more than five times normal were 2, 9, 21, and 47 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-case-studies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H3458586686\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Indications for antiviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>As a general rule, we consider the degree of elevation of the serum ALT in three categories: normal, between one to two times normal, and more than two times normal. Treatment with any of the approved therapies is unlikely to be successful in achieving HBeAg seroconversion in those with normal or minimally elevated serum ALT. The degree of liver inflammation on liver biopsy is also useful in predicting treatment related HBeAg seroconversion. Increasing data indicate that presence of HBeAg and high serum HBV DNA, lasting four decades or longer, are associated with increased risks of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related deaths. As a result, treatment may also be considered in patients who remain HBeAg-positive after the age of 40, regardless of ALT level.</p><p>For patients who are contemplating interferon treatment, a test for HBV genotype can be performed. Patients with HBV genotype A are more likely to achieve HBeAg as well as HBsAg seroconversion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of hepatitis B virus genotypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pros and cons of various treatment options should be discussed with the patient. The main advantages of nucleos(t)ide analogues are their favorable side effect profile and ease of administration. Among the nucleos(t)ide analogues, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> or tenofovir are preferred to minimize risk of drug resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-and-adefovir-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-hbv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given the young age of the patient, peginterferon should also be considered because of the finite duration of treatment, particularly if he has genotype A infection or if application of a 12-week futility stop rule is planned. The disadvantages of interferon are costs, side effects, and need for parenteral administration, but the duration of treatment is finite and interferon is not associated with drug-resistant mutations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3895751876\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESUMED PRECORE VARIANT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 20-year-old woman who is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (-). Her hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is 250,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. She has mild portal inflammation and no fibrosis. Her serum alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) is 60 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>.</p><p>I would follow this patient without recommending treatment at this time. Although this patient has the characteristics of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, it is uncommon for patients to be in this phase of chronic HBV infection at such a young age. Thus, she is likely to be infected with a precore variant. All approved treatments: interferon, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telbivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telbivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>, and tenofovir have a low rate of sustained response in such patients. Because she is young and has only mild histologic changes on liver biopsy, I think it is reasonable to observe her for the time being. I would repeat liver chemistries every three to six months, and I would start treatment if the ALT is persistently elevated and the HBV DNA remains high after one year of observation. </p><p>The situation would be different if the patient was 60 years old, had more than one elevated ALT, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> had moderate to severe inflammation, bridging fibrosis, or cirrhosis on liver biopsy. For such patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>, tenofovir, or peginterferon should be considered since this patient will need long-term treatment. In countries where quantitative HBsAg assays are available, testing for HBsAg level may be warranted, and if the level is high (eg,&gt;1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL),</span> treatment may be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331873145\"><span class=\"h1\">HBeAg-POSITIVE, HIGH HBV DNA, NORMAL ALT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 22-year-old man who is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (+), and anti-HBe (-). His hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is 14 million international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and serum alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) is persistently in the range of 20 to 30 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>. </p><p>I would not treat this patient at this time although his HBV DNA level is high. He is very young, and has a serum ALT that is normal (which predicts low probability of HBeAg seroconversion to both peginterferon and nucleos[t]ide analogs).</p><p>Although antiviral therapy can decrease serum HBV DNA level in this patient, there is no evidence that treating this patient at this stage will improve the clinical outcome. Given the low rate of HBeAg seroconversion, this patient will need to receive treatment for many years and even decades to derive a clinical benefit. As an example, in a study of 126 HBeAg-positive individuals receiving tenofovir alone, or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>, HBeAg seroconversion only occurred in three patients (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-case-studies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>For such patients, the feasibility of achieving a clinical benefit must be balanced against the need for long-term antiviral therapy and its associated costs and risks (eg, adverse events and drug resistance). It is also possible that this patient may undergo spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion during the next few years. Thus, I would follow this patient and recheck the ALT every three to six months. If his ALT becomes more than two times normal, I would monitor him more frequently and recommend treatment if he does not spontaneously seroconvert after three to six months. </p><p>The management of this patient would be different if he was older. I would biopsy this patient if he was 45 years old with similarly high HBV DNA levels. I would consider treatment if the HBV DNA level was persistently high or if there was <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advanced fibrosis on biopsy. The association of a high viral load with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma was examined in studies that enrolled patients in their 40s, and were most likely infected two decades longer than this patient who is in his 20s. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4213889714\"><span class=\"h1\">DENTAL STUDENT WITH ACTIVE REPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 24-year-old who has recently been admitted to dental school. He is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (+), and anti-HBe (-). His hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is 80 million international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and serum alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) is 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span>. The Dean of the dental school has denied his matriculation pending your advice.</p><p>Recommendations are periodically issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, the most recent of which were updated in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-case-studies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The CDC recommends that chronic HBV infection in itself not preclude the practice or study of medicine, surgery, dentistry, or allied health professions provided that the following criteria are met:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care providers and students who perform invasive exposure-prone procedures should have oversight from an expert panel. The expert panel should include one or more persons with expertise in the provider's specialty, infectious disease and hospital epidemiology, liver disease, the infected provider's occupational health, student health or primary care clinicians, ethicists, human resource professionals, hospital or school administrators, and legal counsel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HBV-infected providers can conduct exposure-prone procedures if a low or undetectable HBV viral load (spontaneous or while on treatment) is documented by regular testing at least every six months. A threshold of 1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> (5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">GE/mL)</span> or its equivalent is appropriate. The assay used should have a detection capability as low as 10 to 20 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. Spontaneous fluctuations above this level may occur and should prompt the HBV-infected provider to abstain from performing exposure-prone procedures while awaiting subsequent re-testing, changing drug therapy, or other reasonable steps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard precautions should be rigorously adhered to in all settings. </p><p/><p>Based on the above, I would advise this patient to reconsider his plans to enter dental school. Because he has high HBV DNA and low ALT levels, the likelihood of him responding (HBeAg loss) to current treatment is low and the chance of him clearing HBsAg is even more remote. He will likely need long-term if not life-long treatment and be subjected to frequent monitoring throughout his career (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>). The impact of chronic HBV infection with high level viremia on career paths of dental students is different from medical students who can choose career paths that do not involve performance of invasive procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70162411\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC CARRIER, ADVANCED HISTOLOGIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 50-year-old Asian man who is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (-). His serum alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) is 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span>. He has moderate hepatitis with bridging fibrosis on liver biopsy.</p><p>Although this patient has only a mildly elevated serum ALT, I would recommend treatment if his serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level is more than &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> based upon the advanced histologic features on his liver biopsy. The threshold HBV DNA level for initiating treatment in HBeAg-negative patients is lower than HBeAg-positive patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H761104648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p>This patient highlights the importance of liver biopsy in patients with normal or mildly elevated ALT, particularly older patients and those who have been infected for many years. An alternative approach is to perform a noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis, such as a Fibroscan. This type of noninvasive test is most reliable in the setting of a normal or minimally elevated ALT. Assuming he has no comorbid conditions or evidence of hepatic decompensation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>, tenofovir, or peginterferon would be reasonable options. Interferon should <strong>not</strong> be used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, but it may be used cautiously in patients who have bridging fibrosis and no evidence of clinical decompensation, normal hepatic synthetic function, and minimal or no evidence of portal hypertension. Because of the need for long-term treatment, entecavir or tenofovir is preferred if oral treatment is desired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461082809\"><span class=\"h1\">DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 75-year-old woman who is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (+), and has a serum alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span>. Her hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is 1600 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. She has ascites and known esophageal varices. She is not considered to be a candidate for liver transplantation.</p><p>Treatment with interferon is not an option for this patient because she has decompensated cirrhosis. I would treat this patient because there is little to lose and suppression of HBV DNA and any accompanying inflammation may be of benefit in a patient with very little hepatic reserve.</p><p>Given the need for long-term treatment, the risk of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telbivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telbivudine</a> resistance and the possibility of clinical deterioration due to breakthrough infection must be considered in a patient who is not a transplant candidate. I would also not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a> because of its inconsistent antiviral effects.</p><p>An important question is whether these patients should receive de novo combination oral antiviral therapy. A trial comparing de novo <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> monotherapy with a combination of entecavir and tenofovir found no difference in virologic and serologic responses overall, but combination therapy resulted in more rapid viral suppression and a higher percent with HBV DNA &lt;50 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> at week 96 among the subset of patients with baseline HBV DNA &gt;10<sup>8</sup> international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-case-studies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. None of the patients had evidence of genotypic resistance up to week 96. These data indicate that de novo combination therapy is not necessary in most patients but may have a potential benefit in patients with high baseline HBV DNA, leading to more rapid viral suppression though the impact on clinical outcomes is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combination-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With these considerations in mind, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> or tenofovir is preferred. Entecavir may be a better choice because patients with decompensated cirrhosis are at risk of renal failure and because this patient is 75. Available data showed that entecavir and tenofovir are well tolerated in this patient population, although one case series reported the occurrence of lactic acidosis in patients with severe liver dysfunction receiving entecavir. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations would be the same if this patient is a 44-year-old and is currently on the liver transplant waiting list. Suppressing HBV DNA to undetectable at the time of transplantation will reduce the risk of HBV recurrence post-transplant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2837648843\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT REMAINS HBeAg-POSITIVE DESPITE LAMIVUDINE FOR ONE YEAR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 40-year-old man with pretreatment alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) 129 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> and moderate inflammation on liver biopsy. He remains hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, but HBV DNA is undetectable by polymerase chain reaction after one year of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>.</p><p>It is important to think through the treatment plan and all its contingencies prior to beginning any type of therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is reasonable to continue treatment since a longer duration of treatment is associated with an increased probability of HBeAg seroconversion. Although this patient has undetectable HBV DNA, he will likely require many more years of treatment with a high risk of drug resistance (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-monotherapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lamivudine monotherapy for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>), therefore, I would switch him to tenofovir. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> may be used in patients who had been exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> for a short time and in whom serum HBV DNA is undetectable, tenofovir is a better option in patients who are lamivudine experienced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-and-adefovir-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-hbv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210464145\"><span class=\"h1\">BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION WHILE ON LAMIVUDINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 56-year-old woman who is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (+) and has early cirrhosis on liver biopsy. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> was associated with an initial decline in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titers to undetectable levels by polymerase chain reaction assay and normalization of serum aminotransferases. However, after 18 months of treatment, she developed a flare in serum aminotransferases with increasing levels of HBV DNA. She remains HBeAg-positive.</p><p>It is likely that this patient has developed breakthrough infection with a lamivudine-resistant mutation. If possible, specific testing to confirm resistance should be performed, as breakthrough infection may also be due to medication non-compliance. It is important to differentiate hepatitis flares associated with HBeAg seroconversion (which is accompanied by decrease in HBV DNA level) versus flares associated with emergence of drug resistance (which is accompanied by increase in HBV DNA level).</p><p>In this case, the patient was compliant with medication and had increasing HBV DNA level. Given that she has advanced histologic features, it would be reasonable to switch to tenofovir 300 mg daily. Tenofovir is preferred to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> because mutations to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> decrease susceptibility to entecavir and increase the risk of entecavir resistance. Studies have shown that tenofovir monotherapy is equally effective compared with the combination of tenofovir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> in suppressing lamivudine-resistant HBV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H2368395154\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Persistent viremia/breakthrough infection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2918586133\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is a 68-year-old man who is hospitalized with low grade fever, abdominal pain, anorexia, and jaundice. Serologic evaluation reveals that he is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive, IgM anti-HBc positive, with serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level of 300,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. Serum alanine transaminase&nbsp;(ALT) is 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L,</span> total bilirubin is 8.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and international normalized ratio&nbsp;(INR) is 1.5. Other causes of liver disease are excluded. The patient is not known to be a carrier for HBV; however, he is bisexual and thus has potential risk factor for HBV infection. His aminotransferases, INR, and total bilirubin rise slightly during the first two days of hospitalization while awaiting the results of the above serology.</p><p>It would appear that this patient has acute HBV, although spontaneous exacerbation of chronic HBV infection is also possible. It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish acute HBV from exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B based upon serology alone (unless there are previous laboratory tests available). The diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is based upon the detection of HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60627 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69344 \">figure 1</a>). However, IgM anti-HBc can also be seen during severe exacerbation of chronic HBV. This patient is more likely to have exacerbation of pre-existing chronic HBV if he has cirrhosis at diagnosis, a family history of HBV, or past history of liver disease. By contrast, acute infection is more likely in patients with a known recent exposure and no prior history of liver disease.</p><p>A question is whether the patient should be treated with antiviral therapy. The prognosis with acute infection is relatively worse in patients who are immunocompromised, have concomitant infection with hepatitis C virus, have pre-existing liver disease, or are elderly. Thus, the patient's advanced age is a risk factor for morbidity (and possibly mortality) from acute infection.</p><p>Few studies have addressed the benefits of antiviral therapy during acute infection. There are relatively more data with reactivation of infection in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. In this setting, prophylaxis with antiviral treatment can help prevent severe reactivation of hepatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Acute hepatitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do not believe that all patients with acute HBV require antiviral treatment since the likelihood of fulminant HBV is less than 1 percent, and in immunocompetent adults the likelihood of progression to chronic HBV infection is less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-case-studies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a general rule, we treat patients with a severe (such as those who develop a coagulopathy [INR &gt;1.5]) or a protracted course (such as persistent symptoms or marked jaundice [bilirubin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL])</span> for more than four weeks after presentation. We also recommend treating patients with fulminant HBV to reduce the likelihood of reinfection post-liver transplant. These recommendations are consistent with a 2009 guideline issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-case-studies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Treatment would be reasonable given this patient's advanced age and coagulopathy. Interferon should be avoided because of the risk of infection and further increase in hepatic necroinflammation. In patients suspected to have protracted or severe acute hepatitis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telbivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telbivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a>, tenofovir, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> would all be acceptable options given as monotherapy as the duration of treatment should be short. Entecavir or tenofovir are preferred, particularly if there is any doubt that this patient may have a severe exacerbation of chronic HBV and not severe acute HBV. Treatment can be stopped after confirmation (two consecutive tests four weeks apart) that the patient has cleared HBsAg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1545869645\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
