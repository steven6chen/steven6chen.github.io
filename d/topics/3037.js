The last step requires an understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of the different types of Cushing's syndrome; these will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Cushing's syndrome are discussed separately.

When such patients present with clinical features consistent with Cushing's syndrome, they may also be referred to as having physiologic hypercortisolism or pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. Clinically, patients with these physiologic forms of hypercortisolism seldom have the cutaneous (ie, easy bruising, thinning, and friability) or muscle (ie, proximal muscle atrophy and weakness) signs of Cushing's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, cortisol hypersecretion, when present, is usually minimal. Furthermore, even severely depressed patients with substantial cortisol hypersecretion rarely develop clinical Cushing's syndrome. However, some depressed patients may be difficult to distinguish clinically or biochemically from those with Cushing's disease. Their abnormal cortisol secretion presumably results from hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and disappears after remission of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Approximately seventy patients with chronic alcoholism and clinical or biochemical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Most had liver dysfunction, although the hormonal changes did not correlate closely with the degree of abnormality in liver function. In addition to liver dysfunction, these patients probably have transiently increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or vasopressin or impaired hypothalamic or pituitary responsiveness to cortisol. However, their peripheral and petrosal sinus plasma CRH concentrations are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Approximately 80 percent of endogenous Cushing's syndrome cases are ACTH dependent, and approximately 20 percent are ACTH independent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This distinction is possible because chronic hypercortisolism inhibits both hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin secretion as well as ACTH secretion by normal pituitary corticotrophs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among all patients presenting with Cushing's syndrome, the most common cause is iatrogenic Cushing's due to exogenous administration of glucocorticoids. The second most common form overall is Cushing's disease (pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH).

The most common cause of hypercortisolism is ingestion of prescribed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, usually for treatment of a nonendocrine disease. However, Cushing's syndrome also can be caused by other oral, injected, topical, and inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>] and by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> or high-dose medroxyprogesterone, progestins with some intrinsic glucocorticoid activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Cushing's syndrome may also be caused by the use of glucocorticoid-containing creams or herbal preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Factitious Cushing's syndrome is a rare disorder (responsible for less than 1 percent of patients with Cushing's syndrome) that refers to surreptitious intake of a glucocorticoid, often by patients who are close to the health professions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTH-DEPENDENT CUSHING'S SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark biochemical feature of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is a normal or elevated ACTH level, which reflects tumoral secretion. The tumor secretion of ACTH causes bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and hyperfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cushing's disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all patients with Cushing's disease have a pituitary adenoma, although the tumor is often not demonstrable by imaging; rare patients have diffuse corticotroph hyperplasia even in the absence of ectopic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion. The tumors are usually microadenomas; only approximately 5 to 10 percent are macroadenomas. Patients with macroadenomas are more likely to have supranormal plasma ACTH concentrations than are those with microadenomas (83 versus 45 percent), and the concentrations are less likely to fall with high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. A smaller proportion of those with macroadenomas respond to CRH stimulation (65 versus 84 percent); however, in all of those features, there is considerable overlap between patients with microadenomas and macroadenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the cause of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The amplitude and duration, but not the frequency, of ACTH secretory episodes are increased in Cushing's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>], and the normal ACTH circadian rhythm is usually lost (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54316\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54316 \">figure 1</a>). There is loss of tight synchrony between ACTH and cortisol secretory dynamics, perhaps reflecting the fact that ACTH secretion by the adenoma is not subject to hypothalamic regulation, because of suppressed CRH, and is relatively resistant to direct glucocorticoid inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The increased plasma ACTH concentrations, acting alone or in concert with other growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>], cause bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and hypersecretion of cortisol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F112079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112079 \">figure 2</a>). Consequently, the normal circadian rhythm in cortisol secretion is also lost (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60086 \">figure 3</a>). Awakening plasma ACTH and serum cortisol concentrations may be normal, but pre-bedtime concentrations are high. Salivary cortisol concentrations reflect those of serum free cortisol (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-cortisol-in-serum-and-saliva\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of cortisol in serum and saliva&quot;</a>). The loss of the nocturnal nadir in serum and salivary cortisol is used to document the presence of Cushing's syndrome.</p><p>The increased cortisol secretion is reflected by increased urinary excretion of cortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid (17-OHCS). ACTH secretion is increased more than that of cortisol, suggesting that the adrenal cortex is relatively unresponsive to excess ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. ACTH receptor (MC2R) levels are relatively decreased in the adrenocortical hyperplasia tissues of Cushing's disease patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The relative activity of the enzymes involved in cortisol biosynthesis does not change, and therefore, the production and excretion of cortisol precursors are increased proportionately.</p><p>The corticotroph adenoma cells respond to decreases in serum cortisol concentrations by increasing ACTH secretion and to increases in serum cortisol concentrations (or other glucocorticoids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) by decreasing ACTH secretion. However, quantitatively, the cells are relatively resistant to negative feedback inhibition by glucocorticoids. In effect, the tumor cells function at a higher than normal set point for cortisol feedback inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This characteristic is clinically important because it permits the use of dexamethasone suppression to distinguish between pituitary and ectopic ACTH secretion; the latter is usually more resistant to glucocorticoid negative feedback. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the cause of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-suppression-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dexamethasone suppression tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism for the resistance of corticotroph adenoma cells to glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition is unclear.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resistance to glucocorticoids may, in some cases, reflect abnormalities in the glucocorticoid receptor. In one report, a somatic frame-shift mutation of the glucocorticoid type 2 receptor was found in the tumor in one of four patients with Nelson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In another study, the tumors of 6 of 22 patients with Cushing's disease showed loss of heterozygosity for one of five polymorphisms at the glucocorticoid receptor type 1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Loss of heterozygosity was not detected in other types of pituitary adenomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal expression of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2 (11-beta-HSD-2), which converts cortisol to cortisone in ACTH-secreting adenoma cells, is a second possible mechanism for insensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study found deficient nuclear expression of one or two proteins, Brg1 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), in 17 of 36 human corticotroph adenomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F112079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112079 \">figure 2</a>). Decreased nuclear localization of these proteins, which are involved in repression of the proopiomelanocortin (<em>POMC</em>) gene, may account for resistance to glucocorticoid feedback in a subset of patients with Cushing's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p>The corticotroph adenomas that occur in approximately 2 percent of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome occur at the same age but tend to be larger and more resistant to glucocorticoid negative feedback than sporadic corticotroph adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>As the adrenal glands become increasingly hyperplastic, they secrete proportionately more cortisol in response to a given increment in plasma ACTH. This response serves to restrain ACTH secretion, even to the point of &quot;autosuppression.&quot; This phenomenon is especially pronounced in patients with severe bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>], in whom plasma ACTH concentrations may not exceed 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span>. Such patients may be thought erroneously to have ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome, but their ACTH levels can increase following administration of CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, no case of Cushing's disease has been documented to progress to fully ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ectopic ACTH syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Except in some patients with benign neuroendocrine (&quot;carcinoid&quot;) tumors, usually bronchial in origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>], ACTH secretion from malignant ectopic sources (such as from oat-cell carcinoma) is not inhibited by cortisol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, or other glucocorticoids. In rare patients, glucocorticoids increase tumor secretion of ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In general, tumors causing the ectopic ACTH syndrome tend to secrete a disproportionately greater proportion of POMC precursors, and these may be their major product. As in Cushing's disease, salivary cortisol concentrations reflect those of serum free cortisol and urinary excretion of cortisol and its precursors is increased proportionately.</p><p>Tumors of a wide variety of tissues, usually carcinomas rather than sarcomas or lymphomas, have been associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome; however, Ewing sarcoma has been reported in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

However, occasional adrenal adenomas produce relatively large amounts of androgen due to an increase in the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 (P450c17, 17-alpha-hydroxylase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Levels of CYP21A2 (P450c21, 21-hydroxylase), CYP17, and CYP11A1 (P450scc, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, cholesterol desmolase) mRNA are normal in cortisol-producing adenomas and 60 to 80 percent of normal in carcinomas, roughly proportional to their steroidogenic activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, adrenal carcinomas are frequently inefficient in terms of steroidogenesis. Since the efficiency per cell in converting cholesterol to cortisol is low but cell mass is very large, their production of cortisol precursors (eg, urinary 17-KS and serum and urinary DHEAS) is disproportionately higher. Even in patients with adrenal carcinomas who presumably do not produce excess steroids, more sensitive methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identify increased urinary metabolites of several steroids and precursors of androgens (pregnanediol, pregnanetriol, androsterone, etiocholanolone) or glucocorticoids (17-hydroxyproesterone, tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, 6-hydroxy cortisol, tetrahydrocortisol, and alpha-cortol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low serum aldosterone concentrations but normal or high serum or urinary concentrations of aldosterone precursors (ie, deoxycorticosterone, 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone, tetrahydro-11-deoxycorticosterone [THDOC and 5-alpha THDOC]) are found in most adrenal carcinomas but not in adrenal adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p/><p>Most adrenocortical tumors are monoclonal, suggesting that they result from accumulated genetic abnormalities, such as activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.
