Depressive symptoms can include depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-course-of-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The World Health Organization estimated that major depressive disorder was the 11th greatest cause of disability and mortality in the world among 291 diseases and causes of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-course-of-illness/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Preliminary studies suggest that course of illness may be associated with structural brain changes. As an example, a one-year prospective magnetic imaging study followed patients with treatment resistant unipolar major depression (n = 26) who were treated with pharmacotherapy, and found that remission was associated with subtle increases in hippocampal volume and cortical thickness, whereas nonremission was associated with decreased volume and thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-course-of-illness/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the course of illness in patients with major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).

In addition, patients seen in routine clinical practice often differ from patients who are followed after they complete randomized trials. Patients who participate in trials are usually recruited through advertisements, are willing to risk assignment to placebo, and meet extensive exclusion criteria that are typically used in industry-sponsored trials; thus, these patients may have less suicidality, psychosis, comorbidity, and functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-course-of-illness/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856410\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of illness for major depressive disorder (unipolar major depression) is heterogeneous, which may reflect that the disorder represents a number of different illnesses that differ in their pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-course-of-illness/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Patients may experience a single major depressive episode, follow a highly recurrent course with full resolution of symptoms between episodes, or spend much of their lives struggling with persistent, fluctuating symptoms.

Thus, for mild to moderate depression with recent onset and no suicidality or psychosis, reassurance and watchful waiting with short-term follow-up (eg, two weeks) may be a reasonable alternative to antidepressant treatment.
