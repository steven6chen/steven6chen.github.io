Accurate evaluation significantly affects the wellbeing of both patients and society, given the impact of disability status on financial remuneration, return to work, personal and workplace productivity, and access for existing and future health care needs.</p><p>Both treating and consulting clinicians are often asked to evaluate their patients for disability. Input from treating clinicians is crucial to disability evaluation because they often have the most in-depth and longitudinal knowledge of the patient's conditions and function, may be aware of medical and psychosocial contributions to ongoing disability, and can best advise on severity, permanency, and possible accommodations needed for an impairment.</p><p>When treating clinicians are unable to provide a disability evaluation, or when an insurance carrier has concerns that the treating clinician cannot be impartial, a consulting clinician may be hired to provide an opinion as an &quot;independent&quot; medical examiner. There is no doctor-patient relationship between the independent medical examiner and the patient.</p><p>Assessment of disability is complex, variable and challenging even among clinicians experienced in disability determination. A number of factors give rise to these challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The determination of disability requires a synthesis of clinical and nonclinical information.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definition of disability is not standardized across agencies that request a disability assessment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician is often required to define limitations in functional abilities and provide medical judgment for legal interpretation when medical evidence is insufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skills necessary to interact with multiple administrative and legal entities are not usually taught during medical training.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disability determination usually has financial implications for the individual and society that clinicians often consider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treating clinicians may feel uncomfortable making a determination which is not consistent with their patient's preference and could impact the doctor-patient relationship.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited time availability in the medical encounter can magnify these concerns.</p><p/><p>This topic will discuss definitions of impairment and disability, as well as review the clinician's role and important considerations when performing a disability assessment. Issues related to specific occupational disorders are discussed separately.

This documentation is interpreted and used by the judicial system, state and federal agencies, and private insurance companies, to determine the degree of disability and resulting compensation.</p><p>Specific objectives of the clinician in disability evaluations are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Define and document findings related to the individual's medical problems or impairments</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Define the severity of the medical problem (eg, temporary or permanent, partial or total impairment)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthesize medical information from different sources into a coherent picture of the individual's medical conditions and functional ability</p><p/><p>Most agencies recognize that treating clinicians can provide the best evidence for the existence of medical impairments and their consequences. While medical training may not specifically prepare clinicians to assess functional limitations, clinicians in practice have the unique opportunity to observe the effects of physical and mental impairments on their patients' overall function, including the ability to work and live independently. Social Security Administration (SSA) regulations note that treating medical professionals, with their longitudinal patient experience, can provide a perspective not obtainable from medical findings alone or from independent examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The first step in disability evaluation is the determination of medical impairment and its impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. An assessment of a patient's ability to perform work-related tasks for a particular occupation may or may not be required as part of the disability evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impairment is a disorder that causes alteration of body structure or function. Disability, commonly confused with impairment, refers to the limitation, due to impairment, in the ability to perform activities of daily living or complex activities such as work. Impairment is not defined relative to an environment. In contrast, disability accounts for the ability of an individual with an impairment to function in a specific environment. As an example, impairment due to a herniated disc with intermittent radiculopathy is present whether an individual is at home or at work. However, an individual with degenerative disc disease and sciatica is likely to be disabled for work as a manual laborer but may have minimal or no disability as a dispatch agent or while functioning at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitions of medical impairment vary, but common to all is the concept of a disorder that causes alteration of body structure or function, and specifically loss of functional use. Supportive clinical or laboratory findings are typically needed to document specific impairments and severity. Psychological diagnoses are usually included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Commonly-used definitions of impairment and disability are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63436 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The American Medical Association (AMA) &quot;Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,&quot; first published in 1958, promote a standardized approach to the assessment of medical impairment, especially for use in workers' compensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/4,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8</a>]. Many states' legal statutes, codes, or regulations in workers compensation, personal injury, or disability law have adopted various portions or editions of these guides to define diagnostic criteria required for medical impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50347 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most agencies consider an impairment permanent if there is no significant change in the condition for a 12-month interval. Changes in the condition and stability versus progression should be documented. Changes refer to fluctuations in the natural history of the condition (eg, variable glucose levels in a diabetic patient). Progression would be noted if the individual's diabetes progressed to involve renal dysfunction or if a disc herniation led to objective motor loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Social Security Administration (SSA) defines disability as &quot;the inability to engage in any substantial, gainful activity by reason of a medically-determinable physical or mental impairment(s), which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Models of disability distinguish impairment, function, and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These models acknowledge that disability is not inherent in the individual but results from the interaction between the impaired individual and the environment in which they function. The presence or absence of accommodations at work or home significantly determine whether the individual has a disability in a given setting.</p><p>Clinicians contribute to the determination of disability through their assessment of impairment and its impact on the individual's ability to perform activities of daily living and work. Disability assessment is commonly medically-centered, but not exclusively medically-based [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Definitions of disability from leading agencies vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63436 \">table 1</a>). In common, these definitions convey that disability incorporates the interaction of an impairment with its functional impact on a person's ability to participate in a life situation or activity.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies work disability as the result of the interaction of an individual's impairments and functional limitations in the context of multiple other factors, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to assistive technologies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attitudinal and other personal characteristics (eg, age, education, skills, and work history)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical and mental requirements of potential jobs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transportation accessibility</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attitudes of family members and coworkers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Willingness of an employer to make accommodations</p><p/><p>Many agencies, including the SSA, do not have the resources to implement the extensive evaluation required to assess disability as specified by the WHO. In lieu of this, screening criteria or equivalents are typically developed and some agencies and states use impairment as a proxy for disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States in 2013, 22 percent of noninstitutionalized adults reported any disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Disability in mobility was most frequently reported (13 percent), followed by disability in cognition (10.6 percent). Data from the 2009-2012 National Health Interview Survey found that 11.6 percent of United States adults 18 to 64 years of age reported a disability (defined as serious difficulty with hearing, vision, cognitive ability, or mobility [walking or climbing stairs]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>African Americans and Hispanics typically experience disability at a higher rate than do whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Compared with earlier surveys, rates of musculoskeletal conditions as a cause of disability increased, and heart disease as a disability cause decreased.</p><p>Among adults reporting a disability, the most commonly-identified limitations were difficulty walking three city blocks (10.3 percent) and climbing a flight of stairs (10.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. About 14 percent of noninstitutionalized people experience &quot;complex activity limitations&quot; and report an inability to participate fully in social roles, maintain a household, work, pursue hobbies, visit friends, and go to the movies or sporting events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Rates of occupational injuries, illness, and fatalities have been declining in the United States. In 2010 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a rate of 3.5 cases per 100 equivalent full-time workers of nonfatal occupational injuries and illness in the private sector, representing an ongoing decline by up to 0.2 cases per 100 workers per year since 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The rate of fatal work injury for United States workers in 2013 was 3.2 per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers, compared with a final rate of 3.4 per 100,000 in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The risk of work-related injury is highest in manufacturing, construction, natural resources and mining, education, and health services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Highest-risk industries for occupational fatalities continue to include construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, transportation, and warehousing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Despite declines in injuries, concerns have been raised that many workplace practices have not sufficiently improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Statistical declines may be attributable to changes in the manufacturing sector, outsourcing of many hazardous jobs, and increased attention given to workplace design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Economic impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The economic burden of disability to society is dramatic; the projected long-term program costs of the Social Security and Medicare programs are not sustainable under current program parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Cash flow deficits for Social Security expenditures exceeded noninterest income in 2010 and 2011, the first such occurrences since 1983, and will expand as the baby boom generation retires. The United States Social Security Administration (SSA) projects reserves to be exhausted in 2033. Medicare's financial status is even worse, with expenses exceeding revenues as of 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DISABILITY ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, systems that commonly require information from the clinician to determine disability include The Social Security Disability System, Workers' Compensation, Railroad Retirement, and Civil Service programs. Two of the most important sources of assistance for Americans with disabilities are Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), both administered by the United States Social Security Administration (SSA). SSI and SSDI act as a safety net for persons with disabilities, providing both cash assistance (monthly checks) and eligibility for health insurance (Medicaid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Medicare).</p><p>Federal, state, and private programs require medical input, typically at the initial evaluation stage and often at later stages of adjudication, for disability determination. Most often, clinicians are requested to document the medical impairment and provide a medical judgment regarding functional limitations from the impairment. This functional assessment may include the ability to perform specific work activities, as requested by the Social Security Administration, the state and Federal workers' compensation systems, and specific employee groups covered by the Long Shore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA). Other insurance carriers may arrange private disability assessments, normally performed by clinicians hired by the insurance company, who are designated as &quot;independent medical evaluators.&quot;</p><p>Clinicians and agencies often presume a strong correlation between the presence of a severe impairment and inability to work, with severe impairment used as a proxy for disability. This assumption is often satisfactory with severe impairments such as advanced cancer. For more moderate impairments, determining the patient's functional abilities and limitations will enable the agency disability evaluator to weigh those abilities in the context of the patient's education and work potential to determine if they are truly disabled from any work. The disability evaluator needs to consider whether a potential accommodation would be feasible, or whether the individual can realistically be retrained before determining if they are disabled from the usual requirements of most jobs. As an example, if the clinician provides information on the functional abilities of an individual who has had a myocardial infarction with atrial fibrillation, with an analysis of METS (metabolic equivalents), the evaluator can more objectively determine if they are totally disabled from specific manual labor or if they require restriction to sedentary or desk work.</p><p>For severely-impaired individuals, using impairment as a surrogate for work disability does provide a practical method of evaluation to determine who is disabled from work. The clinician is of significant assistance in providing answers to the more complex and common questions of the patient's current and predicted functional abilities on a routine basis under usual work conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The SSA and other agencies have the challenge of using this information along with the patient's age, education, and considerations of the increasingly complex and competitive economy to determine ability to return to customary work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">The Social Security Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician's role within the SSA system is to provide medical evidence about the nature and severity of an individual's impairment(s) and his or her functional abilities and limitations. The determination of disability is made by SSA.</p><p>The SSA asks the clinician to initially determine if the applicant has a severe impairment. An impairment is considered &quot;severe&quot; if it significantly interferes with an individual's ability to perform basic activities of daily living that are also needed in the workplace. These activities include walking, standing, sitting, lifting, pushing, pulling, reaching, carrying, handling, seeing, hearing, speaking, understanding, carrying out and remembering simple instructions, using judgment, responding appropriately (to supervision, coworkers and usual work situations), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dealing with changes in a routine work setting.</p><p>If the impairment is severe and meets the listings discussed below (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Listing of impairments'</a> below) and the patient is not working, he or she will likely be found to be disabled from work. If the listings are not met, the patient is not necessarily foreclosed from benefits, but further analysis of medical and vocational capabilities is then required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Listing of impairments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SSA has two &quot;Guides&quot; for disability evaluation for clinicians: a Blue Book for treating clinicians and a Green Book for consulting clinicians, both available electronically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The Blue Book explains the SSA disability process and provides a Listing of Impairments that clinicians can use to identify obviously disabled applicants who don't require the full evaluation process because their medical conditions meet criteria of sufficient severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The SSA listing of impairments can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm&amp;token=KpqDFfr6EUAB5cGumHLcPtlkjbiLOnGEJ70Mi645340dzFhIPf/QiQ4DwQkS0a1iZY4j8ZxKDJZKUQQw88bBZYJmFXKz5CBFqgguFLDYpSU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2791\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm</a>.</p><p>The Listings are divided into 14 broad categories by organ system or disease type (eg, malignant neoplasm), and then subdivided by specific conditions. Each listing specifies clinical criteria or measures of functional limitation (eg, treadmill tests, pulmonary function test, range of motion of joints, or IQ tests) and duration of involvement. The Listings are not measures of disability but measures of the severity of impairment; when the impairments are severe, they serve as a proxy for total work disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,3,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,26</a>].</p><p>If an applicant meets criteria for the medical diagnosis and findings on this list, and if the listed impairment has lasted or is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, the applicant will meet the medical criteria for disability. For example, an applicant with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent or less, who is unable to perform at a workload equivalent of 5 metabolic equivalents or less on an exercise test without exhibiting specified signs or symptoms (eg, electrocardiogram abnormalities or chest pain, Listing 4.02) is considered disabled according to the SSA. Some severe impairments are based on a diagnosis alone, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Listing 11.00) or inoperable malignancies (eg, Listing 13.09, metastatic melanoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/3,9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,26</a>].</p><p>It is important that the clinician document all the elements in the listing. Incomplete documentation will lead to a rejected claim and need for resubmission and appeal, resulting in costly delays for the applicant and system.</p><p>If the medical condition fails to meet requirements for severity based upon the criteria for a single condition, the applicant may still meet disability criteria if the functional limitations of the impairment(s) are equal in severity to the requirements of a listing. This is referred to as &quot;medical equivalence,&quot; and usually takes into account multiple impairments. The clinician will need to provide detailed information on functional limitations, the severity of the impairment, and provide an opinion regarding its equivalency to a particular listing. The SSA compares the applicant's medical impairments and functional limitations with those of a listing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Residual functional capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applicants who do not have a listed impairment or equivalent conditions may qualify for SSA if the clinician identifies them as having reduced residual functional capacity (RFC), preventing them from performing their past work or any other work available. The SSA takes into account the patient's age, education, and work experience in this determination. RFC is defined as the maximal activity an individual is able to perform despite functional limitations resulting from all impairments.</p><p>The following information will significantly assist the SSA in determining the RFC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many hours during an eight-hour work day can the individual sit, stand, or walk?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many pounds can the individual lift frequently (about two-thirds of a workday) and occasionally (about one-third of the workday)?</p><p/><p>According to the SSA, RFC assessment may be based solely on medical evidence if sufficient objective findings (eg, signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings) are provided to assess the applicant's capacity for work-related functions. These functions may include standing, lifting, carrying, and handling (which can be translated into functional capacity for sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy work); mental demands, such as making judgments and tolerating job-related stress; and sensory requirements, such as hearing and seeing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>To assess RFC, the clinician can use his or her clinical judgment based upon their knowledge of the patient, review the patient's daily activities, the severity of impairment based upon relevant measurement studies (eg, pulmonary function, cardiac output, hearing or vision studies), review reports from other providers such as a physical therapist, or order a functional capacity evaluation. Patients should not be cleared to do work activities that could worsen their condition, such as heavy lifting following a hernia repair. Discussion with specialists who performed a procedure to address current and future limitations is often helpful.</p><p>For example, an individual who completed physical therapy for a rotator cuff repair and lifts their grandchild and carries groceries or laundry will be able to perform some lifting. To identify their functional abilities and limitations, we find it helpful to ask the patient to describe a typical day and assess the scope of their activities of daily living. Asking patients how long they can drive and do errands, how long they watch TV, or what movies they have seen recently may give estimates regarding their ability to sit. Comparing their measured range of motion with a review of relevant studies and published reports on the required range of motion needed to perform activities daily also helps to estimate functional ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>The SSA uses medical and vocational &quot;grids&quot; which identify different levels of exertional capacity (sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy) required for applicants able to work based upon age, education, and prior work experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The assessment is typically based upon the medical evaluation and may include information obtained from tests such as a functional capacity evaluation and validated questionnaires. However, testing measurements do not exist that give highly reproducible, valid, sensitive, and low-cost assessments to reliably classify applicants as unable to work, especially when assistive technology and other accommodations are considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Many validated questionnaires were developed for research purposes, to enhance objectivity in the assessment of functional and pain-related impairment.

Such instruments score self-reported responses to functional questions (eg, how much difficulty an individual has lifting a carton of milk) followed by a new question based upon the initial response (eg, how much difficulty do they have lifting a suitcase). Artificial intelligence is used to select subsequent questions based upon prior answers until a set level of precision and high degree of accuracy is reached to relate responses to functional ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Physical or occupational therapy providers may be helpful in recommendations for an FCE. Clinicians who wish to assess functional ability without referral for physical testing may use the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), which is relatively quick and has demonstrated validity for measuring functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">WORKERS' COMPENSATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of workers' compensation programs is to provide prompt and appropriate medical treatment and, when appropriate, financial benefits to injured workers with the goal of restoring their function to their preinjury state while limiting employers' liabilities.</p><p>Under workers' compensation, employees are spared lengthy and uncertain litigation, while employers can expect more predictable costs than under the law of negligence. Additionally, employers have an incentive to improve workplace safety given their responsibility for medical and associated costs. Workers' compensation law varies among states. Common to all state systems are that employers pay all related medical costs, either directly or through insurance, injured workers receive income replacement and medical care for injury, and dependents, in case of worker death, receive income and burial benefits. The income benefit for total disability is set at a specified fraction of the worker's usual earnings for as long as he or she is unable to return to work, or for a set period of time as provided by the state's workers compensation law. In most states, benefits are payable only for defined periods of time.</p><p>Cases of occupationally-caused disease are treated differently than those involving traumatic injury, and are more often disputed as work-related, given their multifactorial nature and the long latency of many occupational diseases. All injuries or occupational diseases deemed compensable must &quot;arise out of&quot; or occur &quot;in the course of&quot; or &quot;have been triggered by&quot; employment, even if manifest and detected years later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of an injured worker</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for workers' compensation has some fundamental similarities to United States Social Security Administration (SSA) disability evaluation. The initial step for workers' compensation evaluations is impairment assessment. Clinicians commonly are asked to also evaluate work-related disability.</p><p>In the case of an undisputed work-related injury, the clinician is commonly asked to document the impairment, functional limitations, duration of limitation, the disability, and ability to return to work. As an example, an assessment of a right-hand dominant worker who developed right-sided carpal tunnel syndrome in the course of work might appear as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment: right carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional limitation: inability to bend the right wrist repeatedly, or perform repetitive finger use associated with high force, long duration, and extremes of wrist motion and vibration. Keep the wrists straight as much as possible. Minimize repetitive, strong grasping or pinching objects with the thumb. Take frequent hand and wrist breaks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of disability: temporary pending surgical evaluation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disability: disabled from any work requiring repetitive finger use associated with high force, long duration, and extremes of wrist motion and vibration in the dominant hand.</p><p/><p>In the case of a right-handed machine operator with repetitive hand use, this would likely constitute total work disability but might result in no disability for a telephone operator who works with a headset and does not need to use his or her hands for repetitive activity.</p><p>If the worker were thought to have a permanent impairment, the clinician would be asked to assess the permanent functional loss. This is commonly a percentage of the body part or whole person function, referred to as an impairment rating. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (&quot;Guides&quot;) developed impairment percentages to reflect the impact of the impairment on the ability to perform activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some states use the AMA &quot;Guides&quot; percentage of permanent impairment as a direct proxy for disability and award monetary settlements for permanent loss directly from those percentages, although the &quot;Guides&quot; specifically discourage this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Other states use these percentages of impairment as one component of an assessment, also considering factors including vocation, age, and education before determining a disability award. Some states, such as New York, have used their own guidelines to evaluate the extent of loss of use for extremities or sense organs, referred to as a &quot;schedule loss of use.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;Guides&quot; can serve as a useful and, in some states, required reference for clinicians to use in their evaluation and documentation of permanent impairment and its contribution to disability. However, the &quot;Guides&quot; have significant limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They do not directly estimate work disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical criteria are not solely evidence-based.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment percentage ratings are consensus-based and have varied over time, with decreased impairment ratings being the general trend, given increased overall health care costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of the clinician</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the clinician in workers' compensation is to fulfill their state's requirements for evaluating and treating an injured worker. The clinician can usually download required criteria and forms from their state's worker compensation website. Some states require the clinician be authorized or credentialed by the state's workers' compensation board in order to evaluate workers' compensation patients.</p><p>The worker's compensation process usually requires the clinician to perform the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the particular state or federal workers' compensation regulation in effect. The appropriate workers' compensation guideline is based upon the employer and the employee location at the time of the work related injury or illness. Federal employees are covered under the Federal Employment Compensation Act. Most injured nonfederal workers are covered under their state workers' compensation legislation. However, railroad workers engaged in interstate commerce are covered under The Federal Employment Liability Act (FELA) and miners suffering from &quot;black lung&quot; (pneumoconiosis) are covered under the Black Lung Benefits Act. Often, police and firefighters may be covered under separate workers' compensation regulations, with certain occupational diseases being more readily accepted as occupational due to anticipated exposures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate the individual worker's medical impairments and functional abilities based upon the jurisdiction or state requirements. States may require that the clinician use a particular edition of the AMA &quot;Guides&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50347 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If requested, assess disability, checking whether the clinician is required to use the state workers' compensation board guidelines or can use their choice of validated disability assessment tools (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Disability assessment tools'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To determine if the patient can perform a particular job, request that the employer provide the occupational requirements or the specific job description. If one is unavailable or irrelevant, use the O*NET system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], a key source for comprehensive occupational information regarding occupations and their included tasks, skills, work activities and work context. Other sources include the Dictionary of Occupational Titles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess and document whether the worker has the functional ability to meet the essential requirements of their occupation without harm to themselves or others, or if the essential job responsibilities can be performed with a reasonable workplace accommodation. For example, does an injured worker have sufficient cardiac reserve to safely do moderate work as defined by a recent stress test. If not, the clinician can request a reasonable accommodation be made to incorporate a lower level of physical ability. An injured worker who can currently do only occasional overhead work following shoulder surgery may be able to return to work with accommodations. The employer is responsible for evaluating and meeting a request for workplace accommodation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians may also be asked to comment on whether a patient has the medical ability to do other types of work in lieu of their usual customary work. This requires the clinicians to express an opinion on residual functional capacity, but not on specific alternative jobs. As an example, a clinician might state that a patient could not do her usual work of frequent lifting &gt;25 lbs and bending as a licensed practical nurse, and that her functional capacity is limited to sedentary work as described by State guidelines. The clinician should not specifically state that the patient could work as a receptionist; the determination of whether there are other jobs for the patient is an administrative question best addressed by a vocational expert.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of the clinician in disability evaluation is to define and document findings related to the individual's medical problems and associated functional limitations, and to collate information from different sources into a coherent picture of the individual's medical conditions and functional ability. Most agencies, like the Social Security Administration, recognize that treating clinicians can provide the best evidence for the existence of medical impairments and their consequences. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinician role'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in disability evaluation is the determination of medical impairment and its impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. Impairment has been defined as loss of use or derangement of a body structure or function, and is not synonymous with disability. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disability, the inability to engage in complex or gainful activity due to physical or mental impairment, is a result of the interaction between the impaired individual and the environment in which they function. Clinicians contribute to the determination of disability through their assessment of impairment, associated functional impairments, and any impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living and work. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the purposes of the Social Security Administration, disability may be determined in several ways. Individuals who have &quot;severe&quot; impairment, as defined by disease-specific criteria in the Blue Book Listing of Impairments, are considered to be disabled and do not require a full evaluation process. &quot;Medical equivalence&quot; is recognized when multiple impairments result in functional limitations equal in severity to the requirements of a listing. Based on objective medical findings, other individuals may have sufficiently reduced &quot;residual functional capacity&quot; to qualify for disability. Proper documentation is essential to facilitate the disability process. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'The Social Security Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While there are no tests with sufficient reliability, validity, or sensitivity to classify applicants as unable to work, tools can serve as useful adjuncts to the clinician's medical judgment. Condition-specific assessment tools are available to evaluate patients with functional limitations following low back pain, knee or hip replacement, or with nonspecific pain. The functional capacity evaluation, usually performed by a physical or occupational therapist, can provide information on job-specific maximum work ability. New advances in Computerized Adaptive Testing show promise. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Disability assessment tools'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worker's compensation is federally mandated but criteria and administration are state-specific for most nonfederal jobs.
