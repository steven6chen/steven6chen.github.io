This disorder is differentiated from all other forms of HL, which are commonly referred to as classical HL, by characteristic pathologic and clinical features.</p><p>NLPHL represents a more indolent disease than classical HL, and is therefore managed uniquely. Since this disease is so uncommon, most information concerning treatment and outcome has come from reports of single institutions or pooled, multi-institutional retrospective analyses.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, pathology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of NLPHL are reviewed here. Treatment and prognosis of NLPHL are discussed separately as is the diagnosis of classical HL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 percent of patients initially diagnosed with HL have the uncommon variant NLPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of NLPHL in the United States and Europe has been stable at approximately 8 to 9 cases per 10,000,000 people per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. For unknown reasons, an increase in incidence among children has been noted.</p><p>Approximately 75 percent of patients with NLPHL are male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The age distribution has two peaks: one in children and one in adults, the latter with a median age of 30 to 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Unlike classical HL, NLPHL is more common in the United States among African-Americans compared with Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>NLPHL occurs with higher than expected frequency among first-degree family members of patients with NLPHL. This was demonstrated in an analysis of 692 patients with NLPHL and their 4280 first-degree relatives included in the Finnish Cancer Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Review by hematopathologists confirmed a diagnosis of NLPHL, classical HL, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 9, 15, and 35 first-degree relatives, respectively. When compared with age-, sex-, and race-matched persons from the general population, relatives of patients with NLPHL had a significantly higher rate of developing NLPHL (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 19; 95% CI 8.8-36), classical HL (SIR 5.3; 95% CI 3-8.8), and NHL (SIR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). In contrast, the incidence of cancer overall was not increased (SIR 1.1; 95% CI 1.1-1.2).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of NLPHL is unclear. The neoplastic cell, usually referred to as a lymphohistiocytic or L&amp;H Reed-Sternberg cell variant, is a germinal center B cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These cells have productive immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, and show evidence of ongoing somatic hypermutation of their immunoglobulin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Consistent with these observations, neoplastic L&amp;H variants are typically found within expanded B cell follicles that are rich in follicular dendritic cells and an unusual population of <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4+/CD57+</span> T cells. </p><p>There is little known about the genetic changes that underlie this tumor. Like other germinal center B cell tumors, rearrangements of the BCL6 gene are observed in a minority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It has been proposed that somatic hypermutation in L&amp;H cells mistargets SOCS1, a negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling, in some cases, leading to hyperactivation of STAT6 in the L&amp;H cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One study that used targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize genomic changes in two cases of NLPHL associated with large cell transformation confirmed the existence of SOCS1 mutations and also identified mutations in the transcription factor JunB, the dual phosphatase DUSP2, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> kinase SGK1 that were common to the L&amp;H cells and the associated diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The contributions of these abnormalities to the pathogenesis of NLPHL remain to be ascertained. </p><p>Although both NLPHL and classical HL are malignant lymphomas of germinal center B cell origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], these disorders behave very differently due in part to variations in cross-talk with surrounding reactive cells, which make up the bulk of the tumor in all forms of HL. The growth and survival of NLPHL cells, like normal germinal center B cells, appears to depend on signals produced by the immunoglobulin receptor within the milieu of the expanded B cell follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is likely that dendritic cells and a special subset of follicular T cells (described under morphology) contribute to L&amp;H cell growth and survival.</p><p>Because L&amp;H cells do not appear to be a rich source of cytokines and chemokines, systemic symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, which are common in classical HL, are typically absent in NLPHL. In contrast to NLPHL, the growth and survival of the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical HL is independent of immunoglobulin receptor signaling, and instead depends on alternative receptors, such as CD30 and CD40, that activate the transcription factor NF-kB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Moreover, the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical HL produce a broad array of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that have both local and systemic effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The Reed-Sternberg cell and the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Certain non-malignant architectural changes have been described in patients who eventually develop NLPHL. These lymph node abnormalities include reactive follicular hyperplasia or progressive transformation of germinal centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Whether this association has any pathogenic significance is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in adults&quot;, section on 'Uncommon causes'</a>.)</p><p>T <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/histiocyte-rich</span> B cell lymphoma <span class=\"nowrap\">(T/HRBCL)</span> is a variant of diffuse large B cell lymphoma that has a similar morphology and an identical immunophenotype to NLPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some advocate that these tumors may be a biologic continuum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], in which <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCLs</span> represents tumors that have lost their dependence on trophic factors produced within B cell follicles. In line with this view, NLPHL may transform to tumors closely resembling <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL,</span> an event that is associated with the loss of background dendritic cells.</p><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the pathogenesis of classical HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18-20</a>], but has no role in NLPHL.

NLPHL tends to present as a chronic, asymptomatic lymphadenopathy involving peripheral lymph nodes above or below the diaphragm rather than central lymph node sites. Affected lymph nodes are often easily detected by physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

Patients with NLPHL rarely complain of B-type symptoms (fever, drenching night sweats, weight loss) at the time of initial presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Criteria for B symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spleen (8 percent) and liver (2 to 3 percent) involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. Routine laparotomy is no longer considered standard in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. When performed, upstaging occurs in a small percentage of patients with NLPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

One study of 275 patients diagnosed with nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma found seven patients with purely nodular NLPHL and bone marrow involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Subsequent classification systems, principally the REAL and WHO schemes, have been developed that rely upon both morphology and immunophenotype. A proposed but not yet widely accepted classification system, named the InterLymph classification scheme, differs from REAL and WHO classifications and was developed to facilitate analysis of retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Among all existing systems, the WHO classification is the schema most commonly used.

The term &quot;popcorn cell&quot; is sometimes used for these cells because its nucleus resembles an exploded popcorn kernel.

Because this is an uncommon disease, it is most reliably diagnosed by experienced hematopathologists.</p><p>We rely upon the following to diagnose NLPHL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of L&amp;H cells within the background of a fully or partially nodular growth pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Background cells consisting of small B cells, CD3+CD4+CD57+ T cells, and CD21+ CD23+ follicular dendritic cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic L&amp;H cell immunophenotype. These cells are usually CD20+, BLC6+, CD15-, and CD30-. An expanded set of markers, including epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and other B cell markers, such as CD79a and the transcription factors BOB-1 and OCT-2, can be helpful in difficult cases.</p><p/><p>Prior to the routine use of immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic tools, a number of lymphomas, including NLPHL, classical HL, and certain non-Hodgkin lymphomas, were easily confused with one another. This was best illustrated in a study from the European Task Force on Lymphomas (ETFL), in which clinical data and biopsy material was collected from 426 patients with presumed NLPHL based upon the Rye classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After the biopsy specimens were meticulously reviewed using the stringent morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria of the REAL classification system, 51 percent were confirmed to be NLPHL, while the remainder was reclassified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51531 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>This study emphasizes the importance of careful pathologic study of all new diagnoses of NLPHL and also supports the reevaluation of the initial pathology of NLPHL patients who later develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma thought to be transformed NLPHL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Transformation to NHL'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of NLPHL includes both non-malignant and malignant causes of lymphadenopathy. In particular, it is important to distinguish NLPHL from other lymphomas that require a different treatment approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57098 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Benign and malignant causes of lymphadenopathy that can be confused with NLPHL follow below. Particular attention is given to those malignancies that most closely resemble NLPHL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with NLPHL present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. Causes of lymphadenopathy are varied and include those that are infectious, autoimmune, benign, and malignant. A general approach to lymphadenopathy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactive hyperplasia or PTGC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive transformation of germinal centers (PTGC) is an uncommon condition, often presenting as unexplained, asymptomatic, persistent or recurrent lymphadenopathy. PTGC is characterized by the presence in a lymph node of one or more nodules three to five times the size of a typical reactive follicle, with a predominance of small mantle zone B cells, as well as disruption and eventual replacement of the germinal center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. While PTGC and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma are often associated, and some patients with PTGC may develop lymphoma at a later date, PTGC is not considered to be a premalignant condition. It may be associated with chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions.</p><p>The distinction between NLPHL and PTGC lies in the L&amp;H cells, which are only present in NLPHL. L&amp;H cells may be only seen focally and thus missed on initial review. Biopsies showing reactive hyperplasia or PTGC should be re-evaluated to make certain that a diagnosis of NLPHL is not inadvertently missed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell/HRBCL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/histiocyte-rich</span> B cell lymphoma <span class=\"nowrap\">(T/HRBCL)</span> is a variant of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. It can be very difficult to distinguish from NLPHL because the two have a very similar morphology and an identical immunophenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some advocate that these tumors may be a biologic continuum since some cases are impossible to accurately characterize as one or the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The 2016 revisions to the WHO Classification acknowledged that NLPHL occasionally transforms to a tumor identical in appearance and immunophenotype to <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL;</span> it is recommended that such cases be diagnosed as <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL-like</span> transformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In new presentations, it is important to try to distinguish between NLPHL and <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL</span> since they behave and are treated very differently. While NLPHL usually presents as low-stage disease and follows an indolent course, most cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL</span> present as high-stage disease and have a much poorer outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>As with NLPHL, <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL</span> tumors contain scattered neoplastic CD20-positive B cells within a reactive background. In addition, the neoplastic cells in <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL</span> can closely resemble L&amp;H cells, as well as centroblasts, immunoblasts, or classic Reed-Sternberg cells.</p><p>The key differentiating features are the composition of the background cells and the growth pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57098 \">table 2</a>). In NLPHL, small B cells, CD3+CD4+CD57+ T cells, and follicular dendritic cells are commonly found in the background. In <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL</span> the background is mostly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. Follicular dendritic cells are absent. While the growth pattern in NLPHL is at least partially nodular, the growth pattern in <span class=\"nowrap\">T/HRBCL</span> is diffuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>]. Because growth pattern is difficult to definitively ascertain in core needle biopsies, lymph node biopsy may be necessary to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphocyte-rich classical HL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma (LRCHL), a variant of classical HL, can be difficult to distinguish from NLPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. LRCHL often has a similar clinical presentation to NLPHL; in both entities, early stage disease, non-bulky disease and an absence of B symptoms predominate. LRCHL has a slightly better prognosis than other subtypes of classical HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Morphologically, LRCHL contains classical neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells among a background of small lymphocytes. Growth is usually in a nodular pattern but can be diffuse.</p><p>The key distinguishing feature of LRCHL is the immunophenotype of the malignant cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57098 \">table 2</a>). Unlike NLPHL, LRCHL malignant cells have the immunophenotypic pattern of classical HL. In addition, about 40 percent of LRCHLs are Epstein-Barr virus positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57079 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the diagnosis of NLPHL is confirmed, the patient should undergo a work-up and staging evaluation similar to that performed for patients with classical HL. Staging is performed using the Ann Arbor staging system with Cotswolds modifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. This system is described at length separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed history should include documentation of the presence or absence of B-type symptoms and a complete physical examination should include careful evaluation of all lymph node stations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood work is necessary as part of the initial evaluation. This provides prognostic data such as the calculation of the International Prognostic Score (IPS), and also helps detect involvement of bone and possible liver and kidney dysfunction to aid in treatment decisions. However, in practice these studies are not usually helpful as most patients present with early stage disease.</p><p>Recommended studies include: complete blood cell count with differential, chemistries including calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, serum alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults#H112049651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;, section on 'International prognostic score'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography (CT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate staging guides therapy and should include an intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate the extent of disease. PET imaging may not provide useful additional information over CT scans in the staging of patients with NLPHL. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'PET scan'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow involvement is rare in NLPHL, being present in only 1 to 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4,28,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28,47</a>]. Accordingly, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate should be considered only for patients with stage IIB to IV disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As is true for patients with classical HL, staging laparotomy with splenectomy is no longer considered standard in the evaluation of a patient with NLPHL for several reasons. Since the spleen is rarely involved in NLPHL, the adverse risks associated with splenectomy outweigh possible benefits. Moreover, the staging information obtained by CT scanning is usually adequate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">PET scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to its use in classical HL, the value of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging in NLPHL is unclear. FDG-PET has been shown to be sensitive for disease detection in patients with classical HL and is used for baseline studies and to assess response to therapy in this population. However, the FDG-avidity of NLPHL may be difficult to distinguish from the background FDG-avidity of benign, reactive lymphadenopathy, follicular hyperplasia, or progressive transformation of germinal centers (PTGC). With these caveats in interpretation, we and others often use FDG-PET in the initial staging of patients with NLPHL and as part of our response assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. We do not use FDG-PET for routine follow-up of patients post-therapy. Biopsy is required at the time of recurrence to rule out hyperplasia or PTGC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is an uncommon subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Approximately 5 percent of patients initially diagnosed with HL have the uncommon variant NLPHL. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of NLPHL is unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that the neoplastic cell, usually referred to as a lymphohistiocytic or L&amp;H Reed-Sternberg cell variant, is a germinal B cell. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NLPHL tends to present as a chronic, asymptomatic lymphadenopathy involving peripheral lymph nodes above or below the diaphragm, which are often easily detected by physical examination. A mediastinal mass is only present in 2 to 7 percent. Mediastinal, splenic, liver, and bone marrow involvement is uncommon. Likewise, B symptoms are present in less than 15 percent of patients. The majority of patients with NLPHL present with stage I to II disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of NLPHL uses the World Health Organization classification and relies upon a combination of characteristic morphologic features on lymph node biopsy plus immunophenotyping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57079 \">table 1</a>). Evaluation of the lymph node biopsy reveals a fully or partially nodular growth pattern with morphologic evidence of L&amp;H cells with the characteristic L&amp;H cell immunophenotype (CD20+, BCL6+, CD15-, and CD30-) within a background consisting of small B cells, CD3+CD4+CD57+ T cells, and CD21+ CD23+ follicular dendritic cells.
