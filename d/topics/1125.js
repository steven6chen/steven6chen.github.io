(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>The growth plate or physis represents a major anatomical difference between adult and pediatric bone. Growing long bones in children and younger adolescents are composed of the following segments: diaphysis (shaft), metaphysis (where the bone flares), physis (growth plate), and epiphysis (secondary ossification center) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Growth plates mark a weak point in pediatric bone and are susceptible to fracture. Because the tensile strength of pediatric bone is less than that of the ligaments, the same injury mechanism that causes a ligamentous injury in adults (ligamentous sprain, strain, or tear) is more likely to cause a bone injury in children: The physis will separate from the epiphysis, creating a physeal fracture before disruption or &quot;spraining&quot; of an adjacent strong and flexible ligament. After closure of the physis, the tensile strength of bone exceeds that of the ligaments and ligamentous injury without bone injury occurs more commonly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Physeal (growth plate)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Physeal fracture description'</a>.)</p><p>In general, physeal closure around the knee occurs in late adolescence. However, the timing of physeal closure varies in individual patients and by bone and patient sex. The typical age of physeal closure of the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal fibula, and tibial tuberosity are provided in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99729 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234113727\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234113734\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For this topic, acute injury refers to sudden trauma (eg, a collision between players, a fall while riding a bicycle, or a motor vehicle collision). Of note, some chronic conditions may become apparent during evaluation for an traumatic injury, such as a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) or a septic arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H714710194\" class=\"local\">'Referred pain'</a> below and <a href=\"#H714712045\" class=\"local\">'Systemic disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234113741\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pain is distinguished by duration. For most musculoskeletal conditions, pain for less than six weeks is usually described as acute or subacute, while pain lasting longer than six weeks is typically characterized as chronic. While the six-week threshold is arbitrary, it can be useful because many self-limited injuries heal by the end of six weeks with appropriate rest. Acute pain typically has no progressive pattern. In response to a particular trauma, acute pain flares, lasts a predictable period, and then subsides as healing occurs.</p><p>Chronic knee pain in children and skeletally immature adolescents is discussed separately.

Based upon emergency department visits, the incidence in children and adolescents ranges from 3 to 12 knee injuries per 1000 persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

In the United States, American football, basketball, and soccer account for the largest proportion of sports-related knee injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Although fractures occur more frequently in children and skeletally immature adolescents than in skeletally mature adolescents and adults, ligamentous sprains or strains are still the most common injury in these patients, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are the most common condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In this situation, the proximal fracture fragment can be driven posterior into the popliteal fossa where it can damage popliteal vessels and the common peroneal or posterior tibial nerves. Alternatively, when a valgus-type force is applied directly to the lateral side of the distal femur as with American football injuries, it generally results in a Salter-Harris Type II or III fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83180 \">figure 5</a>). These fractures frequently have an associated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear with knee instability. Less commonly, they may be open fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-femoral-fractures-in-children#H10435814\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal femoral fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of a distal femur fracture will usually be suspected based upon the history of a high-energy mechanism with physical examination findings of pain and swelling around the distal femur and knee (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83181\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83181 \">picture 1</a>). Patients with distal femur fractures will often be in severe pain and unable to bear weight. Associated hamstring muscle spasms will cause the knee to be flexed with resultant obvious knee deformity. A careful neurovascular examination is imperative. Due to the risk of vascular compromise associated with distal femoral fractures, the soft tissues around the knee must also be examined for compartment syndrome at the initial presentation and subsequently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Initial evaluation of a suspected distal femur fracture should include standard anterior posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the knee and entire femur, including the hip, to determine fracture line, degree of displacement and to rule-out an associated knee dislocation.

Suspected dislocations warrant emergent imaging with plain radiographs and reduction followed by careful neurovascular assessment, including arterial imaging (eg, Doppler flow study, Computed tomographic angiogram, or arteriography of the popliteal artery). If emergent imaging is not available, then reduction should be attempted and transfer to a facility with vascular surgery, vascular radiology, and orthopedic surgery expertise should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;, section on 'Postreduction management'</a>.)</p><p>Knee dislocations are most common after high-velocity trauma (eg, motor vehicle accident or fall from height) but can occur with low-velocity trauma in contact sports. Mechanisms of injury include hyperextension, valgus rotary stress, and varus rotary stress. Knee dislocations result from the rupture of at least two, but usually three, of the four major ligaments, resulting in multidirectional instability. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) usually are involved, although this is not always the case. Most knee dislocations are anterior or posterior, with the direction of dislocation indicating the movement of the tibia relative to the femur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p>Knee dislocations usually are obvious when there is gross deformity of the knee. Although in children and adolescents with an obvious deformity, displaced fractures may look like a knee dislocation. Knee dislocations that have reduced spontaneously may be more subtle. Thus, whenever it is clear from the initial evaluation that two ligaments have ruptured (the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACL/medial</span> collateral ligament [MCL] combination is most common), the possibility of a spontaneously reduced knee dislocation must be considered and the neurovascular status of the lower extremity carefully monitored. It is important to inquire about the mechanism and the position of the leg immediately following the injury, and whether it changed subsequently. Complications of knee dislocation include popliteal artery and peroneal nerve injury, which occur primarily after anterior-posterior and lateral dislocations, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50856 \">figure 6</a>).

If indicated, radiographs should be obtained prior to performing provocative maneuvers or having the patient bear weight or walk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100537\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100537 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H538637006\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inspection</strong> &ndash; The legs should be fully exposed. The overall position of the leg and presence of gross deformities should be noted; comparison with the opposite knee may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Gross deformity should alert the clinician to a potentially limb-threatening injury. (See <a href=\"#H1225372\" class=\"local\">'Limb-threatening injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The skin and soft tissues should be inspected for erythema, swelling, abrasions, laceration, puncture wound, bruising, and foreign body. Swelling within 24 hours of an acute knee injury suggests internal derangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurovascular</strong> &ndash; The neurovascular status should be evaluated in all patients with acute knee injury and is of utmost importance in patients with gross deformities. Emergent involvement of an orthopedic surgeon with pediatric expertise and, whenever possible, a vascular surgeon is warranted for all patients in whom popliteal artery compromise is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The neurovascular examination includes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Palpation of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses and comparison to the unaffected leg to evaluate vascular integrity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Examination of the popliteal fossa for an expanding hematoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessment of sensation in the web space between the first and second toes, and ability to actively extend the great toe to evaluate deep peroneal nerve function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessment of sensation of the plantar surface of the foot and ability to actively plantarflex the ankle to evaluate posterior tibial nerve function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ability to evert the ankle to evaluate superficial peroneal nerve function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neurovascular injury occurs most commonly in knee dislocations and displaced fractures. It is uncommon after ligamentous injury, even if two ligaments are injured. However, the varus stress caused by simultaneous injury to the LCL and one of the cruciate ligaments can be sufficient to injure the superficial peroneal nerve. (See <a href=\"#H1225372\" class=\"local\">'Limb-threatening injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpation</strong> &ndash; For patients who have no gross deformity and whose neurovascular integrity is intact, the physical examination should proceed by asking the patient to indicate, with one finger, the most painful spot. The distal femur, femoral condyles, proximal tibia, and entire patella should be palpated for possible fracture. Patients who have bony point tenderness or tenderness proximal to the joint lines (suggesting fracture) should have the extremity immobilized and undergo plain radiography. (See <a href=\"#H538637006\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Range of motion</strong> &ndash; Once a fracture has been excluded based upon physical findings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plain radiographs, range of motion of the knee should be evaluated by asking the patient to flex and extend the knee. Patients without full active range of motion should undergo passive assessment of flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61856 \">picture 10</a>) and full passive extension). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527022\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Range of motion and muscle flexibility'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The bounce home test is another test of knee extension. It is performed with the patient supine. The knee is passively flexed to approximately 15 degrees and then permitted to fall into extension with gravity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55603 \">figure 12</a>). The test is positive if the knee does not fully extend (known as &quot;true locking&quot;). True locking can be caused by a displaced torn meniscal flap, a loose intraarticular body, articular surface damage, or a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ligaments</strong> &ndash; Tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laxity suggests a ligamentous injury (sprain), the severity of which is graded by the degree of laxity for the specific ligament. The grades of sprains are easiest to determine in the immediate post-injury period before the onset of swelling and secondary muscle spasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Assessing joint stability'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Meniscus</strong> &ndash; Meniscal tear is suggested by joint line tenderness, joint effusion, loss of smooth passive motion, inability to fully extend the knee, inability to kneel or squat, palpable catching at the joint line as detected by the McMurray maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91072\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91072 \">picture 9</a>) or pain elicited by provocative testing (eg, Thessaly test). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniscal-injury-of-the-knee#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniscal injury of the knee&quot;, section on 'Provocative testing'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscles</strong> &ndash; The muscles about the knee should be inspected for swelling and ecchymosis and palpated for signs of tenderness. The integrity of the quadriceps mechanism and quadriceps strength are assessed by asking the patient to extend the leg against resistance placed at the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81977\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81977 \">picture 11</a>). Within a few days of disuse, quadriceps tone becomes notably reduced. Limited muscle contraction may be caused by effusion, pain, or mechanical obstruction; internal derangement should be suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H294133455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Quadriceps strength'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gait</strong> &ndash; The gait of the patient in whom the initial evaluation does not suggest fracture or dislocation should be observed to see if he or she is able to bear weight. Movement of the knee is painful and guarded in patients with internal derangement (ie, fracture, chondral lesion, injury to the cruciate or collateral ligaments, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> menisci). Patients with these injuries usually have little spontaneous knee movement and are unable to bear weight, particularly if more than one structure is involved (eg, the medial meniscus and ACL).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637006\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H644399424\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs are indicated for children and skeletally immature adolescents who have one or more of the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross deformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large knee effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable tenderness over the femoral or tibial physis, fibular head, or patella</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to bear weight or to walk four steps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern for laceration or penetrating injury extending into the knee joint</p><p/><p>Specific views should be ordered depending upon the site of injury.

Prior to radiographs, the patient should undergo careful evaluation of the hip and ankle. Those patients with abnormal findings should undergo hip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ankle radiographs. Hip pathology can frequently cause pain that is referred to the knee. (See <a href=\"#H714710194\" class=\"local\">'Referred pain'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with complicated fractures of the patella, distal femur, or proximal tibia may require additional imaging (eg, computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to fully characterize the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

It can also identify evidence of patellar dislocation in patients with spontaneous reduction. MRI is not necessary in all children and skeletally immature adolescents with acute internal derangement but should be used if the diagnosis is in question, if they do not improve with conservative treatment, or if the plan is to undergo diagnostic arthroscopy only if the MRI is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

MRI is not necessary in all children and skeletally immature adolescents with clinical findings of these injuries, but should be used if the diagnosis is in question or if the plan is to undergo diagnostic arthroscopy only if the MRI is abnormal. Clinicians who are unskilled in the knee examination should consult with a sports medicine physician or orthopedic surgeon with training in sports medicine before obtaining an MRI.
