While stress testing can be performed in a variety of ways, the most commonly used and widely available stress testing modalities are exercise electrocardiography (ECG; non-imaging) and exercise or pharmacologic stress combined with imaging (stress echocardiography or stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging [MPI]). </p><p>The choice of stress testing modality depends on many factors, including but not limited to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to perform adequate exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting ECG</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical indication for performing the test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient's body habitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior coronary revascularization</p><p/><p>This topic will review the indications for stress testing and the choice of stress testing modality with emphasis on considerations for the type of stress (exercise versus pharmacologic) and the assessment of response (ECG, echocardiography, or radionuclide imaging). The technique and efficacy of these procedures, as well as cardiopulmonary exercise testing for other indications, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458218799\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR STRESS TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with symptoms suggesting coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiac stress testing is most often indicated to aid in making the diagnosis of and assessing risk related to CHD. In some patients with known CHD and prior coronary revascularization or a change in clinical status, stress testing is indicated for the diagnosis of new or progressive disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for risk stratification. In addition to symptomatic patients with known or suspected CHD, patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or planned non-cardiac surgery may be candidates for stress testing. In contrast, cardiac stress testing as a screening test for CHD in asymptomatic patients is rarely indicated.</p><p>Guidelines for stress testing have been proposed by several professional societies, and our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with symptoms suggesting angina &ndash; Patients who have symptoms suggestive of angina and who have an intermediate or high pre-test likelihood of CHD are generally appropriate for stress testing. One exception to this is patients with ongoing or unstable symptoms, in which case stress testing should not be performed prior to relief of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H1220523363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute chest pain &ndash; Patients presenting with acute chest pain or suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may also undergo stress testing for the diagnosis of possible CHD. Stress testing in such patients should only be performed following the relief of symptoms and following the evaluation for ACS or infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a recent ACS &ndash; In patients with a prior ACS who were treated conservatively without coronary angiography, or in patients with incomplete revascularization at the time of ACS, stress testing may be used for risk assessment within three months post-ACS, assuming that the patient is stable without further symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with known CHD and new or worsening symptoms &ndash; Cardiac stress testing may be appropriate for patients with known CHD if there has been a clinical change (ie, new or worsening symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with prior coronary revascularization &ndash; In the absence of new or changing symptoms &lt;5 years after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or &lt;2 years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stress testing is rarely appropriate. However, for patients &ge;5 years after CABG or &ge;2 years after PCI, stress testing may be appropriate on a one-time basis for the asymptomatic patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with valvular heart disease &ndash; Stress echocardiography may be performed to evaluate valvular heart disease, such as severe mitral stenosis without symptoms, moderate mitral stenosis with symptoms, severe mitral or aortic regurgitation (when left ventricular size and function do not meet surgical criteria), and equivocal aortic stenosis in the setting of low-cardiac output or left ventricular systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The exercise electrocardiography (ECG) without imaging may also be used to assess exercise capacity and need for valvular intervention in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-echocardiography#H406169795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress echocardiography&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with newly diagnosed heart failure or cardiomyopathy &ndash; Stress testing is indicated and appropriate to evaluate for ischemic heart disease as the cause for heart failure or a cardiomyopathy of uncertain etiology, assuming that coronary angiography has not already been planned or performed. Even if angiography has already been performed, stress testing may still be indicated to determine whether the myocardium is viable and to plan the revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction and CHD who are candidates for revascularization &ndash; Stress testing with imaging can identify myocardial ischemia and regions of viable myocardium. This information may be helpful in the discussion of planned revascularization and may help predict contractile recovery and outcomes following revascularization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of myocardial viability by nuclear imaging in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with select arrhythmias &ndash; Exercise stress testing can be helpful in the identification of chronotropic incompetence, determining the appropriate setting in patients with rate-adaptive pacemakers, evaluation of patients with congenital complete heart block considering increased physical activity, evaluation of patients with known or suspected exercise-induced arrhythmia (eg, congenital long QT syndrome and other channelopathies), and evaluation of the efficacy of therapy in patients with exercise-induced arrhythmia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75011 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery &ndash; Patients requiring emergency noncardiac surgery should undergo surgery without delay, and postoperative risk stratification and management should be performed. For preoperative evaluation of patients prior to elective noncardiac surgery, patients with active cardiac conditions should undergo evaluation and treatment prior to the planned surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The approach to stress testing and risk assessment prior to noncardiac surgery is discussed in greater detail separately.

Rare exceptions are patients with multiple risk factors and those in high-risk occupations (eg, airline pilots).

Our approach to arriving at the optimal stress test for an individual patient is as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H688184828\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical factors to consider</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to choose a particular stress test over other testing options should be made by incorporating clinical data, potential side effects, costs, and test availability. The choice of an imaging modality, when indicated, also depends on a variety factors, including local availability, local expertise, cost, the patient's body habitus (eg, morbid obesity), limited acoustic windows for echocardiography (only if neither traditional nor contrast-enhanced echocardiographic imaging is adequate), radiation exposure, and the need for concomitant assessment of hemodynamics or valvular disease. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Can the patient exercise to a satisfactory workload?</strong> &ndash; The ability to exercise directly impacts the choice of stress modality. In addition to being able to exercise, patients should be able to exercise to an adequate workload as defined by one or more of several possible variables, including exercise duration, peak heart rate, peak double product, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nearly all patients who are anticipated to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo an exercise stress test rather than a pharmacologic stress test. However, patients who can exercise may also benefit from an imaging modality depending on the clinical scenario. (See <a href=\"#H688184093\" class=\"local\">'Patient can exercise and has a normal ECG'</a> below and <a href=\"#H688184174\" class=\"local\">'Patient can exercise and has abnormal baseline ECG (except LBBB or ventricular pacing)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are unable to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo a pharmacologic stress test with imaging.

As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who require a stress test with imaging may not have access to all imaging modalities (ie, stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging or stress echocardiography not offered locally). In such cases, the best available stress test option should be chosen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients or laboratories may have time constraints that favor one test over another (stress echocardiography or stress-only radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging rather than same-day rest-stress or stress-rest radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients may have a desire or need to avoid radiation exposure (thereby opting for stress echocardiography).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The information obtained from this assessment should allow clinicians to choose from one of the following options to optimize the value of the stress test in a particular patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H688184017\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient cannot exercise to a satisfactory workload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are unable to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo pharmacologic stress testing with myocardial imaging.

Given the availability of modified protocols that begin at lower levels of exertion, there is no predefined level of exercise that a patient has to complete in order to attempt exercise stress testing, although if a person can walk for more than five minutes on flat ground or up one to two flights of stairs without needing to stop, that person most likely can achieve an adequate workload during exercise stress testing.</p><p>Valuable prognostic information can be obtained during exercise stress testing. Exercise variables that have been shown to predict outcomes include exercise duration, ST segment response, chronotropic incompetence, heart rate recovery, and exercise-induced hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

The use of ECG-gating during SPECT or PET image acquisition allows for quantification of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction, as well as assessment of regional wall motion and thickening. The advantages of PET over SPECT include the lower radiation patient exposure (due to the shorter physical half-lives of PET perfusion tracers) and more robust attenuation correction (leading to higher diagnostic accuracy in women and patients with larger body habitus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458218883\"><span class=\"h3\">Stress echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to radionuclide stress myocardial perfusion imaging, stress (exercise or pharmacologic) transthoracic echocardiography is used to detect hemodynamically significant CHD, localize ischemia in patients with known CHD, risk stratify patients, and assess for valvular disease and myocardial viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. The basic concept of stress echocardiography is the detection of ischemia through the development of new regional wall motion abnormalities or worsening of preexisting regional wall motion abnormalities.

Exercise parameters of diastolic function, systolic pulmonary artery pressure responses, and valvular heart disease can be obtained as part of a hemodynamic stress echocardiogram study. In addition, findings of the resting echocardiogram (prior to stress) may provide a prompt diagnosis of the mechanism for symptoms. As an example, the presence of a pericardial effusion may be identified, which may suggest underlying pericarditis as a cause of chest pain.
