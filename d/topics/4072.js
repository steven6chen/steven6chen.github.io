The diagnosis should be considered whenever a patient presents with symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and choking or gasping during sleep, particularly in the presence of risk factors such as obesity, male gender, and advanced age. </p><p>The clinical presentation, clinical features, diagnostic approach, and differential diagnosis of OSA are reviewed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, natural history, and management of OSA are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13336404\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25136776\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with OSA first come to the attention of a clinician because the patient complains of daytime sleepiness, or the bed partner reports loud snoring, gasping, snorting, or interruptions in breathing while sleeping. These symptoms may be presenting complaints, reported during the evaluation of another complaint, detected during health maintenance screening, or reported during preoperative screening. Regardless of how the complaints are identified, all patients who report daytime sleepiness or snoring, gasping, snorting, or interruptions in breathing while sleeping, should be asked about and examined for other features of OSA. This information is important for determining which patients require diagnostic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daytime sleepiness, distinct from fatigue, is a common feature of OSA. Sleepiness is the inability to remain fully awake or alert during the wakefulness portion of the sleep-wake cycle, while fatigue is a subjective lack of physical or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is often unclear whether a patient's complaint of daytime sleepiness represents true sleepiness or fatigue. In such cases, series of directed questions can be combined with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to quantitatively document the patient&rsquo;s perception of sleepiness, fatigue, or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86812 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H362471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Daytime sleepiness may go unnoticed or its significance may be underestimated because of its insidious onset and chronicity. The patient may not describe the symptom as sleepiness, but may use other terms, such as fatigue, tiredness, and low energy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Careful questioning of the patient typically reveals a pattern of feeling sleepy or falling asleep in boring, passive, or monotonous situations. As an example, the patient may admit to consistently falling asleep while reading, watching television, or even while operating a motor vehicle. In addition, embarrassing or inappropriate episodes of sleep (eg, at religious services, while driving) may be reported. Reviewing patient behavior away from the workplace is essential because daytime sleepiness can be masked by activity. Patients should always be asked about behaviors that may mask sleepiness, such as caffeine consumption.</p><p>Snoring is the other common feature of OSA. While snoring is associated with a sensitivity of 80 to 90 percent for the diagnosis of OSA, its specificity is below 50 percent. Moreover, patients with mild snoring and a body mass index (BMI) lower than 26 are unlikely to have moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is usually helpful to have the patient's bed partner or a family member present during the interview because they may have greater insight than the patient into the frequency and severity of the snoring, as well as associated events (ie, resuscitative gasping or snorting, witnessed apneic periods, periods of silence followed by loud snoring, restless or fitful sleep), since these occur during sleep and may help increase the likelihood that snoring is associated with OSA.</p><p>In addition to daytime sleepiness and snoring, the clinician should ask about other symptoms and signs that are suggestive of OSA. As an example, sleep maintenance insomnia with repetitive awakenings should prompt consideration of OSA. A portion of patients with OSA complain of insomnia rather than daytime sleepiness because they are unable to maintain sleep; this phenomenon may be more common in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Morning headaches are reported by 10 to 30 percent of patients with untreated OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. They are usually bifrontal and squeezing in quality, with no associated nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia. They typically occur daily or most days of the week and may last for several hours after awakening in the morning. The cause of the headaches is not well established and may be multifactorial; proposed mechanisms include hypercapnia, vasodilation, increased intracranial pressure, and impaired sleep quality. Some studies have identified higher OSA disease severity as a predictor of headache, although this has not been consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The headaches usually resolve completely within several weeks of initiating positive airway pressure therapy; lack of improvement may suggest an alternative cause of headache.

The complaint of snoring, while common in patients with OSA, was found to have no predictive value in all six studies included in the review.

These include retrognathia, micrognathia, lateral peritonsillar narrowing, macroglossia, tonsillar hypertrophy, an elongated or enlarged uvula, a high arched or narrow palate, nasal septal deviation, and nasal polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The modified Mallampati classification is commonly used to quantify airway narrowing, with classes 3 and 4 considered positive for airway narrowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 1</a>). Both the Mallampati classification and Friedman tongue position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91839\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91839 \">figure 2</a>) have been shown to correlate with OSA severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> waist circumference &ndash; OSA is more strongly correlated with an increased neck size or waist circumference than general obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. OSA is particularly prominent among men who have a collar size greater than 17 inches and women who have a neck size greater than 16 inches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated blood pressure &ndash; Approximately 50 percent of patients with OSA have coexisting hypertension, which is often most elevated in the morning. Similarly, patients with resistant hypertension have a very high prevalence of OSA.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25136797\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individual signs and symptoms have limited utility in determining the likelihood of OSA, and no one clinical feature is sufficiently sensitive or specific to effectively rule in or rule out the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A variety of clinical prediction rules, questionnaires, and scores have been evaluated using common signs and symptoms of OSA that are easily obtained and interpreted in the primary care setting. While these tools may have some value in detecting OSA in highly symptomatic patients in a high-risk setting (eg, preoperative evaluation), they have not been adequately tested as a screening tool in asymptomatic patients and are not recommended for diagnosis. One major limitation is that most scores have been derived from sleep center or preoperative referral-based populations (ie, symptomatic patients), which may have a higher prevalence of OSA; for this reason, the sensitivity and specificity of most instruments are likely overestimated in relation to their value in an unselected asymptomatic community-based population. In addition, there is marked heterogeneity in the way in which OSA is defined in studies testing the validity of screening questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/5,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28</a>]. Further validating their limited use as a screening tool in asymptomatic patients, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed 110 studies evaluating the accuracy of screening questionnaires or prediction tools. The USPSTF found that although some tools could predict the presence of severe OSA, these studies were performed in high risk individuals, rendering them less useful as true screening tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In addition, there were no randomized trials comparing screening with no screening in asymptomatic individuals and no studies that reported improved outcomes in association with their use. The USPSTF concluded that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of these tools for the screening of OSA in asymptomatic individuals in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine also supports not using these tools to diagnose OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>The high false positive rate of questionnaires diminishes their diagnostic value such that when the score is high, patients do not always have OSA; in contrast, when the score is low, patients are unlikely to have OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, questionnaires are sensitive but not specific and are generally only helpful when they are negative (ie, low score). Examples of such questionnaires include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>STOP-Bang &ndash; The STOP-Bang questionnaire is an eight-item survey that incorporates information on <strong>s</strong>noring, <strong>t</strong>iredness, <strong>o</strong>bserved apneas, blood <strong>p</strong>ressure, <strong>B</strong>MI, <strong>a</strong>ge, <strong>n</strong>eck circumference, and <strong>g</strong>ender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87572 \">table 5</a>). A score of three or higher has a sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 56 percent for the diagnosis of OSA using an AHI threshold of &gt;5 events per hour, and a sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 43 percent for an AHI &gt;15 (ie, moderate to severe OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Among the questionnaires, the STOP BANG questionnaire has the highest sensitivity (88 percent for mild OSA, 90 percent for moderate OSA, and 93 percent for severe OSA) but the specificity is poor (42 percent for mild OSA, 36 for moderate OSA, 35 percent for severe OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea clinical score (SACS) &ndash; The SACS is a four-item questionnaire that incorporates information on neck circumference, hypertension, habitual snoring, and nocturnal gasping or choking to generate a score ranging from 0 to 100 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52357 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Scores greater than 15 result in a probability of OSA (defined as an AHI &gt;10 events per hour) of 25 to 50 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Berlin questionnaire &ndash; The Berlin questionnaire consists of 10 items relating to snoring, nonrestorative sleep, sleepiness while driving, apneas during sleep, hypertension, and BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The results stratify patients as having a high or low risk for OSA. A high risk score on the Berlin questionnaire is associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 46 percent when OSA is defined as an AHI &ge;5 events per hour, and 91 and 37 percent when OSA is defined as an AHI &ge;15 events per hour (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91571 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F96753\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96753 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The NoSAS score &ndash; The NoSAS score assigns points based upon four parameters (neck circumference, body mass index, snoring, age, and gender). In a derivation and validation analysis, a score &ge;8 identified individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing with an area under the curve of 0.74, higher than that associated with the STOP-Bang (0,67) and Berlin questionnaires (0.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. While encouraging, this score requires further validation before it can be used in a clinical setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multivariable Apnea Prediction (MVAP) instrument &ndash; The MVAP instrument is based on a formula consisting of three questions about the frequency of symptoms of sleep apnea, along with BMI, age, and sex. MVAP values ranged from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the highest likelihood of sleep apnea. Two studies were performed using this instrument in primary care or community populations: elderly patients complaining of sleepiness, and hypertensive patients visiting an internist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In the Medicare patients with daytime sleepiness, this tool had a sensitivity of 90.9 percent and a specificity of 64.4 percent to predict severe OSA (AHI &ge;30 and ESS score &gt;10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The MVAP tool had a sensitivity of 92 percent and a specificity of 44 percent to predict severe OSA in hypertensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, both study populations likely carry a higher prevalence of OSA, creating a bias in these study results.</p><p/><p>The usefulness of these and other instruments as screening tools in the preoperative evaluation of patients without known OSA is discussed separately.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline advocates that diagnostic testing be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed on any patient with unexplained excessive daytime sleepiness, which is the clinically relevant symptom of OSA that is most responsive to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In the absence of excessive daytime sleepiness, we typically pursue diagnostic testing if the patient snores and either works in a mission-critical profession (eg, airline pilots, bus drivers, and truck drivers) or has two or more additional clinical features of OSA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 3</a>). This approach is illustrated in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F80288\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80288 \">algorithm 1</a>) and assumes that the excessive daytime sleepiness and clinical features are not definitively explained by an alternative etiology.</p><p>For patients who are not known to snore and do not complain of excessive daytime sleepiness, we suggest a low threshold for diagnostic testing in certain high-risk groups, such as patients with resistant hypertension, unexplained pulmonary hypertension, or secondary polycythemia, particularly if they are obese or have other clinical features of OSA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients selected for diagnostic testing, we suggest full-night (ie, diagnostic only) or split-night (ie, diagnostic and therapeutic), attended, in-laboratory polysomnography. Unattended, home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) with a technically adequate device is a reasonable alternative for patients without comorbidities (ie, uncomplicated OSA) and in whom there is a high likelihood of moderate or severe OSA. These diagnostic tests are summarized briefly below and discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polysomnography-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polysomnography in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A meta-analysis of four observational studies reported agreement between sleep and nonsleep specialists on appropriate diagnostic testing and classification of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, many of the nonsleep specialists had extensive training or experience in sleep medicine. Accordingly, in support of AASM guidelines in those with suspected OSA, a comprehensive evaluation by a clinician with some level of expertise in sleep is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An attended, in-laboratory polysomnography is considered the <strong>gold-standard</strong> diagnostic test for OSA.

Split-night studies may be preferred for patients in whom moderate to severe OSA has been identified during a minimum of two hours of polysomnography and in whom at least three hours are available for CPAP titration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Full night studies may be preferred in patients who do not meet these criteria or patients in whom a more complex sleep disturbance is suspected or noted during the diagnostic phase of testing.

In this situation, repeating the polysomnogram is suggested. This is supported by several studies that have demonstrated significant night-to-night variability in polysomnography results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>] and is supported by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Polysomnography (including technique, measured variables, and derived information) is discussed in detail separately.

HSAT should be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with a high pre-test probability of moderate to severe uncomplicated OSA, (ie, absence of medical comorbidities such as significant cardiorespiratory disease or other significant disorders [eg, narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F113434\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113434 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31,42,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,42,47</a>]. Risk of moderate to severe OSA is indicated by the presence of daytime hypersomnolence and at least two of the following three criteria: habitual loud snoring, witnessed apnea or <span class=\"nowrap\">gasping/choking,</span> or diagnosed hypertension. Choosing in-laboratory versus home testing in this population may also be influenced by environmental or personal factors (eg, inability to access a laboratory or home care company, cost, personal preference). Should a single HSAT be negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, and the suspicion remain for OSA, HSAT should not be repeated and in-laboratory polysomnography should be performed; it is rare that a repeat HSAT is indicated. Further details regarding the patients that are suitable or not suitable for HSAT are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>Many HSAT devices have been validated against standard polysomnography, typically by testing the same patient with both modalities in the sleep laboratory. Generally speaking, the sensitivity and specificity seem to be high in populations at high risk of moderate to severe OSA on the basis of clinical symptoms, assuming there are no significant comorbid medical disorders or sleep disorders. The idea that HSAT is a viable alternative to in-laboratory polysomnography in selected individuals is supported by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One unblinded trial randomly assigned 373 patients with suspected moderate to severe OSA to either in-laboratory polysomnography with conventional continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration or HSAT with autotitrating CPAP and then transition to fixed CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Among patients who had moderate to severe OSA (ie, AHI &gt;15 events per hour), there were no differences in the number of effective titrations, titration pressures, time to treatment, or daytime sleepiness. Patients who underwent HSAT with autotitrating CPAP were more likely to use CPAP for &ge;4 hours at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter randomized noninferiority study compared limited data from polysomnography with full polysomnographic data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Data from polysomnogram studies (PSG) were given to sleep physicians at varying levels: level 1 (L1; full PSG data), level 3 (L3; information on airflow, thoracoabdominal bands, body position, electrocardiography, oxygen saturation which simulates data included from in-home studies), and level 4 (L4; oxygen saturation and heart rate). Diagnoses and treatment recommendations were made based upon the information provided and outcomes including the functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire score (FOSQ) were measured. There was no difference in the FOSQ score or in the distribution of initial diagnoses with L1, L3, or L4 testing. However, L4 testing was associated with less improvement in sleepiness, less CPAP use, and lower physician diagnostic confidence. While this study supports in-home-style testing, none of the studies were done at home, which was a major limitation. Further validation with in-home testing is needed. </p><p/><p>There are several devices available for home testing.

However, there are few studies examining the accuracy of such studies in the hospital, given the higher rates of co-morbidities, and whether patient outcomes are modified by earlier detection of OSA in the hospital setting. One study in hospitalized cardiac patients demonstrated significantly fewer readmissions and emergency department visits at 30 days in those undergoing bedside portable studies followed by adherence to positive airway pressure after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of OSA is based upon the presence or absence of related symptoms, as well as the frequency of respiratory events during sleep (ie, apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effort-related arousals [RERAs]) as measured by polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT). In adults, the diagnosis of OSA is confirmed if either of the two conditions exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are five or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events (obstructive and mixed apneas, hypopneas, or RERAs) per hour of sleep (for polysomnography) or recording time (for HSAT) in a patient with one or more of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleepiness, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, or insomnia symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Waking up with breath holding, gasping, or choking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Habitual snoring, breathing interruptions, or both noted by a bed partner or other observer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypertension, mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are 15 or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events (apneas, hypopneas, or RERAs) per hour of sleep (for polysomnography) or recording time (for HSAT), regardless of the presence of associated symptoms or comorbidities. </p><p/><p>Whether the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI = apneas + hypopneas <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> total sleep time in hours) or the respiratory disturbance index (RDI = apneas + hypopneas + RERAs <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> total sleep time in hours) should be the gold standard index remains unclear and varies across insurance carriers. Outcome studies are needed to determine which index is preferred. The main implication of the difference is that the RDI classifies more patients as having OSA than does the AHI, using the same threshold values. In addition, most HSAT devices do not include EEG monitoring, and therefore RERAs and hypopneas characterized by arousals cannot be identified. Accordingly, the number of respiratory events per hour of recording time rather than total sleep time is used to generate the preferred terminology, respiratory event index (REI). In validated portable monitors, the REI correlates well with AHI and RDI. Published reports have used a cutoff REI &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/hour</span> to define pathology, but outcome studies are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Evidence does show that the length of the recording time used to generate the REI with HSAT should be at least 4 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,53</a>].

Such patients may be relatively asymptomatic or report sedentary (ie, passive) daytime sleepiness, becoming noticeable once the patient is unstimulated. The daytime sleepiness often does not impair daily life, although it may be recognized by family members. Alternatively, daytime sleepiness may become apparent to the patient only after it improves due to weight loss, alcohol abstinence, or treatment of OSA. The sleep stages and slow wave sleep are generally preserved in mild OSA, and cardiovascular consequences such as systemic hypertension, cor pulmonale, and polycythemia are generally absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H837023\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients traditionally classified as having moderate OSA are those with an AHI between 15 and 30 respiratory events per hour of sleep. Such patients are typically aware of daytime sleepiness and take steps to avoid falling asleep at inappropriate times (eg, taking a nap or avoiding driving long distances). They are able to continue their daily activities, but at reduced levels, and they may have an increased incidence of motor vehicle violations or accidents. Systemic hypertension may co-exist. Sleep fragmentation is observed in moderate OSA, but the progression of sleep stages is better conserved than with severe disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H837030\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients classified as having severe OSA are those with an AHI greater than 30 respiratory events per hour of sleep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an oxyhemoglobin saturation below 90 percent for more than 20 percent of the total sleep time. Such patients more often have daytime sleepiness that interferes with normal daily activities. They tend to fall asleep often during the day (and in a sitting posture) and are at risk for accidental injury from sleepiness. Patients with severe OSA are at increased risk for all-cause mortality and a variety of cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias.

OSA is confirmed if either of the two conditions exists (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are 15 or more apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals per hour of sleep (ie, an apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] or respiratory disturbance index [RDI] &ge;15 events per hour) in an asymptomatic patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are five or more obstructive apneas, obstructive hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals per hour of sleep (ie, an apnea-hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index &ge;5 events per hour) in a patient with symptoms or signs of disturbed sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who undergo home sleep apnea testing (HSAT), actual sleep time is not recorded such that the respiratory event index (REI) is calculated based on recording time from the HSAT device; REI appears to correlate well with in-laboratory measured AHI and RDI. With a moderate or high suspicion of OSA, REI &ge;15 events per hour is supportive of a diagnosis of sleep apnea while those with an REI &lt;15 events per hour or those with inconclusive results or a technically inadequate study should be evaluated in a laboratory setting.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Multiple Sclerosis Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines.
