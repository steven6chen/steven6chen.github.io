Most blood clots (thrombi) originally form in one of the deep veins of the legs, thighs, or pelvis; this condition is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clot or clots block the blood flow to parts of the lung, preventing oxygen from reaching the brain and body. Pulmonary emboli are uncommon, but can be deadly if not identified and treated promptly. In the United States, it is estimated that over 50,000 people die every year as a result of a PE. Recognizing and treating a PE quickly can reduce the risk of serious complications and death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY EMBOLISM RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of factors that increase a person's risk of developing PE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2120177314\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery and related conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures, especially those involving the hip, pelvis, or knee, increase a person's risk of developing a blood clot. During the recovery period, this risk often continues because the person is less active. Inactivity during long trips can also increase a person's risk of developing a blood clot. Precautions to reduce the risk of blood clots are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Special precautions with pulmonary embolism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical conditions or medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some medical conditions and medications increase a person's risk of developing a blood clot:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immobilization (including neurologic paralysis from a stroke, bedrest, and prolonged periods in the hospital)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous DVT or PE</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medications (eg, birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen, thalidomide, erythropoietin). The risk of a blood clot is further increased in people who use one of these medications and smoke or are overweight.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney problems, such as nephrotic syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-nephrotic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399870807\"><span class=\"h2\">Inherited thrombophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited thrombophilia refers to a genetic problem that causes the blood to clot more easily than normal. Various factors in the blood clotting process may be involved, depending on the type of genetic problem present.</p><p>An inherited thrombophilia, such as deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S, is frequently present in people with a venous blood clot (ie, thrombus) who develop a blood clot before the age of 50, and who do not have another clear precipitant (eg, surgery). Other factors, such as factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene mutation, increase the risk of venous thrombosis in all age groups. However, venous blood clots are infrequent before adolescence.</p><p>If a person is found to have a PE and there is no known medical condition or recent surgery that caused the PE, it is possible that an inherited condition is the cause. This is especially true in people who have more than one PE or if a family member has also experienced a PE. In these cases, testing for an inherited thrombophilia may be recommended. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Determining the cause'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4293912468\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevated clotting factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having an increased level of one or more factors involved in blood clotting, such as factor VIII, increases the risk of a blood clot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired thrombophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some types of thrombophilia are not inherited, but can increase a person's risk of developing a blood clot:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain disorders of the blood, such as polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiphospholipid antibodies (antibodies in the blood that can affect the clotting process) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-antiphospholipid-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The antiphospholipid syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY EMBOLISM SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of PE can vary from one person to another. Common signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath or needing to breathe rapidly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharp, knife-like chest pain while taking a deep breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing or coughing up blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid heart rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness or fainting</p><p/><p>Any of these symptoms along with leg pain or swelling increases the likelihood of PE. In rare cases, the person might pass out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY EMBOLISM DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinician can determine whether a person's signs, symptoms, and risk factors suggest PE. If a person's history, symptoms, and physical exam suggest a PE, tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Tests to diagnose or rule out PE include D-dimer blood testing, spiral computed tomography (CT), <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> lung scanning, and rarely pulmonary angiography. These tests are described in more detail below.</p><p>Some patients with a suspected PE will also undergo testing to determine if DVT exists, which is described in detail in a separate topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). If a DVT is diagnosed, further testing to determine if a PE is present may not be necessary because, most of the time, both conditions are treated in the same way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">D-dimer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>D-dimer is a substance in the blood that is often increased in people with PE. D-dimer levels are abnormal in 95 percent of patients with PE; a person with a normal D-dimer level is unlikely to have a PE. If the D-dimer test is negative and the patient is thought to have a low risk of PE based upon their signs and symptoms, PE is unlikely and further testing may not be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Spiral computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spiral CT scanning uses a combination of x-rays and computers to take detailed pictures of the inside of the body. The patient lies inside a tube-like structure; x-rays are taken after the injection of an intravenous dye, which highlights the vessels in the lung (CT angiography) or the leg veins (CT venography). Spiral CT is the study of choice in medical centers that have experience performing and interpreting the test.</p><p>However, spiral CT may not be suitable for patients with poor kidney function and patients who are unable to have a CT for other reasons (eg, an allergy to contrast dye). These patients usually need an alternate test (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> lung scan) or special treatment to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction before CT angiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilation/perfusion lung scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> lung scan, sometimes called a <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scan, is commonly used to diagnose patients with a suspected PE. During this test, the patient inhales a small amount of a radioactive substance. A radioactive substance is also injected into the bloodstream. A machine is used to examine how these radioactive substances are distributed within the lungs. If a person has a PE, the scanner can detect the area of lung in which the blood flow has been blocked by the blood clot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been significant improvements in non-invasive tests for PE. However, in some circumstances, some patients still require a more invasive test, called pulmonary angiography, to confirm or exclude PE with certainty. &#160;</p><p>Pulmonary angiography is performed by inserting a catheter through a vein in the groin area (the femoral vein). The catheter is guided into a branch of the pulmonary artery. Dye is injected through the catheter, highlighting the blood vessels in the lung on x-ray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After determining that a PE is present, the clinician will want to know what caused it. In many cases, there are obvious risk factors such as recent surgery or immobility (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acquired thrombophilia'</a> above). In other cases, the person will be tested for inherited thrombophilia (see <a href=\"#H399870807\" class=\"local\">'Inherited thrombophilia'</a> above).</p><p>Persons with an acquired or inherited abnormality may require additional treatment or preventative measures to reduce the risk of future blood clots. Some experts recommend that the family members of a person with an inherited thrombophilia be screened for the inherited condition if this information would impact their care, although this issue is controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY EMBOLISM TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for PE help to prevent a new or enlarging blood clot and reduce the risk of complications related to the clot while the body's own enzymes dissolve the clot. The primary treatment for venous thrombosis is anticoagulation. Other treatments include thrombolytic therapy, embolectomy (removal of the clot), and placing a &quot;clot filter&quot; in one of the major blood vessels (the inferior vena cava).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulants are medications that are commonly called &quot;blood thinners.&quot; They do not actually dissolve the clot, but rather help to prevent new blood clots from forming. There are several different medications that might be started immediately after a PE diagnosis (referred to as &quot;initial anticoagulation&quot;), including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low molecular weight heparin, which is given as an injection under the skin &ndash; Options include enoxaparin (brand name: Lovenox), dalteparin (brand name: Fragmin), and tinzaparin (brand name: Innohep).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unfractionated heparin, which is given into a vein (intravenously) &ndash; This may be the preferred choice in certain circumstances, such as if the patient has severe kidney failure or unstable blood pressure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct oral anticoagulants &ndash; These are available in pill form; they include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto) and apixaban (brand name: Eliquis). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fondaparinux (brand name: Arixtra) &ndash; This is also given by injection.</p><p/><p>Initial anticoagulation is continued for 5 to 10 days. After that, long-term anticoagulation is continued for 3 to 12 months, or sometimes indefinitely (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> below). In most cases, the direct oral anticoagulants are the preferred choice for long-term anticoagulation; these pills include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto), apixaban (brand name: Eliquis), dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa), and edoxaban (brand name: Savaysa). In some situations, another oral medication called warfarin (sample brand name: Coumadin) is given instead. For patients taking warfarin, the clotting factors in the blood need to be measured on a regular basis with a blood test called the International Normalized Ratio (INR). This is not for patients on direct oral anticoagulants (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-coumadin-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Warfarin (Coumadin) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Less commonly, the patient does not take warfarin or any of the direct oral anticoagulants but takes a daily injection of low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux for the entire treatment period. </p><p>The choice of anticoagulant depends upon multiple factors, including the preference of the patient and the healthcare provider, the patient's medical history and other conditions, and cost considerations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with an anticoagulant is recommended for a <strong>MINIMUM</strong> of three months.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a reversible risk factor, such as surgery, the clinician often treats the patient for at least three months or until the risk factor is resolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a first episode of a spontaneous or unprovoked venous thrombosis are treated for a <strong>minimum</strong> of three months. After three months and on a regular basis thereafter, the patient should meet with their healthcare provider to discuss the risks (bleeding) versus the benefits (decreased risk of another clot) of continued treatment. For patients who do NOT have an increased risk of bleeding and can continue anticoagulant monitoring, many experts recommend continuing anticoagulation indefinitely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most experts recommend continuing anticoagulation indefinitely for people with two or more episodes of venous thrombosis or if a permanent risk factor for clotting is present (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome, cancer).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombolytic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some severe cases, a clinician will recommend giving a medicine to dissolve the blood clot(s). This is called thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytic medication can be delivered into the general circulation via a vein in another part of the body, or delivered closer to the clot through a catheter. This therapy is more commonly used in patients who have serious complications related to a large PE or DVT. Serious bleeding is a side effect of thrombolytic therapy, so this treatment is typically only used when a patient's risk of bleeding is low. The best chance of responding to thrombolytic therapy is when there is a short time between the diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">DVT/PE</span> and the start of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689573260\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolectomy is the medical term for removal of PE from the lung. It may be performed using catheters (similar to those used for pulmonary angiography) or with a surgical procedure that is similar to open heart surgery. This procedure may be considered if a person is in serious condition as a result of the PE (eg, persistent low blood pressure due to PE). In this situation, thrombolytic therapy may be attempted first, but if thrombolysis fails or is not an option, embolectomy may be attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Inferior vena cava filter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is a device that blocks the circulation of clots in the venous bloodstream. It is placed in the inferior vena cava (the large vein leading from the lower body to the heart) with a catheter that is inserted into a vein in the groin and threaded through the blood vessels. An IVC filter is often recommended in patients with PE who cannot use anticoagulants because of recent surgery, a stroke caused by bleeding, or significant bleeding in another area of the body. However, IVC filters can be used along with other therapies such as anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or embolectomy when these are appropriate.</p><p>An IVC filter is also recommended in some patients who develop recurrent PE despite anticoagulation. It may also be recommended for patients whose condition makes them susceptible to life-threatening complications if another PE were to occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY EMBOLISM PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain high-risk patients undergoing surgery (especially bone or joint surgery and cancer surgery) may be given anticoagulants to decrease the risk of developing a blood clot. Anticoagulants may also be given to women at high risk for venous thrombosis during and after pregnancy.</p><p>In surgical patients with a moderate to low risk of blood clots, other preventive measures may be used. For example, some surgical patients are fitted with inflatable compression devices that are worn around the legs during and immediately after surgery. The devices periodically fill with air and apply gentle pressure to improve circulation and help prevent clots.</p><p>Graduated compression stockings may also be recommended; these stockings should be custom fitted to apply pressure to the lower legs, with the greatest pressure at the ankle. The pressure should gradually decrease up to the knee. For all patients, walking as soon as possible after surgery can decrease the risk of a blood clot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Extended travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged travel appears to confer a 2- to 4-fold increase in risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-embolism-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although the risk associated with any given flight is low. There are a few tips that may be of benefit during extended travel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71028 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS WITH PULMONARY EMBOLISM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent PE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have had a pulmonary embolism have an increased risk for developing another PE, although this risk is significantly smaller while on anticoagulation (&quot;blood thinner&quot;) therapy. However, all patients should watch for signs of a new PE, including new chest pain with difficulty breathing, a rapid heart rate, or lightheadedness. Recurrent PE can be life-threatening and requires <strong>immediate attention</strong>. Emergency medical services are available in most areas of the United States by calling 911.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulants (&quot;blood thinners&quot;) can have serious side effects and should be taken <strong>exactly</strong> as directed. If a dose is forgotten, the patient should call their provider or clinic for advice. The dose should not be changed to make up for missed doses. Patients should immediately report to the pharmacist or physician if the pill or tablet looks different than the previous bottle.</p><p>Other precautions are necessary when taking Coumadin, which are outlined in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-coumadin-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Warfarin (Coumadin) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients may bleed easily while taking anticoagulants. Bleeding may develop in many areas, such as the nose or gums, excessive menstrual bleeding, bleeding in the urine or feces, bleeding or excessive bruising in the skin, as well as vomiting material that is bright red or like coffee grounds. Bleeding in the brain can cause headaches, vomiting, confusion, weakness, or other stroke-like symptoms. In some cases, bleeding can develop inside the body and not be noticed immediately. Bleeding inside the body can cause a person to feel faint, or have pain in the back or abdomen. A healthcare provider should be notified immediately if there are any signs of this problem.</p><p>Patients should inform their doctor or dentist if they are taking a blood thinner, especially if an invasive procedure is being considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Wear an alert tag</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who take anticoagulants should wear a bracelet, necklace, or similar alert tag at all times. If medical treatment is required and the person is too ill to explain their condition, the tag will alert responders about the patient's use of anticoagulants and the risk of excessive bleeding.</p><p>The alert tag should list the person's medical conditions, as well as the name and phone number of an emergency contact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduce the risk of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some simple modifications can limit the risk of bleeding at home:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a soft bristle toothbrush</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shave with an electric razor rather than a blade</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take care when using scissors or knives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid potentially harmful activities (eg, contact sports, skiing)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not take aspirin or other NSAIDS (eg, ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, Nuprin) while taking warfarin.
