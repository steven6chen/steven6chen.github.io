It is characterized by specific symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue, and signs, such as fluid retention. There are many ways to assess cardiac function. However, there is no diagnostic test for HF, since it is largely a clinical diagnosis that is based upon a careful history and physical examination.

The peak VO<sub>2</sub> is a helpful predictor of prognosis, but functional class and exercise capacity, the magnitude of the reduction in ejection fraction (EF) with systolic dysfunction, serum brain natriuretic peptide concentrations, and a variety of other factors are also important.

The discussion here will focus primarily on myocardial causes of HF. There are two basic pathophysiologic myocardial mechanisms that cause reduced cardiac output and HF: systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction each may be due to a variety of etiologies. Effective management is often dependent upon establishing the correct etiologic diagnosis. As an example, coronary revascularization may be beneficial in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who have evidence of hibernating myocardium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Detection of coronary artery disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The challenge of finding the correct etiology in patients with HF is illustrated by studies that have compared the clinical (pre-transplant) diagnosis and morphologic diagnosis (based upon pathologic examination of the explanted heart) in heart transplant recipients. In two series, each spanning two decades, 17 and 13 percent of patients were misdiagnosed prior to transplantation, particularly patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (30 and 22 percent with clinical misdiagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Conditions that were missed clinically included cardiac sarcoidosis, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (in both series), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and noncompaction (in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HF with reduced EF ([HFrEF] left ventricular EF &le;40 percent) is also known as systolic HF or HF due to systolic dysfunction. Most randomized controlled trials for HF have enrolled patients with HFrEF, and therapy with established efficacy is available for HFrEF but not HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The most common causes of systolic dysfunction are coronary (ischemic) heart disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertension, and valvular disease. Effective therapy of hypertension has led to a changing pattern in which coronary disease has become more prevalent as a cause of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

The most common causes are hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, many patients with symptoms suggestive of HF (shortness of breath, ankle edema, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) who have intact left ventricular systolic function may not have diastolic dysfunction, but have other etiologies that can account for their symptoms, including obesity, lung disease, or occult coronary ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].
