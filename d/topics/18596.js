Although epidemiologic data are lacking, their incidence has been estimated at 1 in 2000 to 5000 births. There is no sex predilection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. More than 90 percent of VMs occur sporadically and consist of unifocal lesions. Multifocal lesions are seen in patients with the rare inherited forms that exhibit autosomal dominant transmission, such as cutaneomucosal venous malformation and glomuvenous malformation (1 and 5 percent of all VMs, respectively), and also in two exceedingly rare sporadic forms, multifocal venous malformation and blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (Bean syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1176539017\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2, located on endothelial cells (ECs), and its ligand angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1), secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells (or pericytes), play a major role in the maturation and stability of veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Knockout of TIE2 or ANG-1 in mice results in impaired blood vessel branching and deficient pericyte coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The other ligand, angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), which is produced by the ECs, seems to be a context-dependent inhibitor of ANG-1 effects, demonstrating tight control of this signaling pathway in endothelial-smooth muscle cell cross-talk. </p><p>Binding of ANG-1 to TIE2 activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, an important pathway implicated in multiple cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, metabolism, and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. mTOR exists as two complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Activated PI3K phosphorylates AKT on threonine 308, leading to partial activation of AKT. Full activation of AKT requires a second phosphorylation that is induced by mTORC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. AKT is thereby able to regulate positively the transcription factor STAT-1 and negatively the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). The latter results in decreased levels of pericyte attractant platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-beta). Cell confluence influences PDGF-beta production, in that AKT activity is elevated in sparse ECs and diminishes with confluence, inversely correlating with PDGF-beta production. This implies that normal ECs, when in cell-cell contact upon tube formation, secrete PDGF-beta in order to recruit pericytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3569205736\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differing activating mutations in the <em>TEK</em> gene on chromosome 9p, encoding TIE2, can cause all four subtypes of VMs: cutaneomucosal venous malformation (VMCM), common (sporadic) VM, multifocal venous malformation (MVM), and blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In VMCM, R849W is the most commonly observed germline <em>TEK</em> mutation. It causes only weak TIE2 hyperphosphorylation and needs a somatic second hit for lesion formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/14,15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,17,18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In sporadic VMs, somatic L914F is identified in 60 percent of TIE2 mutation-positive lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The L914F mutation has not been identified in the germline, suggesting that it may be incompatible with life when present in all cells. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In MVM and BRBN, lesions most often contain double somatic mutations in TIE2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In MVM, the most common combination is Y897C-R915C, whereas in BRBN it is T1105N-T1106P. In MVM, the patient is mosaic for the R915C change, on top of which the Y897C change can be seen in the lesion. In BRBN, the two mutations seem to have occurred at the same time in a &quot;niche,&quot; as both are found with equal frequency in various lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p>The TIE2 mutations result in a sustained and ligand-independent activation of the TIE2 receptor and subsequent sustained hyperphosphorylation of AKT, even in confluent cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The AKT-mediated inhibition of FOXO1 leads to inappropriately low PDGF-beta levels and defective and sparse pericyte coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Mutations in the <em>PIK3CA</em> gene, encoding the p110a catalytic subunit of PI3K, cause approximately 20 percent of common VMs and, similar to TIE2 mutations, result in excessive activation of AKT, low levels of PDGF-beta, and disrupted pericyte coverage surrounding ECs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Three &quot;hotspot&quot; mutations, E542K and E545K in the helical domain (exon 9) and H1047R in the kinase domain (exon 20), are frequently identified. The exact same mutations are frequently seen in human cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast with TIE2-mutated VMs, <em>PIK3CA</em>-mutated VMs do not tend to extend to the skin surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Glomuvenous malformations (GVMs, MIM #138000) are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and caused by loss-of-function mutations in the glomulin gene <em>GLMN </em>on chromosome 1p21-22. These mutations lead to disruption of pericyte differentiation and accumulation of rounded &quot;glomus&quot; cells in lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Several somatic second hits have been identified in GVMs, the most common of which is acquired uniparental isodisomy, which leads to duplication of the inherited mutant allele and loss of the wild-type allele in affected tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Nodular VMs presenting as a group of small, bell-shaped VMs, especially on the face, may be associated with cerebral cavernous malformations of the brain, caused by germline mutations in the cerebral cavernous malformation 1 (<em>CCM1</em>) gene, also called <em>KRIT1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].

Glomuvenous malformations are characterized by the presence of undifferentiated pericytes (glomus cells) surrounding convoluted venous channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1523825068\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized intravascular coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The slow flow of blood through the dilated and ectatic vessels results in blood stagnation, activation of the coagulation cascade, thrombus formation, and thrombolysis. This coagulation disorder, called localized intravascular coagulopathy (LIC), occurs in approximately 42 percent of patients with VMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. Its severity depends upon the size and extension of VMs and is reflected by elevated D-dimer levels (&gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span>. D-dimer levels are markedly elevated (&gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> in 25 percent of patients with VMs, in the absence of other conditions associated with D-dimer increase, such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, or thrombophilia. LIC is considered severe when high D-dimer levels (&gt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> are associated with low fibrinogen levels (&lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Severe LIC may progress to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, with marked consumption of platelets, coagulation factors, and fibrinogen, and risk of severe bleeding during surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/33,34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,36</a>].

Approximately 40 percent of VMs occur on the extremities, 20 percent on the trunk, and 40 percent on the cervicofacial area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The vast majority are unifocal; only 1 percent are multifocal, with multiple cutaneous and visceral lesions. </p><p>VMs typically manifest as a light to dark blue skin discoloration overlying a soft, compressible, subcutaneous mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105862\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105862 \">picture 1</a>). However, the clinical presentation may be highly variable, depending upon the size, location, and mass effect of the lesion on the adjacent organs. Cervicofacial VMs may lead to physical distortion, facial asymmetry, exophthalmus, or dental disorganization. </p><p>VMs are usually present at birth, grow with the child, and slowly expand over time. Hormonal changes and puberty can exacerbate the growth. Some VMs, particularly those with predominant intramuscular localization, may become evident only later in life.</p><p>Symptoms are usually absent at birth but appear during childhood and become more severe as the child grows, depending upon the size and location of the malformation, and may be disabling. Pain is a frequent complaint and is attributed to joint, tendon, or muscle involvement. Pain may worsen at puberty and during intense physical efforts or menstrual periods. It can be more severe in the morning at awakening, presumably due to stasis and swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Migraine is frequently associated with VMs located in the temporal muscle. Involvement of the oral cavity, including the tongue, causes difficulty in speech and mastication. VMs located in the extremities often cause muscle weakness, limb length discrepancy, and hypoplasia of the affected side. </p><p>Some VMs can be life-threatening, due to extension to vital structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Deep oropharyngeal VMs compress and deviate the upper airways, causing snoring and sleep apnea. VMs invading the gastrointestinal or urogenital tract frequently cause bleeding and chronic anemia. Lesions involving bones predispose to pathologic fractures. </p><p>Thrombosis due to stagnant blood flow is common in VMs. It presents with rapid distension, firmness, and pain in the affected areas. However, VMs are unlikely to cause pulmonary embolism because the thrombosed channels are sequestered from the main conducting channels. Persistent thrombi can calcify, resulting in the formation of rounded, hyaline, organized thrombi (phleboliths) that may be palpable or visible on imaging. </p><p>In patients with large VMs, increased D-dimer blood levels, low fibrinogen, and low platelet counts are markers of intravascular coagulopathy.

Sometimes, flow may be observed when performing the Valsalva maneuver or compression. Generally, VMs appear as hypoechoic or heterogeneous and compressible. The detection of phleboliths further supports the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/39,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,44</a>].</p><p>MRI with contrast enhancement is the gold standard for assessing the VM extension and infiltration into adjacent organs and structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113697\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113697 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113698\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113698 \">picture 7</a>). Gadolinium contrast allows a diffuse enhancement of venous channels (not observed in lymphatic malformations). Recommended sequences are T1- (pre- and post-contrast) and T2-weighted images with fat saturation. Typically, images may have intermediate signal intensity on T1 and hyperintense signal on T2 in relation to the content or the presence of hemorrhage or thrombosis. With T2-weighted images, phleboliths appear as focal areas of hypointense signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>Lesions can be graded using MRI imaging based upon the size and margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Well-defined; &le;5 cm in diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2A &ndash; Well-defined; &gt;5 cm in diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2B &ndash; Ill-defined; &le;5 cm in diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 &ndash; Ill-defined; &gt;5 cm in diameter</p><p/><p>This grading system has a prognostic significance and may predict the response to sclerotherapy.

When D-dimer levels are elevated in a patient with a VM without any concurrent disease that may induce a D-dimer increase, the likelihood that a venous component is present is approximately 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-malformations/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. This is true for pure, isolated VMs (unifocal or multifocal), as well as for mixed and syndromic lesions (capillary-venous malformation and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome).
