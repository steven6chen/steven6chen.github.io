(Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart out to the body.) Atherosclerosis is the reason most people have a heart attack or a stroke.</p><p>Atherosclerosis can affect arteries all over the body. There are different names for atherosclerosis depending on which arteries it affects.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carotid artery disease</strong> is a form of atherosclerosis that affects the carotid arteries, which bring blood to the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72617 \">figure 1</a>). This form of atherosclerosis can lead to stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coronary heart disease</strong>, also called coronary artery disease, is a form of atherosclerosis that affects the coronary arteries, which bring blood to the heart muscle. This form of atherosclerosis can cause chest pain and lead to heart attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60394 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal artery stenosis</strong> is a form of atherosclerosis that affects the renal arteries, which bring blood to the kidneys. This form of atherosclerosis can cause high blood pressure or lead to kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral artery disease</strong> is a form of atherosclerosis that affects the arteries that bring blood to the arms and legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60105\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60105 \">figure 3</a>). People with this condition sometimes have pain, tingling, or numbness in their legs when they walk.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090577\"><span class=\"h1\">How does atherosclerosis cause heart attacks, strokes, and other problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atherosclerosis-related plaques can cause problems in 2 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaques can get too big and reduce blood flow to certain body parts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83222 \">figure 4</a>). This can cause symptoms (such as pain) in the part of the body that is not getting enough blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaques can break open, or rupture. When that happens, blood clots form inside the artery and block the blood supply to tissues past the clot. This is what happens during a stroke or a heart attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60394 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090592\"><span class=\"h1\">Who is at risk for atherosclerosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person has a higher chance of getting atherosclerosis if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a high cholesterol or triglycerides (triglycerides are a type of fat found in blood)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has high blood pressure </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has diabetes </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smokes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has an unhealthy diet </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is overweight or does very little physical activity </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a mother or father who got atherosclerosis before the age of 50 years </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090607\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Aside from a physical exam, doctors do not typically order tests to check for atherosclerosis in general. Instead, they order tests if they think a patient might have a specific form of atherosclerosis, such as coronary heart disease or peripheral artery disease. The tests for each of these conditions are all very different.</p><p>A general test that is often done in people who might have atherosclerosis is called a &quot;lipid profile.&quot; This is a blood test that measures the amounts of different forms of fat and cholesterol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090622\"><span class=\"h1\">Can the problems caused by atherosclerosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To reduce your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or related problem, do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the medicines your doctor prescribes to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and to prevent clots.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight (if you are overweight).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products. Don't eat a lot of meats, sweets, or refined grains.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do something active for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quit smoking (if you smoke). Ask your doctor for help.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Have no more than 2 drinks a day if you are a man. Have no more than 1 drink a day if you are a woman.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090652\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carotid artery disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=renovascular-hypertension-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Renovascular hypertension (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-artery-disease-and-claudication-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peripheral artery disease and claudication (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doppler-ultrasound-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Doppler ultrasound (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ischemic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-artery-disease-and-claudication-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peripheral artery disease and claudication (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=children-and-heart-disease-atherosclerosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Children and heart disease (atherosclerosis) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
