They are found in at least 40 percent of bacterial pneumonias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The usual parapneumonic effusion is small and resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, if bacteria invade the pleural space, a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema may result, which will require antibiotic therapy plus additional interventions. Infected pleural effusions can also rarely develop without the presence of an adjacent pneumonia. </p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of parapneumonic effusions and empyema are reviewed here. The evaluation and management of parapneumonic effusions and empyema in infants and children are discussed separately.

The pleural fluid is characterized by &quot;exudative&quot; chemistries and an influx of neutrophils into the pleural space. An effusion forms when the resorptive capacity of the pleural space is exceeded; it resolves with resolution of the pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-pleural-liquid-turnover-in-the-normal-state\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of pleural liquid turnover in the normal state&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-pleural-liquid-accumulation-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of pleural liquid accumulation in disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, pleural effusions are common and are usually sterile.

Bacterial invasion typically leads to an increased number of neutrophils and the development of pleural fluid acidosis, which results from anaerobic utilization of glucose by the neutrophils and bacteria. In addition, lysis of neutrophils increases the lactate dehydrogenase concentration in the pleural fluid to values often in excess of 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span>. Perhaps, because the bacterial count is low or because anaerobic cultures are not done, cultures of fluid from complicated parapneumonic effusions are sometimes falsely negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, the typical morphotypes of anaerobes are usually seen on Gram stain and the characteristic putrid odor of the pleural fluid is considered diagnostic of anaerobic infection. Often, there is deposition of a dense layer of fibrin on both the visceral and parietal pleurae that can lead to pleural loculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Whether spontaneous adhesions of the pleural space can result from pleural space inflammation without infection is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracic empyema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Empyema develops when there is evident bacterial infection of the pleural liquid, resulting in either pus or the presence of bacterial organisms on Gram stain. A positive culture is not required for diagnosis, since there are several reasons why bacteria may not be cultured from an empyema (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bacteriology'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaerobic organisms may be difficult to culture or anaerobic cultures are not done because they are not specifically requested</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sampling is often performed after a patient has received antibiotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile inflammatory fluid may be aspirated adjacent to an infected loculus of infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current culture methods are insufficiently sensitive</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of the adult with parapneumonic effusion or empyema depends upon the patient's timing of presentation and immune competence, and also the specific organisms causing infection. Patients with pneumonia and uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion present earlier in the course of their pneumonia; those with empyema typically present later when bacteria from the untreated pneumonia have had time to colonize the pleural space. Infection with less virulent bacteria favors a later presentation; therefore, many empyemas complicate indolent anaerobic pneumonias, such as those following aspiration. Prior use of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma decreases the incidence of parapneumonic effusions, a surprising outcome given the increased incidence of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in these patients. One speculation is that the use of inhaled corticosteroids leads to better outcome and fewer complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Common clinical features of bacterial pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion include cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and sputum production. However, patients may only have one or two of these symptoms. In general, the presenting symptoms, other than pleuritic pain and duration of fever, are not helpful in determining which patients have pneumonia versus pneumonia with a parapneumonic effusion or empyema. Compared to those with pneumonia alone, patients with empyema may report a longer course with several days of fever and malaise rather than hours. Among patients with pneumonia, the presence of a parapneumonic effusion was associated with an increased likelihood of being admitted, a longer hospital stay, and possibly increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Physical examination may identify the presence of pleural fluid when the fine or coarse crackles, egophony (also known as e-to-a changes), and increased fremitus (palpable asymmetric increase in vibration with speech) typical of consolidation are replaced by decreased breath sounds and decreased fremitus. Occasionally, egophony will still be present at the upper edge of the effusion. Dullness to percussion is a potential feature of lung consolidation from either pneumonia or pleural effusion and is thus not a useful discriminating physical finding. Although clinical findings are helpful when present, they are often absent so radiographic imaging is crucial to the complete evaluation.</p><p>A scoring system has been developed and validated to determine which patients with parapneumonic effusions or empyema are at highest risk for poor outcome. The RAPID score uses higher age, higher blood urea nitrogen, lower albumin, hospital-acquired infection, and lack of purulence to add points to a score that subsequently defines worse short and long term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic and ultrasound imaging play a key role in the evaluation and management of parapneumonic effusions and empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In all patients with pneumonia, the chest radiograph should be evaluated for evidence of pleural fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema is first suggested by a chest radiograph showing a pleural-based opacity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73968\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73968 \">image 1</a>). When this feature is noted, we usually proceed to additional imaging with ultrasonography. In the past, lateral decubitus radiographs were often performed to determine the extent to which an effusion is freely flowing within the pleural space. As the availability of ultrasonography advances, this test is rarely performed. </p><p>Ultrasonography permits easy identification of free or loculated pleural effusions, and it facilitates differentiation of loculated effusions from solid masses. It is also helpful to guide site choice for thoracentesis. One retrospective analysis of 66 patients suggested that ultrasonography was more sensitive than chest radiography (69 versus 61 percent) but less sensitive than computed tomography (69 versus 76 percent) for the diagnosis of a complicated parapneumonic effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p>In adults, optimal evaluation of an empyema or loculated effusion requires a chest computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast. Radiographic contrast enhances visualization of the pleural surfaces and assists in delineating pleural fluid loculi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80445\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80445 \">image 2</a>). Thickening of the visceral and parietal pleura is suggestive of empyema when associated with significant (usually &gt;30 mm) separation of the pleural surfaces (split pleura sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Small air bubbles which may have entered via prior thoracentesis may be noted within the fluid collection, called &quot;pleural microbubbles.&quot; The presence of pleural microbubbles may suggest that the fluid collection will be more resistant to chest tube drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, airway or parenchymal abnormalities may be detected, such as endobronchial lesions or lung abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

Samples of fluid should be sent for a cell count with differential and chemistries (eg, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose); pH should be determined with a blood gas analyzer. If a blood gas analyzer is not available, measurement of the glucose concentration of the fluid should be substituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-a-pleural-effusion-in-adults-initial-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of a pleural effusion in adults: Initial testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, a pH &lt;7.20 or a glucose &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is an indication for drainage of the effusion because such effusions are unlikely to resolve spontaneously (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below). However, these thresholds are not well validated clinically and therefore should not be utilized rigidly. A meta-analysis of pleural fluid chemistries in parapneumonic effusions suggested that the pleural fluid pH is the most useful test in deciding which effusions to drain, although more primary studies were needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A pleural pH between 7.21 and 7.29 appeared to represent the threshold for consideration of drainage of a complicated parapneumonic effusion. Guideline societies suggest drainage for pH &lt;7.20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>].</p><p>It should be appreciated, however, that other diseases are associated with pleural fluid acidosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low glucose, including malignancy, tuberculosis, rheumatoid pleurisy, and lupus pleuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Appropriate studies to exclude these conditions should be performed when clinically indicated. In addition, the correct measurement of pleural fluid pH is dependent on proper technique. Exposure of the fluid to air, delay in measurement and use of pH meters instead of a blood gas machine lead to inaccurate measurements, a problem which appears to be common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Novel biomarkers of infection (eg, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, STREM-1) have been evaluated for possible utility in distinguishing empyemas from uncomplicated pleural effusions, but were found to be no more useful than the more traditional pleural chemistries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Serum procalcitonin levels &gt;0.18 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> have been associated with a sensitivity of 83 percent and specificity of 81 percent for the effusion having a bacterial infectious etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], but there is no study to date that shows this biomarker has good sensitivity for the need for drainage. Another retrospective study showed that higher levels of pleural vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were associated with complicated parapneumonic effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Further prospective studies of serum or pleural biomarkers that define a population requiring pleural fluid drainage are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">BACTERIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most organisms thought to be responsible for a parapneumonic effusion or empyema are the same as those causing the pneumonia. However, some organisms, particularly anaerobic species, may be difficult to isolate by culture of fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Inoculation of pleural fluid into blood culture bottles in addition to the usual sterile containers used for standard Gram stain and culture may improve the microbiologic yield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. With Gram stain, Peptococci and Peptostreptococci appear on Gram stain like aerobic strep as Gram positive cocci in pairs or chains, but the anaerobic Gram negative bacilli are morphologically unique. <em>Fusobacterium nucleatum</em> is a filamentous (spindle shaped) Gram negative bacteria and <em>B. melaninogenicus</em> bacteria are small, delicate Gram negative bacteria. Most microbiologists will interpret these correctly. In a series of 53 patients with suspected pleural infection and culture data from both standard and blood culture bottles obtained at the same time, the number of patients with identifiable pathogens increased by 21 percent (95 % CI 8.9 to 20.8%). Therefore, we culture pleural fluid using blood culture bottles (aerobic and anaerobic) in addition to sterile containers.</p><p>A putrid odor of empyema fluid is considered diagnostic of anaerobic infection; the Gram stain will also help identify anaerobes because of the unique morphology of some anaerobic Gram-negative rods as noted above. Blood and pleural culture results may be helpful, but are often negative. Anaerobic empyema with aspiration pneumonia often is seen in the aspiration-prone patient who presents relatively late in the infection with pneumonitis involving the superior segment of a lower lobe or posterior segment or an upper lobe.</p><p>Anaerobic bacteria have been cultured in 36 to 76 percent of human empyemas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The predominant organisms isolated from anaerobic empyemas are <em>Fusobacterium nucleatum</em>, Prevotella sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus. B. fragilis is relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,32</a>]. The high incidence of anaerobic infection in empyema may reflect its common association with aspiration pneumonia and possibly from the anaerobic environment of the pleural space, which can be walled off from the aerobic lung, and the indolent nature of these pneumonias, which permits pleural penetration of bacteria before antibiotics are instituted. Note that culture results for anaerobes are usually delayed due to the slow growth and tedious processes for identification. </p><p>Animal models suggest that infection with a mixed bacterial flora containing aerobes and anaerobes is more likely to produce an empyema than infection with a single organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Finding an aerobic organism on bacterial culture does not exclude the need for prompt coverage of uncultured anaerobic organisms. This was demonstrated in a study of 197 empyemas that found mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection in 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Particularly common is the combination of anaerobes with microaerophilic or aerobic streptococci, all components of the normal oral flora.</p><p>Some centers have begun routine molecular analysis of parapneumonic effusions to detect <em>S. pneumoniae </em>infection by rapid antigen detection assays or broad-range 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction. These centers report a much higher detection rate for S. pneumoniae than historical case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Other bacteria that are prevalent in empyema include <em>Streptococcus milleri</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and Enterobacteriaceae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].

Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) often causes a necrotizing pneumonia that is complicated by pleural infection. Streptococcus group A pneumonia is also associated with a high rate of empyema. In patients with influenza, the major causes of bacterial superinfection and empyema have been <em>S. aureus</em>, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Tuberculous empyema is a rare disease in which tuberculous infection leads to pus in the pleural space in which the predominant pleural cell is the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN).

Virtually all antibiotics studied adequately penetrate the pleural space. The single exception is that aminoglycosides may be inactivated at low pleural fluid pH and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Anaerobic organisms are common, particularly among patients who present with empyema, and are difficult to culture. Nevertheless, these pathogens should be suspected based upon clinical and microbiologic clues including pulmonary infection in a setting of pneumonia in association of likely aspiration, putrid pleural fluid, or Gram stain showing the characteristic mixed flora. Other major pathogens implicated in empyema include <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and gram-negative bacilli including Klebsiella pneumoniae that are easily recovered with routine culture of pleural fluid. Importantly cultures of anaerobic organisms sometimes require a specific request and recovery and identification of these organisms is tedious and time-consuming so these results are usually not available for several days. In addition, most labs do not do in vitro sensitivity testing on anaerobes. Therefore, antibiotics to treat anaerobic organisms are usually selected empirically based upon clinical and microbiology findings. Options for empiric therapy that would cover the anaerobic organisms include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, beta-lactam plus beta-lactamase inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>), and carbapenems (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73450 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>The choice of antibiotic regimen is optimally determined by knowledge of suspected or proven aerobes, while covering suspected anaerobes if clinical features suggest their role. As an example, if Gram negative aerobic organisms are suspected in Gram stain or culture of pleural fluid, sputum, bronchoscopic specimens or blood, then a second- or third-generation cephalosporin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or parenteral aminopenicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/sulbactam</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>) or a carbapenem would be optimal pending sensitivity test results for pathogenic aerobic Gram negative bacteria. Inclusion of agents that cover organisms such as methicillin resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em> aeruginosa should be considered in patents with hospital-acquired or post-procedural empyema. There are many antibiotic choices that cover Gram positive aerobic infections. When a concomitant anaerobe needs to be covered, a beta lactam-beta lactamase antibiotic is usually chosen unless the suspected organism is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. In this situation, two antibiotics that cover Staphylococcus and anaerobes independently are warranted for empiric therapy until cultures return. Single agent therapy with either penicillin or metronidazole is not considered optimal.

The decision about which parapneumonic effusions need drainage depends on the particular type or stage of parapneumonic effusion. Empyemas may need additional intervention beyond single tube thoracostomy (also known as chest tube drainage), including placement of additional drainage tubes under computed tomography (CT) guidance, thoracoscopy with lysis of adhesions, and decortication. Patients with persistent air leaks often require surgical or endoscopic repair procedures.

Although some patients with a complicated parapneumonic effusion can be managed solely with antibiotics, we believe that early pleural fluid drainage of all loculi of fluid via tube thoracostomy speeds clinical recovery and hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This hypothesis remains to be validated in prospective clinical trials.

It is generally preferred over more invasive options for patients with uniloculated effusions and free-flowing fluid, but is also frequently used to drain multiloculated empyemas. The technique of tube thoracostomy is discussed separately.

When multiple loculations are present, we typically place small-bore catheters to allow the placement of multiple tubes as needed.</p><p>When the empyema is uniloculated, the choice of thoracostomy tube size is more controversial. Traditionally, a larger bore tube was preferred for drainage of more viscous empyema fluid, and smaller bore tubes were reserved for less viscous fluid. However, in a prospective, nonrandomized study of 454 patients who underwent chest tube drainage for empyema as part of the Multi-center Intrapleural Streptokinase Trial (MIST1), no significant difference was found in mortality or need for thoracic surgery between large (15-20F), medium (10-14F), or small (&lt;10F) tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/36,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,49</a>].

There was no difference in mortality, need for surgery, radiographic outcome, or length of hospitalization. A major weakness of the trial was that thrombolytics were used late in the clinical course, with a median time from first symptom to randomization of approximately two weeks. Other concerns include use of small-bore chest tubes and reliance on plain chest radiographs, rather than ultrasound or computed tomography, in the clinical characterization of the fluid collections.</p><p>A Cochrane review that included the above study (n=761) failed to show a reduction in death among patients who received fibrinolytic therapy (28 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. When surgical intervention was included as a form of treatment failure, fibrinolytics reduced the risk of this specific outcome (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85).

Tubes were clamped for 1 hour after each intrapleural administration. Combination TPA-DNase therapy resulted in a greater decrease in radiographic pleural opacity, a lower rate of surgical referral (odds ratio 0.17; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.87), and a shorter hospital stay (-6.7 days; 95% CI, -12.0 to -1.9) compared with placebo. Neither of the individual agents performed better than placebo, although the numbers were small. Two episodes of pleural hemorrhage and one episode of hemoptysis were seen with combined TPA-DNase therapy, although the side effect incidence was not different across study groups.

The following subsets are recognized. An uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion has &quot;exudative&quot; chemistries, normal pH and glucose, and negative cultures. A complicated parapneumonic effusion typically has &quot;exudative&quot; chemistries, a low pleural pH (pH &lt;7.20), a low glucose, and is often loculated. Empyema fluid typically looks like pus, shows polymorph neutrophils, and organisms are visible on Gram stain, although cultures may be negative due primarily to failure to recover anaerobes or, less commonly, to antecedent antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, all parapneumonic effusions, EXCEPT those that are free flowing and layer less than 10 mm on a lateral decubitus film, should be sampled by thoracentesis. If a small bore catheter is used for thoracentesis, all free-flowing pleural fluid should be drained, if possible, prior to catheter removal. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pleural fluid analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a parapneumonic effusion or an empyema, an empiric, broad spectrum antibiotic that includes coverage for anaerobic organisms should be initiated promptly, because empyemas often harbor multiple species of bacteria, particularly anaerobes. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with an uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion, one that is small to moderate in size, free flowing, and has a pH of 7.20 or greater (eg, category 2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59099 \">table 1</a>), we recommend observation rather than placement of a chest tube for drainage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a large, loculated, or complicated parapneumonic effusion (eg, category 3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59099 \">table 1</a>), we recommend prompt drainage of any remaining pleural fluid rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For further drainage of the pleural space, we suggest tube thoracostomy rather than a more invasive procedure (eg, thoracoscopy, decortication) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound-guided placement of multiple tubes may be needed when pleural loculations prevent adequate drainage by a single tube. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with debridement may be preferred in patients with multiple loculations and a thick pleural peel. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Complicated parapneumonic effusions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Empyema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When tube thoracostomy is used for initial drainage of an empyema, a chest CT scan should be obtained within 24 hours after chest tube placement to document appropriate placement of the tube and assess drainage. For patients with ongoing signs of infection (fever, leukocytosis, anorexia) or those who do not have good drainage of empyema fluid from a well-placed chest tube, we suggest intrapleural administration of a combination of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) 10 mg and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) 5 mg, twice daily for three days rather than no intrapleural therapy or either agent alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Fibrinolytic agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H824539\" class=\"local\">'Fibrinolytic plus mucolytic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continued signs of infection together with failure of adequate pleural drainage should prompt thoracoscopy or thoracotomy to lyse adhesions, fully drain the pleural space, and optimize chest tube placement. The choice between thoracoscopic debridement and decortication depends on several factors; those favoring decortication include more adhesions, greater visceral pleural thickness, and larger empyema cavity size. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Decortication'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Light RW, Girard WM, Jenkinson SG, George RB.
