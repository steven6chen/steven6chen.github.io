However, the mechanism through which exercise may improve symptoms is not clear. Tissue injury causes complex changes within the peripheral and central nervous system that amplifies the processing of pain from the injured body area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The persistence of these neurologic changes are largely responsible for the perpetuation of symptoms.</p><p>Animal studies have suggested that exercise may reverse some of the injury-induced neurologic changes associated with pain. These neurologic changes enhance synaptic efficiency between pain neurons and &ldquo;sensitize&rdquo; the pain system. Randomized controlled trials of experimentally-injured animals have demonstrated that exercise reverses many of the injury-induced changes through reversal of injury-induced cell proliferation and neurotrophic factors in the sensory ganglia, spinal cord, and brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/5-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-15</a>]. These changes are associated with improvement of all behavioral markers of pain in the exercising animal. It has also been observed that the benefits of exercise are somewhat generalized and may be induced with a variety of different exercise methods, even exercise that excludes the injured body part [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Projecting these animal studies to humans would suggest that the effects of exercise include favorable changes in pain in the relevant neurologic processes within the peripheral and central nervous system that strongly contribute to the production, maintenance, and resolution of LBP. Additionally, human studies have found that elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress often accompany LBP, and exercise attenuates these inflammatory processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2091276554\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exacerbations of low back pain (LBP) can occur during or after therapeutic exercise. Increased LBP following exercise often is benign and simply indicates that the pain-producing tissues have been stimulated. Additionally, when compared with nonexercising control populations, exercise does not appear to increase the risk of LBP exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>].</p><p>Patients are also at risk for musculoskeletal injuries. Other risks of exercise, including rare serious risks (eg, arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, and myocardial infarction), and the medical evaluation prior to exercise are discussed separately.

In contrast to the limited evidence of benefit from exercise for acute LBP, systematic reviews have concluded that exercise may have modest benefits for pain relief and improved function in patients with subacute (4 to 12 weeks) and chronic LBP (&gt;12 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/20,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3878563369\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No exercise technique has demonstrated superiority over others for patients with subacute and chronic LBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This may be because exercise in all forms has the same generalized effects on the abnormal neurologic and inflammatory processes associated with subacute and chronic LBP. (See <a href=\"#H2555196158\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for exercise'</a> above.)</p><p>We encourage patients who are already active and exercising to continue to do so. Patients with chronic LBP who regularly participate in moderate-to-vigorous leisure time activities have less pain and better function compared with those that are less physically active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For other patients who are not active, we discuss the options available within the patient's community along with the patient's preferences, circumstances, fitness level, and exercise experiences to determine what might be best for the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. We often refer patients to physical therapy for formal exercise instruction and education.</p><p>In order of increasing complexity, some of the more popular exercise approaches for LBP and the evidence of effectiveness are summarized below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2831009670\"><span class=\"h3\">Walking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Walking is the simplest and most readily available form of exercise for chronic LBP. Evidence suggests that walking may be effective to decrease symptoms of chronic musculoskeletal pain, including LBP. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 studies of walking (five studies in patients with chronic LBP, other studies included patients with knee osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia) to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain concluded that walking improved pain and function for up to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Benefits after 12 months were uncertain. Most included studies compared walking with education; however, some studies compared walking with strengthening exercises or home exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3985328280\"><span class=\"h3\">Aerobic exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aerobic exercise may be effective to decrease symptoms of LBP. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of eight cohort studies evaluating a variety of aerobic exercises (such as bicycling, swimming, treadmill walking, and elliptical trainers), found that aerobic exercise decreased pain intensity and improved the physical functioning over time in patients with chronic LBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1091668566\"><span class=\"h3\">Community-based programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can be encouraged to participate in available community-based exercise programs. One observational study including 118 patients showed short- and long-term improvements in chronic LBP and function in patients who joined such a program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Compared with baseline, pain scores had improved by 48 percent while disability scores improved by 60 percent at one year follow-up. The program consisted of 10 weeks of group classes incorporating a strong educational component combined with physical retraining with option to enroll in advanced classes after 10 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2550714915\"><span class=\"h3\">Pilates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pilates is a technique of exercise that focuses on performing controlled movements of the whole body that start with the center or core (back and abdomen) and flow outward towards the limbs. Proponents report useful health benefits including body alignment, breathing, strength, coordination, and balance. This form of exercise can be adapted to wide levels of fitness and there are techniques that have been adapted to treat LBP. Studies suggest that effectiveness of Pilates for LBP may be similar to other exercise regimens. A 2015 systematic review including 29 studies concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that Pilates is more effective than any other exercise for the treatment of chronic LBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial of 22 patients with chronic LBP comparing Pilates with general exercise found no differences between groups with regard to pain and functionality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4085698412\"><span class=\"h3\">Yoga</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yoga refers to spiritual and physical practices that promote controlled breathing, specific stretches, body positions, and meditation with the goal of obtaining improved health and tranquility. A 2017 meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials found that yoga produced small to moderate improvements in function compared to non-exercise controls (low- to moderate-certainty evidence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Yoga also was associated with small improvements in pain; however, the effect did not reach the prespecified threshold for clinically meaningful improvement. Compared with other non-yoga exercises, there was little to no improvement in back-related function (very low-certainty evidence).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H136618731\"><span class=\"h3\">Alexander technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Alexander technique involves individualized, hands-on instruction to improve balance, posture, and coordination, as well as recognition of harmful habits of muscle use in order to avoid painful movements. A randomized trial of 479 patients with chronic or recurrent LBP found 24 sessions of the Alexander technique moderately effective at 12 months, although six sessions were not effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, the combination of six sessions of the Alexander technique with a doctor's prescription for home-based exercise also resulted in moderate benefit in terms of pain relief and reduction in disability and was also more cost-effective compared with usual care or massage therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3024355557\"><span class=\"h3\">Directional preference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directional preference is a method of exercise for treatment of LBP that is based on the theory that movement in directions that immediately increase pain intensity or cause pain to radiate away from the midline should be avoided in favor of movement that lessens pain or &quot;centralizes&quot; pain, causing it to move toward the spinal midline. Exercise is then prescribed based on these observations. These techniques rely on the assessment of a physical therapist and emphasize instruction in self-care. Evidence suggests that directional preference exercise for chronic LBP may be marginally better when compared with advice to stay active but not when compared with other forms of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3460199845\"><span class=\"h3\">Core exercise and spine stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Core exercise and spine stabilization programs are based on the theory that deficits in core muscle function result in suboptimal postures and movements that contribute to back pain. Optimal body movements require stabilizing the body through recruitment of the core muscles of the abdominal wall, low back, pelvis, and diaphragm. Core strength and postures are assessed, and exercises are initiated to correct strength deficits and control core movements to promote a neutral or straight low back during activities. Core exercise is usually taught by a physical therapist. Studies suggest that core exercises may be more beneficial compared with no exercise for LBP but not compared with other exercise types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>].</p><p>Variations of core exercise that attempt to fine tune this approach, such as low load motor control versus high load lifting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], precise motor control of the trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], or greater hip strengthening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], do not appear to improve outcomes compared with alternative exercise approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1302659489\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional restoration/&quot;back boot camp&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional <span class=\"nowrap\">restoration/&quot;back</span> boot camp&quot; refers to an approach to exercise that begins with low resistance strength challenges and progressive increase in resistances with each session. This technique is also known as progressive-resisted or quota-based strengthening. The progression of exercise proceeds even in the setting of pain as long as the pain is tolerable. The intervention focuses on restoring optimum back and life function. It may be used for injured workers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-low-back-pain-treatment#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational low back pain: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Functional restoration or work hardening programs'</a>.)</p><p>The exercise intervention is delivered using a cognitive behavioral approach, which includes education regarding the safety of exercise with pain symptoms; support and praise for successful participation as well as challenge and encouragement to achieve desired functional, recreational, and life goals.</p><p>Impaired function is detected by simple measurement of cardiovascular endurance, trunk and hamstring range of motion, as well as back strength and lifting capacity. Identified impairments are then targeted with stretching, weight training, and aerobic activities. The intensity of exercises is increased from session to session in a stepwise manner (graded exercise). The presence of tolerable pain during and after an exercise session is expected, and expected to decrease as exercise desensitizes the pain-producing processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Treatment is usually delivered in 8 to 12 physical therapy sessions over four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>This approach to exercise offers benefits in terms of pain and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Though flexibility, strength, and endurance may improve with this type of treatment, the degree of back pain improvement shows weak or no correlation with changes in any of these physiological parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/3,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,49</a>]. This suggests that pain improvement results from more generalized benefits of exercise on pain processing rather than specific changes in physiologic parameters. (See <a href=\"#H2555196158\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for exercise'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2087488428\"><span class=\"h3\">Multidisciplinary (interdisciplinary) rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multidisciplinary, or interdisciplinary, rehabilitation combines physical, vocational, and behavioral components provided by multiple healthcare professionals. Intensity and content of interdisciplinary therapy vary widely. These programs combine graded exercise therapy with a psychosocial approach, generally involving a psychologist. Multidisciplinary therapy can be similar to functional restoration programs but emphasize multiple providers and behavioral interventions. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;, section on 'Multidisciplinary (interdisciplinary) rehabilitation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551972349\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education and appropriate counseling regarding expectations is an important aspect of patient care. We educate patients regarding incorrect assumptions about back pain. For example, patients often misinterpret the importance of anatomic abnormalities such as degenerating, bulging, or herniated discs, facet arthritis, and stenosis that were noted on imaging. We educate patients that anatomic abnormalities are not always associated with pain, they can be found in many asymptomatic patients, and pain often resolves over time while anatomic abnormalities may not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H38931125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Limited utility of imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain#H1111894441\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;, section on 'Patient education'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, counseling the patient prior to beginning exercise that they might initially feel worse before they feel better can help to avoid the inevitable concerns induced by an exacerbation of pain. Patients may also believe that certain activities that stress the spine are unsafe, such as bending from the waist, twisting, lifting heavy items, exercise, and sports, especially if they provoke pain. Challenging these beliefs and offering a neurological explanation for provoked pain as an abnormal low pain stimulus threshold, may be helpful. It may also be helpful to address concerns such as &quot;an unstable spine,&quot; &quot;misaligned&quot; vertebrae, hips, sacroiliac joints, or leg length discrepancy, none of which are generally accepted as relevant to symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2091276554\" class=\"local\">'Risk of exercise'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2555196158\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for exercise'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3720139646\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE FOR PREVENTION OF LOW BACK PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise may prevent incident episodes of low back pain (LBP) as well as recurrence of LBP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention of LBP</strong> &ndash; Exercise may prevent episodes of LBP. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis including 23 studies and nearly 31,000 participants who did not have significant LBP at study entry concluded that exercise decreased the risk of LBP (relative risk [RR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.50-0.86) for up to one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The effect was greater when exercise was combined with education (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.74) with the effects lasting longer than one year. A variety of exercise programs were studied. The systematic review noted that the quality of the evidence was low to very low for exercise alone and moderate for exercise and education. Leisure time physical activity also may be effective in preventing LBP. In a 2017 meta-analysis of six prospective cohort studies with 48,520 participants, involvement in sport or other leisure physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of frequent or chronic LBP (RR 0.89, 95% CI (0.82-0.97) in <span class=\"nowrap\">moderately/highly</span> active individuals compared with inactive persons, but it did not affect the risk of LBP for &ge;1 day in the past month or past 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preventing recurrence of LBP</strong> &ndash; Many believe exercise therapy may have a role in secondary prevention, particularly for those predisposed to having recurrent LBP. In a systematic review that included nine observational studies, post-treatment exercises were more effective than no intervention for reducing the rate of LBP recurrence at one year (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
