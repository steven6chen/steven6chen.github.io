It is a common problem in children and constitutes up to 40 percent of pediatric urology clinic visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In some children, bladder dysfunction is associated with constipation referred to as bowel bladder dysfunction, which had been previously called dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES).</p><p>Daytime urinary incontinence, a common feature of bladder dysfunction, can cause major stress in school-age children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], and negatively impact a child's self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, it is desirable to identify and treat affected school-age children as early as possible.</p><p>The evaluation of non-neurologic bladder dysfunction in children will be reviewed here. The etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children are discussed separately.

The history should be tailored to the age of the patient and the appropriate stage in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> development of bladder control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Normal voiding'</a>.)</p><p>The history should seek information about the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voiding schedule &ndash; Voiding schedule includes the frequency of voids and, in toilet-trained children, the frequency of incontinent episodes. If possible, an estimation of the voided volume should also be obtained. Large voids may indicate a large capacity bladder seen in children with underactive bladders or polyuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of bladder dysfunction &ndash; Bladder dysfunctional symptoms include urgency, pain during urination, holding maneuvers, hesitancy, dribbling, straining, and an intermittent or weak urinary stream. The definitions for these symptoms are discussed separately.

A scoring system based upon a scale of 0 to 3 for each question results in an overall score indicative of the severity of bladder dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Incontinence Symptom Index-Pediatric, an 11-item questionnaire that is divided into two domains impairment and symptom severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysfunctional Voiding and Incontinence Symptoms Score that assesses daytime symptoms, nighttime symptoms, voiding habits, bowel habits, and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although these validated survey tools have been shown to correlate with clinician clinical impression, the mean symptom scores from these questionnaires were higher than the clinician rating for symptom severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A comparison found that all three questionnaires were equivalent when evaluating response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The survey tool we use in our institution uses questions from several validated instruments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel habits &ndash; Because constipation is often seen in children with bladder dysfunction, information regarding the child's bowel habits should be obtained. This includes the frequency of bowel movements; the consistency, caliber, and size of stool; presence of pain during defection; and any history of stool withholding behavior, or fecal incontinence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It is also useful to obtain the age that other family members achieved urinary continence to determine whether there is a familial maturational delay in achieving bladder control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perinatal and neonatal history &ndash; Screening for any evidence of any perinatal or neonatal insult should be included. As examples, perinatal anoxia or congenital infection could alter the central and peripheral nervous system normal coordination of bladder function, resulting in bladder dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet intake &ndash; The amount and type of fluid should be determined. Excessive fluid intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluid intake during the night time may be reflective of polyuria due to a concentrating defect, diabetes mellitus, or, less often, primary polydipsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous urinary tract infection &ndash; Urinary tract infection (UTI) with and without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) are often seen in children with bladder dysfunction. The management of VUR is more difficult in children with bladder dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Urinary tract infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Vesicoureteral reflux'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodevelopment delay and psychological disorders &ndash; Children who are developmentally delayed may also be delayed in gaining voluntary bladder control. Although most children with bladder dysfunction do not have behavior problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], there appears to be an increased risk of bladder dysfunction in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Several studies report an estimated prevalence of 20 to 50 percent of psychological disorders including depression, anxiety, and ADHD in children with urinary or fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

Voluntary holding with postponement of voiding may be reflective of a conflict between the parent and child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The level of stress on the parents correlates with the severity of the child's bladder-bowel dysfunction as well as his or her psychosocial difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toilet training history &ndash; The history should include whether toilet training was prolonged, delayed, or stressful, and whether there was a period of dryness after toilet training. As noted above, a stressful or prolonged history of toilet training may be indicative of <span class=\"nowrap\">parental/child</span> conflict. Anatomic causes of incontinency, such as an ectopic ureter, will typically have no period of complete dryness after toilet training.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Voiding diary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of a three-day voiding diary is helpful to obtain an objective record of bowel and urinary voiding patterns. It should include the time and volume of each void, the time of each incontinent episode, fluid intake, the time of each bowel movement, and any episode of fecal soiling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102378\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef102378 \">form 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination is focused on detecting neurologic or urologic abnormalities and includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower back &ndash; The back is examined for cutaneous signs of occult spinal dysraphism or sacral agenesis, such as a presacral dimple, hair patch, lipoma, or asymmetric gluteal cleft.

Any abnormality of the neurologic examination may be indicative of a neurologic lesion that also affects the function of the bladder, which is coordinated by an integrated neural network involving both the peripheral and central nervous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65433 \">figure 1</a>).

These findings may be a cause of bladder outlet obstruction. Areas of skin excoriation or redness may be present, which may be a sign of continuous or severe urinary leakage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perianal inspection provides information about the position of the anus, and the presence of gluteal cleft deviation, dermatitis, and perianal feces, fissures, or hemorrhoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In a child with constipation, the abdominal examination may detect low to moderate tenderness due to colonic distension secondary to fecal impaction. The digital rectal examination may reveal a distended rectum that is full of stool. In addition, it provides information on perianal sensation and tone, and function of the anal sphincter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation of the urine stream &ndash; If possible, direct observation of the urinary stream during voiding should be performed. It allows the clinician to determine whether there is any evidence of hesitancy, dribbling, intermittency of voiding, or weak stream, which are all signs of bladder dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102364\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef102364 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of sexual or physical abuse &ndash; The physical examination should look for signs of physical or sexual abuse because bladder dysfunction can be a presenting sign for child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial laboratory testing generally does not provide additional useful diagnostic information and should be limited to a urinalysis and urine culture.</p><p>Findings on a urinalysis, preferably performed on a first morning void (ie, after a period of fluid restriction), may be suggestive of conditions that present with polyuria such as diabetes insipidus. These include a low specific gravity due to a renal concentrating defect or glycosuria due to diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H418670915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Specific gravity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Glucose'</a>.)</p><p>A urine culture should be obtained if the urinalysis is positive for urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite because children with bladder dysfunction have an increased risk of UTI. Children with UTI will often have a positive urinalysis for pyuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Urinary tract infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-microscopic-hematuria-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of microscopic hematuria in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum laboratory studies (eg, creatinine) are typically not part of the initial evaluation because abnormalities in overall renal function are rare in children with a normal urinalysis. If there is an abnormal urinalysis suggesting renal injury or disease (eg, urinary concentrating defect, proteinuria), a serum creatinine is obtained to estimate the glomerular filtration rate and check serum electrolytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of proteinuria in children&quot;, section on 'Approach to the child with proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of bladder dysfunction is based upon the presence of one or more of the following lower urinary tract symptoms, which are defined elsewhere.

These children require further neurologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract complications of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomical causes &ndash; Anatomical causes of bladder dysfunction may be suggested by symptoms of a weak stream, such as in boys with posterior urethral valves, or abnormalities detected by physical examination. Further assessment with imaging of the urological system is required to diagnosis an anatomical etiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysfunctional causes &ndash; Most idiopathic bladder dysfunction with no known neurologic or anatomic cause is suggested by findings from the initial evaluation, and a clinical diagnosis can be made based upon the presenting symptoms and signs. In most cases, behavioral therapeutic interventions aimed at retraining the bladder and urinary sphincter can be initiated based upon a clinical diagnosis of one of the following forms of bladder dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Daytime urinary incontinence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overactive bladder &ndash; The hallmark symptom of an overactive bladder is urgency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Voiding postponement &ndash; Children who voluntarily postpone voiding usually have a low voiding frequency rate with large volume voids. These children typically utilize holding maneuvers to suppress voiding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Underactive bladder &ndash; Some children with voiding postponement will develop underactive bladder with poor or absent bladder contraction. These children will demonstrate straining (eg, Valsalva maneuver) to aid in voiding, and have a weak and interrupted urinary stream. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Shape of urine flow curve'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Non-neurogenic dysfunctional voiding &ndash; Children with non-neurogenic dysfunctional voiding are unable to relax the urethral sphincter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic floor musculature during voiding. These children often have constipation resulting in bowel-bladder dysfunction, which was previously referred to as the dysfunctional elimination syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407969419\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for bladder dysfunction includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infection, which is diagnosed by a positive urine culture.

Bladder dysfunction, particularly daytime urinary incontinence, can be a source of major stress in school-age children. Thus, it is desirable to identify and treat affected children as early as possible.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of evaluating a child suspected of having bladder dysfunction is to confirm the presence or absence of an abnormality in bladder function and, if present, determine the underlying cause. In particular, evaluation should distinguish organic (ie, neurologic and anatomic) from functional causes of bladder dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect bladder dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The components of the initial evaluation are a thorough history that may include keeping a voiding diary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102378\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef102378 \">form 1</a>), focused physical examination, and laboratory testing (eg, urinalysis, urine culture, and, in some children, serum creatinine). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of bladder dysfunction is based upon the presence of one or more voiding symptoms that include urgency, hesitancy, dribbling, use of holding maneuvers to suppress voiding, abnormality of urinary flow including weak or intermittent urinary stream, and the use of abdominal straining during voiding. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Definitions of symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying cause of bladder dysfunction is often suggested by a constellation of signs and symptoms detected during the initial evaluation. Most cases are due to a functional cause (eg, overactive or underactive bladder), and in these children, behavioral therapeutic interventions aimed at retraining the bladder can be initiated based upon a clinical diagnosis.
