It occurs in at least 20 percent of the population, but most affected people do not seek medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although dyspepsia does not affect survival, it is responsible for substantial health care costs and significantly affects quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the definition, etiology, and general approach to the evaluation and management of the patient with dyspepsia. The evaluation and recommendations are largely consistent with the American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association guidelines for the evaluation of dyspepsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 25 percent of patients with dyspepsia have an underlying organic cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90590\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90590 \">table 1</a>). However, up to 75 percent of patients have functional (idiopathic or nonulcer) dyspepsia with no underlying cause on diagnostic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Although discomfort from ulcers is usually centered in the epigastrium, it may occasionally localize to the right or left upper quadrants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While classic symptoms of duodenal ulcer occur when acid is secreted in the absence of a food buffer (ie, two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach), peptic ulcers can be associated with food-provoked symptoms. Peptic ulcers can also be associated with postprandial belching, epigastric fullness, early satiation, fatty food intolerance, nausea, and occasional vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroesophageal</strong> <strong>malignancy</strong> &ndash; Gastroesophageal malignancy is an uncommon cause of chronic dyspepsia in the Western hemisphere but the incidence is higher in patients of Asian, Hispanic, or Afro-Caribbean extraction. The incidence of gastroesophageal malignancy increases with age. When present, abdominal pain tends to be epigastric, vague, and mild early in the disease but more severe and constant as the disease progresses. In addition, other symptoms and signs typically evolve with disease progression (eg, anemia, fatigue, weight loss).

The pain is often associated with diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is constant and not colicky. It is not exacerbated by movement and is not relieved by squatting, bowel movements, or passage of flatus. The pain typically lasts at least 30 minutes, plateauing within an hour. The pain then starts to subside, with an entire attack usually lasting less than six hours.

The presence of epigastric tenderness cannot accurately distinguish organic dyspepsia from functional dyspepsia. Abdominal tenderness on palpation should be evaluated with the Carnett sign to determine if it is due to pain arising from the abdominal wall rather than due to inflammation of the underlying viscera. The presence of increased local tenderness during muscle tensing (positive Carnett&rsquo;s sign) suggests the presence of abdominal wall pain. However, if the pain is decreased (negative Carnett&rsquo;s sign), the origin of pain is not from the abdominal wall and likely from an intra-abdominal organ, as the tensed abdominal wall muscles protect the viscera.

An approach to the evaluation of a patient with dyspepsia is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F115195\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115195 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Guidelines also suggest that the age cutoff may vary between countries, depending upon the prevalence of gastric cancer. The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines suggest that it may be reasonable in some resource-rich countries to consider the age of 60 or 65 years as the threshold age at which endoscopy should be offered to all new dyspeptic patients, while an age cutoff of 45 or 50 years may be more appropriate for United States patients of Asian, Hispanic, or Afro-Caribbean extraction or in populations with a high incidence of gastric cancer in young individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Most dyspeptic patients who are <em>H. pylori</em> positive and who are treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy persist with dyspeptic symptoms; the number needed to successfully relieve dyspeptic symptoms is estimated at one in seven. In a meta-analysis of two randomized trials in which 563 <em>H. pylori- </em>infected dyspepsia patients were assigned to eradication therapy or placebo, <em>H. pylori </em>eradication therapy resulted in a significant reduction in dyspepsia (RR remaining dyspeptic 0.81; 95% CI 0.70&ndash;0.94) with a number needed to treat of seven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>].

Dyspepsia symptoms were present in a significantly lower proportion of the PPI group as compared with controls (50 versus 73 percent). PPIs are also likely to be more effective at relieving symptoms of dyspepsia as compared with H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Although a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that included 2456 patients with dyspepsia did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between PPIs and H2RAs in providing symptom relief, the meta-analysis was limited by significant heterogeneity between studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
