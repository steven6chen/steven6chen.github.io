They are venerated elements of the art of medicine, the best series of diagnostic tests we have [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A relatively complete physical examination should be performed on each patient, regardless of the reason for the visit. Numerous medical anecdotes relate instances in which the examination revealed findings unrelated to and unexpected from the patient's chief complaint and major concerns. On occasion, a limited or inadequate examination may miss a significant condition, mass lesion, or potentially life-threatening condition.</p><p>The general principles, standard measurements, and overall approach to the pediatric patient are discussed here. Examination of specific organ systems is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: HEENT&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: Chest and abdomen&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: Back, extremities, nervous system, skin, and lymph nodes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: The perineum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After years of experience, seasoned examiners become aware of potential avoidable pitfalls often encountered upon entering a patient's room. Before entering the room, the clinician should review the patient's chart and confirm the identity of the patient and others in the room. Most clinicians have experienced the discomfort of walking into a room and greeting the patient, parent, or caregiver by the wrong name or of having the correct name but the wrong medical record.</p><p>To avoid a potentially embarrassing situation, the examiner should always knock on the door and await a response before entering. Small children standing on the other side can be injured easily by the door handle or by the door's impact as it is being opened.</p><p>Regardless of whether the clinician and caregiver have met previously, it is appropriate to greet everyone in a cordial manner, maintaining a professional yet friendly demeanor. Infants older than six months and anxious toddlers who are leery of strangers often are more comfortable when held by their caregiver. To gain the child's confidence and to avoid an early adversarial relationship, the clinician should try using a calm approach, a reassuring smile, and a toy or bright object as a diversion. An appropriate distance should be maintained during the history-taking portion. The clinician's approach should be cautious and nonthreatening once the physical examination is about to begin.</p><p>Infants younger than six months who have no stranger anxiety and children older than 30 to 36 months who are familiar with the examining clinician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who possess a trusting demeanor generally cooperate during the examination without being held. Physical examination of 5- to 12-year-old children usually is easy to perform because these children are not typically apprehensive and tend to be cooperative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">General appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examiner may gain significant insight into important social and family dynamics by observation alone when entering the patient's room. Terms used to describe a patient's general appearance include degree of comfort (calm, nervous, shy), state of well-being (normal, ill-appearing, distressed), activity level (sedate, alert, active, fidgety), physical appearance (neat, disheveled, unkempt), behavior and attitude (happy, sad, irritable, combative), body habitus (overweight, underweight, short, tall), and nutritional status (malnourished, normal, corpulent). The possibility of neglect should be considered if the child and caregiver make no eye contact or the patient lacks animation and has no social smile. Psychosocial intervention may be warranted in these circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child neglect and emotional maltreatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a child appears ill, particular attention should be paid to the way the patient has positioned himself or herself. A child who lies completely still on the examination table, is verbally responsive, but noticeably winces when an attempt is made to change position may have an acute abdomen (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;</a>). A dyspneic patient who is sitting upright and slightly forward with the arms extended and hands resting on the knees might be experiencing an exacerbation of asthma.</p><p>If an infant who is about to be examined is crying when the clinician enters the examination room, the pitch and intensity of the cry should be noted. A boisterous hardy cry is somewhat reassuring, whereas a weak and listless cry may indicate a seriously ill infant. A high-pitched, screeching cry could indicate increased intracranial pressure, reaction to a painful injury, toxic reaction, strangulated inguinal hernia, or other serious disorders.</p><p>Note the patient's breathing pattern and skin color. If the patient has rapid, shallow respiration yet appears to be in no acute distress, the underlying cause could be primary pulmonary disease or respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The examiner should evaluate the developmental status before touching the child. The patient's motor function, interaction with surrounding objects and people, response to sounds, and speech pattern give clues about whether the patient is normal or is in need of extensive developmental assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-behavioral-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care#H2099366119\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;, section on 'Approach to surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historical information depends almost completely upon the caregiver for patients in the neonatal age range through early childhood. To obtain pertinent information regarding a 5- to 12-year-old child, the clinician must still rely primarily on the caregiver, although attention should be given to the relevant, and often honest, comments made by the patient. Interview the adolescent patient in the absence of caregivers when appropriate so that pertinent historical information, anticipatory guidance, and preventive health care issues can be more openly discussed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guidelines for adolescent preventive services&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Key elements in the history-taking process include establishing a warm, caring atmosphere and asking questions in a nonconfrontational, unhurried manner. The terminology and language used by the examiner should be appropriate for the educational level of the caregiver and the patient. Good eye contact and a sense of undivided attention should be maintained. The clinician should sit opposite the caregiver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient at a comfortable distance, unencumbered by large objects, such as desks or tables. Outside interruption by the medical staff and by telephone calls should be kept to a minimum. An effort should be made to maintain an uninterrupted dialogue, to write few notes, and to refer to written data as little as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examiner should wash his or her hands thoroughly before beginning and after completing the examination. Protective gloves should be worn when appropriate. Patients and caregivers are well aware when the examiner fails to carry out this seemingly routine practice.</p><p>Skilled clinicians employ different techniques to gain pediatric patient cooperation. The use of toys, distracting objects, and pictures helps in the examination of young children, infants, and toddlers. Engaging the two- to four-year-old in stories or a discussion of imaginary animals frequently creates an effective diversion. Food, in the form of chewable snacks or liquid refreshments, can be used as a means of pacification, depending upon the stage of the examination.</p><p>When an otherwise normal-acting child older than four years fails to cooperate for an examination, even in the presence of a familiar caregiver, it may be an indication of either an earlier traumatic encounter between the patient and another examiner or a failure on the part of the current examining clinician to use the correct approach. An underlying psychosocial problem or personality defect should be suspected when a child who is older than four years is totally combative or extremely uncooperative.</p><p>For patients old enough to understand but who appear apprehensive, the examiner should explain what is going to be done during the examination and allow them to look at and touch any of the instruments to be used. Older patients should be warned in advance of potential pain or discomfort.</p><p>The examination of an infant, toddler, or child should be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian; if the parent&rsquo;s presence may interfere with the examination (eg, suspected child abuse), a chaperone should be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The use of a chaperone for the examination of the anorectal and genital areas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> breasts of female adolescent patients should be a shared decision between the patient and the clinician after the clinician has explained the reason for the examination and described how the examination will proceed. The sex of the chaperone should be determined by the patient&rsquo;s wishes and comfort (if possible). If a patient is offered the use of a chaperone and declines, this should be documented in the chart.</p><p>If the patient has a complaint, sign, or symptom that appears to involve a particular part of the anatomy, that part of the examination should be performed last. As an example, consider a patient complaining of right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain thought to be attributable to appendicitis; by not examining that part of the body first, the clinician may be able to divert the patient's attention away from the involved area and rule out other possible causes for the pain.</p><p>Patient privacy should be respected. If a patient objects to being unclothed or to wearing an examination gown, allow him or her to remain clothed until a specific part of the anatomy must be checked. When an area needs to be examined, the patient should be asked to remove or pull free the garments that are hindering visualization, palpation, or auscultation.</p><p>The order in which the physical examination is conducted often is age-specific and depends upon examiner preference. For an infant and younger child, the clinician may prefer to begin by examining the eyes, noting the red-light reflex, extraocular eye muscle movements, and visual tracking and then move to other parts of the body or organ systems before finally examining the ears, which are sensitive. For the older, more cooperative child, the examination might begin at the head and progress down the body, with the neurologic examination last. In general, the portions of the pediatric examination that require the most patient cooperation, such as blood pressure measurement, lung and heart auscultation, and eye and neurologic examinations, are performed initially. These examinations are followed by the more bothersome portions, including abdominal and ear examinations and measurement of head circumference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">STANDARD MEASUREMENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the standard growth parameters throughout childhood and adolescence is essential for assessing normal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management#H703490142\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management&quot;, section on 'Temperature measurement'</a>.) </p><p>Rectal temperature measurements should be taken with the patient in the prone position with the legs slightly flexed at the hips and knees; the thermometer is directed anteriorly at an angle of approximately 20&deg; to the surface of the examination table [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Battery-operated and electronic thermometers for recording oral or rectal temperatures generally are reliable and fast. The use of infrared tympanic membrane and temporal artery thermometers is discussed separately.

Accurate determination of the respiratory rate should be attempted only when the patient is asleep or at rest. It can be obtained by auscultation, palpation, or direct observation. Observation of chest wall movements is preferable to auscultation because auscultation may stimulate the child, falsely elevating the rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The normal range for the respiratory rate depends upon the age of the child. A systematic review of 20 studies provided respiratory rate percentiles for healthy children who were typically awake and at rest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A sustained breathing rate in excess of the upper limit of normal generally indicates primary respiratory tract disease; it may also occur secondary to a metabolic disorder, infectious disease, high fever, or underlying heart disease. The respiratory rate may increase by as many as 10 breaths per minute per degree (Celsius) of fever in children without pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; the effect of fever on respiratory rate in children with pneumonia has not been investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to one author, &quot;those who wish to know the inner body feel the pulse and thus have the fundamentals for diagnosis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The heart rate can be measured by direct auscultation or palpation of the heart or by palpation of peripheral arteries (carotids, femorals, brachials, or radials).</p><p>Like the respiratory rate, the normal heart rate varies with age. A systematic review of 59 studies provided heart rate percentiles for healthy children who were typically awake and at rest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Obtaining an accurate blood pressure reading in children under the age of three often is difficult. In most circumstances, routine blood pressure measurements should not be attempted in these children unless they have evidence of underlying renal disease, such as a tumor, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, or renal artery stenosis. Another reason for measuring the blood pressure in children under the age of three is the finding or suspicion of underlying cardiovascular disease, such as coarctation of the aorta or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Blood pressure devices include the standard extremity cuff and mercury bulb sphygmomanometer, the hand-held aneroid manometer, and the Doppler and oscillometric devices. Patients old enough to understand should be shown the blood pressure device before the examiner attempts to take a measurement. The patient should be allowed to play with the device or feel the cuff inflate to gain his or her cooperation. The proper technique for blood pressure measurement is discussed separately.
