Those with deformations due to intrinsic factors are at increased risk for other fetal abnormalities (eg, renal disease or central nervous system disorder).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic fetal causes include primary neuromuscular disorders resulting in decreased fetal movement, and renal disease resulting in decreased production of amniotic fluid and oligohydramnios, which increases the risk of fetal compression from outside forces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrinsic causes are primarily due to factors that lead to fetal crowding and restricted fetal movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oligohydramnios from leakage of amniotic fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Breech position, in which movement of the fetal legs are restricted due to entrapment between the body of the fetus and the uterine wall. Breech position increases the risk of deformations 10-fold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormalities of the amniotic cavity such as the presence of uterine tumors or deformities (eg, bicornuate uterus or septated uterus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple fetuses or very large fetus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compression of the amniotic cavity affecting its size and shape due to a small maternal pelvis and the size of neighboring maternal organs.</p><p/><p>During the last trimester, the impact of external factors increases as the fetus grows and the amniotic fluid decreases. As a result, positional deformities are more common in term infants than preterm infants. This was illustrated in one study that reported no rotational deformities (eg, medial tibial torsion) in preterm infants with gestational ages &le;30 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The assessment of deformities in the newborn must include a thorough physical examination to detect any neurologic or other musculoskeletal abnormality that may have been an intrinsic cause of the deformity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOT DEFORMITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common positional deformities of the feet include metatarsus adductus, positional calcaneovalgus feet, and clubfoot (talipes equinovarus). In a study of 2401 consecutive newborns, the incidence of foot deformities was 4.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Seventy-six percent of cases were due to metatarsus adductus, and 18 percent were due to calcaneovalgus feet. Almost all of the patients had normal feet at follow-up at five or six years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Metatarsus adductus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metatarsus adductus is the most common congenital foot deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is characterized by medial deviation (adduction) of the forefoot while the hindfoot remains in a normal position, thus forming a &quot;C&quot; shape, or concavity of the medial aspect of the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57425 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The reported incidence is about 1 to 2 per 1000 live births and is increased in families with a history of metatarsus adductus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. It appears to occur more commonly in first-born children due to the increased molding effect from the primigravida uterus and abdominal wall. The incidence is higher in twin compared with singleton births, but the frequency of metatarsus adductus appears to be similar in preterm and term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical findings and assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metatarsus adductus is characterized by medial deviation of the forefoot, which is usually slightly supinated while the hindfoot remains neutral. A deep medial crease is generally present. Metatarsus adductus is often bilateral; when unilateral, it occurs more often on the left than on the right (for unknown reasons) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is the most common cause of in-toeing gait in the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the walking child, abnormal shoe wear may occur.</p><p>Two classification systems have been used to evaluate the severity of this condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60426 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first is known as the heel bisector, in which the severity of metatarsus adductus is determined by the relationship of the toes to the projected axis of the foot that bisects the heel and normally extends through the second toe. The severity of the condition increases as the heel axis moves more laterally in relationship to the toes. However, the severity based upon this classification schema does not correlate with the prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing#H25515563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with in-toeing&quot;, section on 'Focused examination of the lower extremities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second defines severity by the degree of flexibility of the forefoot. Flexibility is based upon the ability to correct the metatarsus adduction by providing lateral pressure on the forefoot over the first metatarsal while firmly holding the heel in a neutral position with the other hand. In infants with flexible metatarsus adductus, spontaneous correction generally occurs. Therapy is reserved for those with rigid (severe) or moderately inflexible metatarsus adductus. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Although historically hip dysplasia had been associated with metatarsus adductus, data have demonstrated no association between the two conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As part of the normal routine care practice, the hips should be examined at every health-supervision visit until the child is walking normally (usually by two years of age). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p>Radiographs are generally not necessary in infants with metatarsus adductus. They are indicated for toddlers or older children with persistent deformity to determine if another condition, such as clubfoot and skewfoot (complex foot deformity with medial deviation of the forefoot, lateral translation of the midfoot, and valgus hindfoot), is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing#H21546674\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with in-toeing&quot;, section on 'Uncommon pathologic causes of in-toeing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all cases of metatarsus adductus (over 90 percent) will resolve without intervention. Treatment, if needed, is dependent on the severity of the condition based upon the degree of flexibility of the affected foot, as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60426 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &minus; Mildly affected feet can be passively overcorrected into abduction with little effort. In these patients, treatment is not necessary as resolution will occur spontaneously over time. Overcorrection with passive and active stretching may lead to mild abduction. As a result, stretching exercises should not be performed in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &minus; Moderately deformed feet will passively correct only to the neutral position. Passive stretching exercises are commonly recommended; however, it is unclear whether or not they are efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The exercises consist of laterally directed pressure on the head of the first metatarsal to correct the malalignment; the position should be held for 10 seconds; it should be performed five times per foot whenever the infant's diaper is changed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>Although controversial, management with an orthotic splint or corrective shoes has been suggested to benefit infants with moderately flexible metatarsus adductus, but these measures have not been shown to be beneficial.</p><p>Patients should be reevaluated on a regular basis and may require casting if no improvement is seen.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe &minus; In severe or rigid metatarsus adductus, the forefoot is unable to be passively abducted to the midline. In these cases, corrective casting is required. Results are best with early treatment before eight months of age as the deformity may worsen over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/9,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,14</a>].</p><p/><p>In one case series of 65 infants with moderate (37 feet) and severe (48 feet) metatarsus adductus, below-knee plaster casting corrected the deformity within six to eight weeks in all cases. At a mean follow-up of four years, correction was maintained in all children with initial moderate deformity, and of the 44 feet with severe deformity available for examination, six had a moderate deformity, one had a severe deformity, and the remaining maintained the correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Surgical correction is controversial. It may be an option for the older child with persistent metatarsus adductus, but the reported incidences are high for failure (about 40 percent) and complications (about 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Complications include skin slough and persistent pain with prominence of the tarsal metatarsal joints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, the outcome for patients without intervention or with nonsurgical treatment for metatarsus adductus is excellent. This was illustrated in a case series of 31 patients (45 feet) with metatarsus adductus who were followed for a mean of 32.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At initial presentation, 12 patients (16 feet) with mild deformity received no treatment, 20 patients (29 feet) with moderate and severe deformity were treated with serial manipulation and casting, and 1 patient had bilateral involvement with no treatment on one foot and intervention on the other. No patient was treated with surgical correction. Excellent results were seen in all patients with mild deformity without treatment and in 90 percent of the more severely affected feet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Positional calcaneovalgus feet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positional calcaneovalgus feet, also referred to as talipes calcaneovalgus, is a common foot deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is characterized by hyperdorsiflexion of the foot with the abduction of the forefoot, which often results in the forefoot resting on the anterior surface of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58256\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58256 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72144\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72144 \">picture 3</a>).

Congenital vertical talus has a fixed dislocation of the navicular dorsolaterally on the head of the talus. The ability to correct (or partially correct) the deformity with gentle pressure usually distinguishes the more flexible calcaneovalgus feet from the rigid congenital vertical talus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In cases where the examination is inconclusive, a radiograph can differentiate between the two conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paralytic calcaneus foot deformity is seen in infants with a neuromuscular disorder (eg, myelodysplasia or polio), which results in the absence or paralysis of the gastrocsoleus muscle. The physical examination should differentiate between paralytic and positional calcaneovalgus feet by detecting a motor deficit in the former condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-issues-in-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic issues in myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posteromedial bow of the tibia is a condition that includes both a calcaneovalgus foot and a bowed, shortened tibia.

In utero, the fetus's hips are typically flexed, abducted, and externally rotated while the lower legs are internally rotated and the knees flexed. With intrauterine crowding and mechanical restriction, this position predisposes the fetus to rotational deformities that include internal and external tibial torsion and external rotation of the hips, which may result in physiologic genu varum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal tibial torsion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internal tibial torsion is a normal rotational variant and is a result of intrauterine positioning. It is the most common cause of in-toeing in toddlers as they begin to walk. It may also be associated with metatarsus adductus and genu varum. Internal tibial torsion is bilateral in approximately two-thirds of cases; in unilateral cases the left side is more commonly involved for unknown reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>On examination, the infant with internal tibial torsion will have a medially deviated foot when the patella is facing directly forward. The degree of torsion or rotation can be measured by the thigh-foot angle, the angular difference between the axis of the foot and the axis of the thigh when the patient is in the prone position with the knees flexed 90 degrees and the foot and ankle in neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68556 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Increased external tibial torsion is also associated with neuromuscular disorders including myelodysplasia and polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-positional-deformations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As a result, a careful neurologic examination should be performed in patients with this finding.</p><p>As with other positional deformities, intervention is usually not required as the majority of affected children will have spontaneous resolution.

As opposed to a true clubfoot, the positional clubfoot easily corrects to a normal position with manipulation and will resolve spontaneously over time. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Positional clubfoot'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis of talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Internal and external tibial torsion are rotational deformities that typically present as in-toeing (internal tibial torsion) and out-toeing (external tibial torsion) when the child begins to ambulate. With normal growth and development, both conditions generally resolve spontaneously without intervention. Surgical treatment is rarely indicated and is reserved for the older child with marked functional or cosmetic deformity. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Internal tibial torsion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'External tibial torsion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic genu varum (also referred to as physiologic bowing) is a positional deformity that is characterized by external rotational at the hip and internal tibial torsion. It is typically detected in the older infant and toddler shortly after ambulation begins. Physiologic genu varum generally resolves spontaneously and must be differentiated from pathologic causes, such as Blount's disease, which may require intervention.
