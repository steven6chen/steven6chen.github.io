The identification of a cytopathic retrovirus in 1983 and development of a diagnostic serologic test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1985 have served as the basis for developing improvements in diagnosis.</p><p>In addition, therapy was dramatically altered with the introduction of antiretroviral drugs in 1987 and revolutionized by combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996. In the three years following the introduction of ART, mortality, AIDS, AIDS-defining diagnoses, and hospitalizations all decreased 60 to 80 percent. The EuroSIDA study, comparing this early ART period with pre-ART and later ART (1998 to 2002) treatment periods, found a sustained decrease in mortality and progression to AIDS with ongoing ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite the absence of a cure, the natural history of the disease was radically changed and patients with HIV infection without other significant comorbidities who are treated appropriately can expect to have a life expectancy the same as the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Despite these advances, it is still useful to review the natural history of HIV infection without ART and the classification of disease. Although modified from the initial case definition, the newer Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification system remains the cornerstone for diagnosing HIV and AIDS.</p><p>This topic reviews the case definition, stages, and natural history of HIV infection. The epidemiology of HIV infection, factors that influence the natural history of HIV infection, and the impact of ART on the natural history are discussed elsewhere.

Organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) have established case definitions to standardize the description of HIV infection cases.

As an example, in a study of 3257 men who have sex with men (MSM) in six United States cities, risk factors for HIV acquisition included history of a large number of sexual partners, unprotected receptive anal sex with a partner with an unknown HIV serostatus, and use of nitrate inhalants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexually transmitted infections</strong> &ndash; The presence of other STIs also increases the risk of HIV acquisition, as demonstrated in a study of 174 monogamous Ugandan couples with discordant HIV serostatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].

Although Fiebig staging is typically used for research purposes, it is becoming more relevant to clinical practice due to increasing awareness of the advantages of recognizing early and acute HIV infection in order to allow early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, which has several known and potential benefits.

However, cell death and replacement are in near balance during this phase of the illness; thus, the decline in CD4 cell count is typically slow and a relatively steady state of viral load is achieved despite remarkably high turnover rates of HIV and CD4 cells. As an example, the HIV RNA levels are usually stable over time, with only rare changes exceeding 1 log [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The half-life of HIV in serum is approximately 1.2 days, about 24 hours intracellularly, and about six hours as extracellular virus. About 30 percent of the total body viral burden is turned over daily. Furthermore, 6 to 7 percent of the total CD4 cells turns over each day, and the entire supply of CD4 cells turns over every 15 days. The implication of these observations is that &quot;AIDS is primarily a consequence of continuous, high-level replication of HIV, leading to virus and immune-mediated killing of CD4 lymphocytes&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The lymphoid tissue serves as the major reservoir for HIV. Studies of the lymph nodes at this stage reveal high concentrations of extracellular HIV on the follicular dendritic cell processes within germinal centers and intracellular HIV predominantly in its latent form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The viral burden in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is relatively low at this time. The lymph node architecture is disrupted and more HIV is released peripherally into the bloodstream as the disease progresses.</p><p>Eradication of this latent reservoir of HIV has been a focus of novel interventions aimed at curing the infection. However, diagnostic techniques are not yet sensitive enough to accurately confirm elimination of the viral reservoir. This was illustrated by a highly publicized study of two HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who underwent stem cell transplants for hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Following the transplants, while the patients continued ART, they had undetectable plasma viral levels and neither viral RNA nor proviral DNA was detectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or gut-associated lymphoid tissue from rectal samples, through sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and co-culture assays. However, following ART discontinuation to assess for potential viral eradication, both patients experienced symptomatic rebound viremia several months later.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview of stages of HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection is usually acquired through sexual intercourse, exposure to contaminated blood, or perinatal transmission. Risk factors for transmission include high viral load, certain sexual behaviors, presence of ulcerative sexually transmitted infections (STIs), lack of circumcision, and certain host and genetic factors. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Viral transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acute retroviral syndrome is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, rash, <span class=\"nowrap\">myalgia/arthralgia,</span> and headache, although a proportion of patients with early HIV infection will be asymptomatic. Early HIV infection is a period of rapid viral replication with typically very high viral RNA levels. By approximately six months of infection, plasma viremia has reached a steady state level. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Acute and early HIV infection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The period of chronic HIV infection following early infection and seroconversion but prior to the development of severe immunosuppression is characterized by stability of viral levels and a progressive decline in CD4 cell count. The rate of CD4 cell decline correlates with the level of viremia. During this stage, the majority of HIV-infected patients are asymptomatic, although some may have generalized lymphadenopathy. However, certain HIV-associated clinical findings, such as thrush, seborrheic dermatitis, and susceptibility to herpesvirus and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, bacterial pneumonia, and tuberculosis, frequently occur despite a CD4 cell count &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Chronic HIV infection, without AIDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIDS is defined by a CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or the presence of any AIDS-defining condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59724 \">table 5</a>) regardless of the CD4 cell count. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'AIDS and advanced HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIDS-defining conditions are opportunistic illnesses that occur more frequently or more severely in immunocompromised hosts. These include mainly opportunistic infections, such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, and disseminated <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> infection. Certain malignancies (Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma), as well as conditions without clear alternative etiology thought to be related to uncontrolled HIV infection itself, such as wasting or encephalopathy, are also AIDS-defining conditions. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'AIDS defining conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A minority of HIV infected patients, despite not being on antiretroviral therapy (ART), do not develop clinical progression and have stable CD4 cell counts and low levels of detectable viremia (&lt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span>. They are considered long-term nonprogressors. A subset of these patients are referred to as elite controllers because they have no detectable viremia, even on ultrasensitive diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"#H82010217\" class=\"local\">'Long-term nonprogressors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-1 causes the vast majority of HIV infections worldwide, although HIV-2 is an important cause of infection in certain regions of the world, such as West Africa. Compared with HIV-1, HIV-2 infection is characterized by lower levels of plasma virus, slower declines in the CD4 cell count, and a longer asymptomatic period of chronic infection.
