Immunocompromised hosts are defined by susceptibility to infection with organisms of little native virulence in normal individuals. Each group of hosts (eg, AIDS, solid organ transplant recipients, or hematopoietic cell transplant recipients) has enhanced susceptibility to a subset of pathogens depending upon the nature of the underlying immune defects. The impact of antibody-based therapies targeting T and B lymphocytes and inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha should be considered in the assessment of risk.</p><p>Survival has improved with the availability of newer antimicrobial agents, including azole antifungals, macrolides, antivirals, and antiretroviral drugs. Despite these advances, pulmonary infection remains the most common form of documented tissue invasive infection observed in these hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>Common pulmonary infections in the immunocompromised host will be reviewed here. The risk of pneumonia and approaches to the evaluation and diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in the immunocompromised individual and the treatment of specific disease entities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infectious risks associated with specific immunomodulating agents are discussed separately.

These may include dual infection with <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) or superimposition of another process (lung injury or drug toxicity). Sequential infections (eg, viral infection preceding bacterial or fungal infection) are common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early imaging (computed tomography [CT] scan) and specific microbiologic diagnoses are essential to the care of immunocompromised patients. Invasive procedures (biopsies and bronchoscopy) are often necessary to establish a microbiologic diagnosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and advanced diagnostic testing including immunohistology and quantitative molecular assays are essential components of the management of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. The importance of specific microbiologic diagnoses in the care of immunocompromised individuals cannot be overemphasized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microbicidal therapy must be started as soon as possible. Empiric therapy should be based upon the data that are available (epidemiologic history, sputum Gram stain, special stains, prior microbiologic data, previous courses of antimicrobial agents). Overly broad antimicrobial therapy can be modified based upon new microbiologic data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction of the overall level of immune suppression may be as important as antimicrobial therapy in the ultimate success of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory assay results must be interpreted cautiously and must take into account the clinical context of each patient. As examples, detection of galactomannan or CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid do not necessarily represent invasive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis#H169260052\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients#H694915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in lung transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'Culture'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of a specific pathogen is influenced by the patient's underlying innate and adaptive immune defects. In practice, most patients have mixed immune defects.</p><p>The encapsulated bacteria as a group are of greatest concern in patients with underlying or induced humoral immune deficiencies with accompanying diminished opsonizing capacity. Severe pneumonia secondary to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is described in patients with functional asplenia, hematologic malignancy, transplantation, or immunoglobulin deficiency. In addition, immune deficiency prevents the development of complete protective immunity after pneumococcal immunization, although infection seems less severe in vaccinated compromised individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The presence of intracellular organisms (eg, Mycobacteria, <em>Legionella</em>, <em>Nocardia</em>, <em>Strongyloides</em>) and infection due to yeasts (eg, <em>Cryptococcus</em>), dimorphic mycoses (eg, <em>Histoplasma</em>), or molds (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em>) reflect decreased cell-mediated immunity or macrophage function. Such infections have become prominent in patients receiving T lymphocyte immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies for rheumatologic diseases or inflammatory bowel disease. <em>Nocardia</em> and staphylococcal infections are more common in patients with neutrophil dysfunction (chronic granulomatous disease) or neutropenia but may also occur in patients receiving glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T cell suppression. As an example, organ transplant recipients who require long-term immune suppression are at greater risk for unusual infections (eg, <em>Nocardia</em>, nontuberculous mycobacteria) than immunocompetent adults.</p><p>The immunocompromised patient is also more likely to present with disseminated disease, including involvement of the central nervous system (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em> species, mycobacterial, or <em>Nocardia</em> infections). When disseminated disease is being considered, magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system, sampling of the cerebrospinal fluid, and bone imaging (eg, bone scan) are helpful in the detection of metastatic infection and the assessment of the efficacy of therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nocardiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of nocardiosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-nervous-system-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central nervous system tuberculosis&quot;</a>).</p><p>Multiple genetic polymorphisms have been described that predispose to specific infections such as <em>Aspergillus</em> or cytomegalovirus infections. Genetic mutations have also been described for immunodeficiencies recognized in patients with recurrent infections. In general, such individuals present with chronic or recurrent bacterial, fungal, or viral infections of the skin, sinuses, respiratory, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal tract. Many develop autoimmune conditions, malignancies, atypical rashes, paucity of lymphoid tissue or lymphadenopathy, and unusual reactions or unresponsiveness to common vaccines. These disorders may affect both humoral and cellular immune functions as well as defects in innate immunity, complement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> phagocytosis. The evaluation of such individuals is described elsewhere.

These infections can be divided into the following general categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Community acquired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nosocomial</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactivation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental exposure</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Community-acquired infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial pneumonia in the immunocompromised host most often involves the same pathogens acquired in the community by immunocompetent hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient in the community often follows an infection caused by respiratory viruses, atypical pathogens, or cytomegalovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These postviral infections are of greater severity with rapid onset of progression and high morbidity. Knowledge of the local epidemiology of infection (eg, prevalence of metapneumovirus or influenza A in the community) may guide the approach to diagnosis and therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The potential for antimicrobial resistance in the compromised host population exceeds that in the general population, in part because of exposures to the hospital environment and to antimicrobial agents for treatment and prophylaxis and, frequently, ongoing microbial replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Inadequate initial (empiric) therapy of pneumonia has been linked to increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) or healthcare-associated infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) or healthcare-associated infections arise in patients with preexisting lung injury (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis), during intubation, or following aspiration. This is a particular problem in patients who are debilitated, have hepatic or renal dysfunction, encephalopathy, or are otherwise unable to protect their airways. Hematogenous seeding of the lungs (septic emboli) in association with bacteremia or fungemia is common in neutropenic hosts, often in association with vascular access catheters, and may be observed with skin or gastrointestinal lesions.</p><p>These pneumonias usually involve relatively antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacilli or fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For example, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em>, and <em>Burkholderia cepacia </em>are particularly resistant organisms that can colonize skin, catheters, endotracheal tubes, wound hematomas, and tracheal anastomoses. Patients with cystic fibrosis and lung and liver transplant recipients are especially vulnerable to infection with these organisms. Once these organisms cause a pulmonary infection, a combination of ablative surgery and prolonged courses of bactericidal antimicrobial agents may be required for cure. Streptococci, including those resistant to fluoroquinolones used for prophylaxis, have been implicated in pneumonia in these hosts.</p><p>Lung transplant patients have a higher risk of developing pulmonary infection than other transplant recipients. This occurs for several reasons, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preexisting colonization of the host or organ donor by relatively resistant organisms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical trauma of the transplanted lung (suture line infection, disruption of lymphatic drainage, diminished vascular supply)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical factors (diminished ciliary function and cough reflex) and intubation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression</p><p/><p>Infections in lung transplant recipients are discussed in greater detail separately.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria are commonly found in water supplies. Exposure to soil has been linked to infections with <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Nocardia </em>spp or to <em>Penicillium marneffei</em> and <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei </em>in Southeast Asia. <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> strains from soil have been demonstrated to match clinical isolates in cystic fibrosis patients using genotyping techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Increasing resistance of pneumococci to penicillin and other antimicrobials is notable.

Thus, tuberculosis must be considered in these patients with pulmonary infiltrates.</p><p>The nature and time course of immunosuppression is also an important factor to consider. Acute neutropenia may provoke the rapid onset of infection due to invasive nosocomial or colonizing organisms (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>). Successful empiric therapy generally includes agents active against organisms previously identified in the individual.

The natural reservoir of infection remains unknown. Aerosol transmission of infection has been demonstrated by a number of investigators in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Clusters of infections have been documented in HIV-infected patients, renal transplant recipients, and patients with hematologic malignancies; one genotyping study showed that person-to-person transmission could occur in these settings but is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Both new exposures and reactivation of undertreated prior infections remain significant factors in the incidence of disease in immunocompromised hosts.

Risk of infection is strongly associated with immune suppression that includes chronic glucocorticoid administration or T lymphocyte depletion; bolus glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitor use contribute to the risk of infection and increased mortality. Prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis</em> should be administered unless there are contraindications.

In transplant recipients, <em>Pneumocystis </em>pneumonia (PCP) is generally an acute or subacute infection. In lung transplant recipients, the rate of asymptomatic isolation of <em>P. jirovecii</em> approaches two-thirds of the total in some series. Of these, up to one-half are expected to develop symptomatic disease without treatment. For other immunocompromised patients without HIV infection, 5 to 12 percent of patients who are not receiving prophylaxis will develop pneumocystosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In patients with untreated HIV, PCP is a more rapidly progressive process with a greater organism burden than in non-HIV-infected immunocompromised hosts. The risk of PCP has declined in patients with HIV infection since the advent of antiretroviral therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspergillus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis may present as a primary infection acquired from a nosocomial or environmental source or occur due to failure to clear organisms that are already present in airways that are damaged by surgery or underlying disease. Infection due to non-fumigatus strains of <em>Aspergillus</em> and other molds with differing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns may result in similar clinical presentations; hence, specific microbial diagnosis is essential for guiding therapy.</p><p>The risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis appears to be high once the respiratory tract, sinuses, or trachea are colonized and immunosuppression is maintained. Preemptive antifungal therapy may be indicated when colonization is noted or prophylaxis can be given in the highest risk patients (eg, acute leukemia undergoing chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT] with graft-versus-host disease).

Some patients already have extrapulmonary disease at the time of diagnosis; the brain and skin are the most common sites involved.

Occasionally, subacute consolidation with influenza-like symptoms may be noted. However, in one retrospective review of patients (the majority of whom were solid organ transplant recipients) with pulmonary cryptococcosis, clinical symptoms were present in 74 percent of 38 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The most frequent symptoms were shortness of breath, cough, and fever. The presence of a pleural effusion was a poor prognostic factor by multivariate regression analysis, and overall mortality was 24 percent. Our own clinical experience suggests that asymptomatic infection remains common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The major importance of cryptococcal pulmonary infection is that the lung is the portal of entry for disseminated infection, which frequently involves the central nervous system. Thus, an aggressive diagnostic evaluation must be initiated even for asymptomatic infection.

Fungemia commonly results from infection of indwelling vascular access catheters and infection related to transplant surgery (particularly of the pancreas or liver). Other <em>Candida</em> species (eg, <em>Candida glabrata</em> and <em>Candida krusei</em>) have become more frequent pathogens in these hosts, possibly as a result of nosocomial exposures and prior exposure to prophylactic agents including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>.

The attack rate and severity of pneumonia is greater in recipients of lung allografts than in the other transplant groups. The overall likelihood of developing CMV illness (infection or disease) in lung transplant recipients is approximately 50 percent.

In contrast, the greatest risk for CMV pneumonitis following hematopoietic cell transplantation occurs in the seropositive recipient of seronegative stem cells. The incidence of CMV is related to the intensity of the immunosuppressive therapy. CMV infections have increased in the face of T lymphocyte&ndash;depleting therapies used in all forms of organ and stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Much of the lung injury in the HCT recipient is due to immune responses to CMV antigens. Thus, a pneumonitis syndrome may not occur until after the reemergence of immune function with hematopoietic engraftment.

Each group of hosts (eg, AIDS, solid organ transplantation, or hematopoietic cell transplantation) has enhanced susceptibility to a subset of pathogens depending upon the nature of the underlying immune defects. The risk for severe pulmonary infection should be considered a reflection of the intensity, persistence, and nature of immune deficiencies. The impact of antibody-based therapies targeting T and B lymphocytes and inflammatory mediators should be considered in the assessment of risk.
