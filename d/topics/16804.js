That's because as people get older, unwanted or harmful side effects from certain medicines become more common. Plus, the medicines last longer in the body.</p><p>The next time you see your doctor or nurse, put all the medicines you take into a bag and bring them with you. Make sure you include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All your prescription medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All the non-prescription medicines you take, including vitamins and medicines such as Tylenol or Advil</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any herbal or &quot;natural&quot; products you take</p><p/><p>During your visit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask if you should still be taking all of the medicines you currently take. People sometimes end up taking more medicines than they really need.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask whether the combination of medicines you take could cause a problem or &quot;drug interaction.&quot; A drug interaction is when a medicine, food, or supplement changes the effects of another medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell your doctor or nurse about any symptoms you are having that you think are due to one of your medicines. He or she might be able to lower your dose, switch you to a different medicine, or deal with the symptoms in other ways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell your doctor or nurse if you can't afford your medicines. He or she might be able to switch you to a less expensive medicine or suggest other solutions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4946103\"><span class=\"h1\">Interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes 2 medicines that are safe to take by themselves are actually unsafe to take together. When certain medicines are taken together, they can cause serious side effects or other problems. This can happen not just when 2 medicines are combined, but also when a medicine is combined with a specific food, or an herbal drug. Here are some examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a><strong> (brand name: Coumadin) + ginkgo biloba</strong> &ndash; The prescription medicine warfarin helps keep blood clots from forming. People take it to prevent strokes, heart attacks, and other problems. Ginkgo biloba is an herbal drug that is popular in the US. People take it for lots of reasons, including the hope that it will keep them mentally sharp. But when the 2 drugs are taken together, they can seriously increase the risk of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Saint John's wort + antidepressants</strong> &ndash; The herbal drug Saint John's wort can help with mild forms of depression. But people sometimes take it when they're already taking an antidepressant. This combination can have dangerous consequences. It can lead to a condition called serotonin syndrome, which is life-threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4946118\"><span class=\"h1\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People of all ages can have side effects from medicines, but older people are more likely to have some side effects. For example, older people are more likely to feel sleepy, confused, dizzy, or unsteady with certain medicines. This can be especially dangerous for them, because it increases the chances that they will fall.</p><p>If you tend to feel sleepy, confused, dizzy, or unsteady, tell your doctor or nurse. Your medicines might or might not be the reason for your symptoms. Either way, it's important for your doctor or nurse to know about them. And if the symptoms are side effects of your medicines, your doctor or nurse might be able to lower your dose, switch you to a different medicine, or offer another solution.</p><p>A common side effect in older men is trouble urinating. A number of different medicines can cause this side effect, including allergy medicines or sleeping pills. Talk to your doctor if you start a new medicine and find you have trouble starting the flow of urine, or your urine stream is weaker than it used to be.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4946135\"><span class=\"h1\">Ways to protect yourself</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To lower the chances that you'll have problems related to the medicines you take, follow these steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that your main doctor, and any other doctor or nurse who prescribes medicines for you knows about <strong>all</strong> of the medicines you take. This includes any over-the-counter or herbal medicines you use on a regular basis. Ask your doctor or nurse to go over all your medicines with you at least once a year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep a list of all the medicines you take that includes the dose you take, your reason for taking it, and the doctor or nurse who prescribed it. You can find an example of this kind of list at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm079489.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IOhw8tWkhkVaWidZQDUIbu9gDMhwPSip8u9zifYOMQtFzUgxleN7AXwBD6pfdpaGrA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16625\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anytime your doctor or nurse puts you on a new medicine, ask:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Why am I taking this medicine?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What are the common problems to watch out for?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What should I do if they happen?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When should I stop this medicine?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Can I take this medicine with the other medicines on my list?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What will happen if I don't take this medicine?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When you pick up a new prescription, ask your pharmacist if there are foods, supplements, or other medicines that you should avoid while taking your medicine. Your pharmacist is a great resource. Ask him or her any questions you might have about your medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep medicines in their original containers and read the instructions that come with them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4946152\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-you-have-multiple-health-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When you have multiple health problems (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
