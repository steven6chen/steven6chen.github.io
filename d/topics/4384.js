The incidence of perforation is influenced by the etiology of the stricture, the experience of the endoscopist, and the techniques and equipment used. In general, perforation rates associated with esophageal stricture dilation are low, unlike procedures such as pneumatic dilation for achalasia, where perforations are estimated to complicate three to five percent of procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection for achalasia&quot;, section on 'Esophageal perforation'</a>.)</p><p>Studies suggest that the perforation rate associated with the dilation of benign strictures is between 0.1 and 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perforation rate was 0.1 percent per session in a report from 1999 that looked at 1043 dilation sessions using Eder-Puestow or Savary dilators in 153 patients (over half of whom had peptic strictures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar perforation rate was found in a report in which 1071 benign strictures were dilated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, studies examining whether patients with eosinophilic esophagitis are at increased risk have had variable results, and we believe it is prudent to continue to view patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as being at increased risk for perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis#H209738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Esophageal dilation'</a>.):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 37 studies including 977 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and over 2000 dilations, perforation occurred in nine patients (0.03 percent). It was concluded that perforation from esophageal dilation in eosinophilic esophagitis is rare, and esophageal dilation should be considered a safe procedure in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review found only one perforation associated with 671 esophageal dilations (0.1 percent) in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, a rate that is similar to the expected perforation rate for patients without eosinophilic esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, an increased perforation rate was noted in a study in which there were three perforations among 293 dilations (1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with an esophageal perforation present for evaluation within 24 hours of the injury, though in some cases the presentation may be delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The clinical features of esophageal perforation depend upon the location of the perforation (cervical, intrathoracic, or intra-abdominal), the degree of leakage, and the time elapsed since the injury occurred. Cervical perforations are typically less severe than intrathoracic or intra-abdominal perforations, though contamination of the mediastinum can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The most common symptom is pain, occurring in more than 70 percent of patients with intrathoracic perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients may develop tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever, which can progress rapidly to sepsis and shock. Auscultation of the chest in patients with mediastinal emphysema (pneumomediastinum) may reveal a crunching noise (&quot;Hamman's sign&quot;). </p><p>Additional signs and symptoms may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical perforation may be associated with neck pain, tenderness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, dysphonia, hoarseness, cervical dysphagia, and cervical subcutaneous emphysema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrathoracic perforation results in contamination of the mediastinum and may also extend into the pleural cavity (most often on the left). It is most commonly associated with chest, back, or epigastric pain that is exacerbated with inspiration and swallowing. Patients may also have dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspnea, hematemesis, cyanosis, and, rarely, pericardial tamponade if the perforation involves the posterior pericardium. Mediastinal inflammation may eventually result in cervical subcutaneous emphysema. Due to negative intrathoracic pressure, gastric contents and bacteria may be drawn into the pleural space. Patients may develop signs of sepsis and shock within hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intra-abdominal perforation results in contamination of the peritoneal cavity. Patients may report back pain and an inability to lie supine. In addition, patients often report epigastric pain that may radiate to the shoulder. Patients may also present with an acute (surgical) abdomen. As with intrathoracic perforation, patients may rapidly deteriorate. </p><p/><p>The laboratory evaluation may reveal a leukocytosis. While not part of the diagnostic workup for an esophageal perforation, pleural fluid collected during thoracentesis may contain undigested food, have a pH less than 6, or have an elevated salivary amylase level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154482667\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with pain following esophageal dilation have a perforation. Nonspecific chest pain following esophageal dilation is not uncommon, though it is typically mild, self-limited, and lacks the associated signs and symptoms seen with a perforation, such as subcutaneous emphysema. An exception is the pain associated with esophageal dilation with stent placement, which may be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In addition, some patients will complain of abdominal discomfort resulting from air insufflation. Like patients with nonspecific chest pain, the abdominal discomfort is typically mild and transient. (See <a href=\"#H154484442\" class=\"local\">'Nonspecific chest pain'</a> below.)</p><p>Chest or abdominal pain may also be seen with disorders such as myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer perforation, aortic aneurysm dissection, spontaneous pneumothorax, or pneumonia. However, the history of a recent esophageal dilation makes these disorders less likely. </p><p>In general, an esophageal perforation should be excluded if the patient's pain is moderate to severe, if it fails to improve after one to two hours, or if there are other symptoms suggestive of a perforation. In addition, patients with post-procedure pain should be given nothing by mouth until it is clear that their pain is improving. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An esophageal perforation should be suspected in patients who develop significant neck, chest, or abdominal pain following endoscopy. Generally, the evaluation starts with an examination for signs of a perforation (eg, subcutaneous emphysema), followed by plain thoracic and cervical radiographs. If needed, contrast esophagography or computed tomographic (CT) scanning may be obtained to confirm the diagnosis or to look for intrathoracic and intra-abdominal collections that require drainage. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Because delays in diagnosis are associated with higher complication and mortality rates, early diagnosis is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. As an example, in a summary of 390 patients from 11 series, the overall mortality rate for patients who did not receive treatment within 24 hours was 27 percent (range 0 to 46 percent), whereas it was 14 percent (range 0 to 28 percent) for patients who were treated within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150633334\"><span class=\"h3\">Thoracic and cervical radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a suspected perforation should undergo thoracic and cervical radiographs (posterior-anterior and lateral films). In addition, if an intra-abdominal perforation is suspected, upright abdominal films should be obtained. Radiographic evidence of emphysema is found subcutaneously in the neck in approximately 95 percent of patients with cervical perforations, and in the mediastinum in approximately 40 percent of patients with intrathoracic perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Other findings suggestive of an esophageal perforation include pleural effusions, mediastinal widening, hydrothorax, hydropneumothorax, or subdiaphragmatic air. Mediastinal emphysema may not become visible radiographically for an hour, and pleural effusions and mediastinal widening may take several hours to develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150633349\"><span class=\"h3\">Contrast esophagography (Gastrografin or barium swallow)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast esophagography usually establishes the diagnosis. The sensitivity of contrast studies depends upon the size and location of the perforation, and the technique used for the study. The studies should be carried out with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In many centers, water-soluble contrast agents (eg, Gastrografin) are used initially. Esophagography with water-soluble contrast will show extravasation on radiograph in 50 percent of patients with cervical perforations and 75 to 80 of patient with thoracic perforations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71821\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71821 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Water-soluble contrast must be used with care in patients at risk for aspiration, as it can cause severe pneumonitis. In such patients, dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> is preferred as the initial contrast agent. In addition, water-soluble contrast should not be used in patients with known or suspected fistulas between the esophagus and the respiratory tract or if respiratory tract perforation is suspected.</p><p>If the water-soluble contrast study is negative, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> study should be performed. Barium studies will detect 60 percent of cervical perforations and 90 percent of intrathoracic perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>]. Although barium is superior to water-soluble contrast for demonstrating small perforations, it causes an inflammatory response in mediastinal or pleural cavities and is therefore not used as the primary diagnostic study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150633364\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If clinical suspicion remains high despite negative findings on esophageal contrast studies, or if contrast studies cannot be obtained, CT scanning should be performed. A CT scan is highly sensitive for detecting extravasated air in soft tissues adjacent to the esophagus or in the mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Other findings on CT scan may include esophageal wall thickening, pleural effusions, or periesophageal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. We agree with the recommendation of some authors that all patients with an esophageal perforation undergo CT scanning to look for intrathoracic and intra-abdominal fluid collections that would require drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154482778\"><span class=\"h3\">Flexible upper endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper endoscopy is generally not used to diagnose a perforation following esophageal dilation (though it may be used in other settings where esophageal perforation is suspected, such as penetrating trauma). Air insufflated during endoscopy may dissect intramurally and cause cervical subcutaneous emphysema. This in turn could suggest a more serious perforation than what is actually present and may result in surgery in a patient who could have been managed medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, upper endoscopy may be employed as part of the treatment for the perforation (see <a href=\"#H27673437\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic management'</a> below).</p><p>If a perforation is clearly seen at the time of the index endoscopy, radiographic imaging should still be obtained to assess the extent of the <span class=\"nowrap\">perforation/leak,</span> or if endoscopic therapy is performed at the time of the perforation, to assess closure of the defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27673362\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of patients with esophageal perforation following esophageal dilation depends upon the severity of the perforation and the elapsed time between the perforation and its diagnosis. Management options include medical management, endoscopic therapy, and surgery.</p><p>Patients whose perforations are recognized early have a good prognosis and, in many cases, can be managed nonsurgically. By contrast, a delay in diagnosis (particularly beyond 24 hours) usually leads to the need for surgical intervention and is associated with a mortality rate as high as 25 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/33,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,37</a>].</p><p>The goals of management are to prevent

management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the mortality rate associated with esophageal perforation is high, intensive care unit admission should be considered not only for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise, but also for patients with multiple comorbid conditions.</p><p>Regardless of what management approach is chosen (medical, endoscopic, or

Multiple series have described the successful use of stents for esophageal perforations, though no large trials have been carried out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/48-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-54</a>]. In one series, 33 patients (19 of whom had an iatrogenic perforation) underwent stenting with removable stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The stent sealed the lesion in 32 patients (97 percent). Stent extractions were uncomplicated in all 23 patients who had their stents removed within six weeks. Ten patients had their stents removed between 6 and 84 weeks after placement. In that group, there were six extraction-related complications. Ultimately, four patients (12 percent) required an esophageal resection. In three it was due to failed stent therapy, and in one it was due to failed stent removal.</p><p>If an esophageal stent is used, a repeat esophagram should be obtained in one to two days to document that the perforation has sealed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Once confirmed, the patient may resume oral intake (typically clear liquids to start, with advancement of the diet as tolerated).

Stents are often removed six to eight weeks following insertion, but the longer the stent is left in place, the more likely that granulation tissue may develop that may make stent removal difficult. There are reports of removal in as few as 10 to 21 days with complete healing of the perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation/abstract/47,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49,50</a>].

The incidence of perforation is influenced by the etiology of the stricture, the experience of the endoscopist, and the techniques and equipment used. In general, perforation rates associated with esophageal stricture dilation are low (one to two per thousand). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of esophageal perforation may include neck, chest, or back pain, hoarseness, dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspnea, hematemesis, subcutaneous emphysema, and symptoms of an acute abdomen. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of an esophageal perforation is based upon recognition of the clinical features and radiographic evaluation. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who develop significant neck, chest, or abdominal pain following endoscopy. Generally, the evaluation starts with plain thoracic and cervical radiographs. If needed, contrast esophagography or computed tomographic (CT) scanning may be obtained to confirm the diagnosis or to look for intrathoracic and intra-abdominal collections that require drainage. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with esophageal perforation following esophageal dilation depends upon the severity of the perforation and the elapsed time between the perforation and its diagnosis. Management options include medical management, endoscopic therapy, and surgery. (See <a href=\"#H27673362\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Regardless of what management approach is chosen, all patients with an esophageal perforation require the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoidance of all oral intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nutritional support, typically parenteral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticarcillin-and-clavulanate-potassium-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticarcillin-clavulanate</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intravenous proton pump inhibitor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drainage of fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">collections/debridement</span> of infected and necrotic tissue if present</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain is sometimes observed following stricture dilation, even in patients without a perforation.
