The goal is to define the mechanism of the arrhythmia to help determine therapy and prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To determine the site of block in patients with abnormal atrioventricular conduction when clinical and electrocardiographic information fail to help localize the site of block. Rare cases of AV conduction abnormalities may be due to concealed junctional beats that can only be demonstrated through an invasive EP study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk stratification indications:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the primary prevention of SCD, patients with an ischemic cardiomyopathy due to a prior myocardial infarction and who have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent should undergo ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring. EP studies are indicated if they are found to have nonsustained VT. The induction of sustained VT or VF constitutes a class I indication for the implantation of an ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities below the level of the AV node may progress to complete AV block with catastrophic consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The site of block in patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block is infranodal (intra- or infra-Hisian), and this constitutes an indication for pacing even if the patient is asymptomatic. An EP study is indicated if the site of block cannot be determined reliably in an asymptomatic individual with second degree AV block. If the site is infranodal, pacing is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymptomatic young (8 to 21 years) patients with electrocardiographic manifestations of preexcitation may be at high risk of SCD due to atrial fibrillation progressing to VF. These patients are advised to undergo exercise stress testing. The clear and sudden loss of preexcitation with exercise stress testing predicts a favorable prognosis. If clear loss of preexcitation is not seen or the data are uninterpretable, invasive risk stratification via transesophageal pacing or EP studies is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Programmed electrical stimulation for risk stratification of a manifest accessory bypass tract is a class I indication in a symptomatic patient and a class IIa indication in an asymptomatic patient if the noninvasive measures described cannot be met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The role of EP studies in the Brugada syndrome is controversial. Patients with the Brugada syndrome who have had a history of syncope or have survived SCD are more likely to be inducible. However, the role of EP studies in predicting future events is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The implantation of an ICD may be considered in a patient with Brugada syndrome who is induced into VF<em>. </em>One study analyzed the role of clinical factors and programmed ventricular stimulation in determining the risk of arrhythmic events in patients with the Brugada syndrome. The investigators concluded that clinical factors such as syncope and spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern and the induction of ventricular arrhythmias by programmed ventricular stimulation all portend a higher risk of events. The value of programmed ventricular stimulation was greater if ventricular arrhythmias were induced with single or double extrastimuli. A negative study did not predict arrhythmia-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Professional society guidelines allow the use of invasive programmed electrical stimulation with one to two premature ventricular extrastimuli for risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with class I Brugada pattern (class IIb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<em> </em>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Prognosis, management, and approach to screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For purposes of risk stratification for SCD, programmed electrical stimulation can be considered (a class IIa indication) in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and an LVEF &gt;35 percent despite optimal medical therapy and immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For purposes of risk stratification for SCD, programmed electrical stimulation is occasionally used in asymptomatic patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].

Adult patients with congenital heart disease of moderate to severe complexity who display high-risk features such as syncope and ventricular arrhythmias should undergo invasive EP studies to determine if they are at risk of SCD and may benefit from an ICD (class IIa indication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients with documented tachyarrhythmias in whom the decision was made to undergo catheter ablation will automatically undergo a diagnostic EP study, usually directed at the putative tachyarrhythmia, before catheter ablation is performed. The purpose of this EP study is to define the diagnosis and localize the pathway responsible for the arrhythmia. In the pediatric population, the role of programmed electrical stimulation is limited and is not expected to confer value beyond what has already been collected noninvasively. While a diagnostic EP study is employed in conjunction with a preplanned catheter ablation for a documented arrhythmia, it is rarely used to risk stratify patients with nonsustained polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias or to define endocardial scar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, EP studies suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity. The significance of the findings is often determined by the underlying cardiac disease and the patient's clinical presentation. For example, the induction of sustained monomorphic VT with double ventricular extrastimuli in a patient with a history of a myocardial infarction presenting with a wide complex tachycardia is both highly sensitive and specific. On the other hand, the specificity of inducing polymorphic VT of VF in patients with no or minimal cardiac disease presenting with syncope is very limited. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518703640\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute contraindications to EP study include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable angina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia or septicemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute decompensated congestive heart failure not caused by the arrhythmia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major bleeding diathesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute lower extremity venous thrombosis if femoral vein cannulation is desired</p><p/><p>It would also be important to realize that the value of EP studies is greatest in patients who are suspected of having a tachyarrhythmia whose mechanism is reentry.

Additional evaluation prior to the procedure in select patients may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Event monitoring for up to four weeks in an effort to document the tachycardia. Event monitoring for longer periods is typically more useful than short-term (24 to 48 hours) Holter monitoring in documenting the tachycardia.

In addition to the electrophysiologist, several other staff members are required. Intravenous conscious sedation is typically used to ensure patient comfort, although in some situations (ie, prolonged catheter ablation procedures) general anesthesia can be used. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG) leads are applied to the patient, as well as &quot;hands-off&quot; defibrillation pads. Arterial pressure may be monitored invasively or noninvasively, depending upon the complexity of the procedure. Oxygen saturation, as well as in some cases end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, is monitored.</p><p>The following are considered part of the routine preparation and monitoring involved in invasive EP studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be fasting after midnight on the day of the procedure, except for oral medications with sips of water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should hold their normal cardiovascular medications, particularly medications which affect atrioventricular (AV) node conduction (ie, beta blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>) and antiarrhythmic medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 2</a>).

The Seldinger technique is employed to place multiple venous accesses. The femoral approach is most common, but the subclavian, internal jugular, or brachial approach may be used, most often for placement of a catheter in the coronary sinus.</p><p>Multipolar electrode catheters are positioned in the heart.

Left heart access may be obtained via either a transseptal or retrograde aortic approach. Intracardiac recordings and programmed electrical stimulation (PES) are performed via the electrode catheters. Typically, for evaluation of ventricular arrhythmias requiring LV mapping, a retrograde aortic approach is employed, while the transseptal approach is preferred for left-sided SVTs. Either approach may be used for patients with a suspected left-sided accessory pathway.</p><p>When catheters are placed into left-sided cardiac chambers, systemic anticoagulation is required to prevent thromboembolic complications. Typically intravenous heparin is initiated at the time of the procedure and continued until the catheters are removed from the left-sided cardiac chambers.</p><p>At the conclusion of the procedure, the access sheaths are pulled and hemostasis is achieved using manual or mechanical pressure or a vascular closure device. The patient is generally kept on bed rest for four to six more hours to ensure adequate hemostasis has been achieved.

The intracardiac electrograms are generally displayed in the order of normal cardiac activation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64875\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64875 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first intracardiac tracing is a recording from the high right atrium (HRA) close to the sinus node. Pacing at this position allows evaluation of sinoatrial node function and atrioventricular (AV) conduction; the addition of premature atrial stimulation or burst atrial pacing may result in the induction of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Sinus node function is determined by measuring the sinus node recovery time (SNRT), a reflection of the node's automaticity, and the sinoatrial conduction time (SACT), a reflection of peri-sinus node conduction properties. Great care must be exercised in interpreting the findings from EP studies due to limited sensitivity and specificity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The next intracardiac tracing is the His bundle recording (HBE), obtained from a catheter positioned at the bundle of His (in the area of the tricuspid annulus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One to three recordings may be obtained from the coronary sinus (CS) in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias or preexcitation.

This measurement reflects conduction time through the distal His-Purkinje system. Unlike the AV node, the His-Purkinje system is far less influenced by the autonomic nervous system, and the range in normal subjects is narrow (35 to 55 milliseconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>A prolonged HV interval is consistent with diseased distal conduction in all fascicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

This is performed by ventricular extrastimulus and incremental ventricular pacing. Absence of VA conduction makes certain SVTs less likely (ie, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia) and suggests an atrial tachycardia (AT), since AT is independent of retrograde VA conduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16674758\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinoatrial conduction time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual method of calculating sinoatrial conduction time (SACT), which is a measure of sinus node function, is an indirect measure. This approach involves the placement of a catheter in the superior aspect of the right atrium approximating the main intrinsic pacemaker site of the SA node. Progressively premature atrial extrastimuli are introduced by way of that catheter after every eighth to tenth beat of either a stable sinus rhythm (Strauss method) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] or atrial pacing (Narula method) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Due to the limitations of indirect methods in assessing the SACT, techniques for direct recording of the sinus electrogram (EGM) have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>]. Endocardial recordings demonstrate diastolic phase 4 activity followed by a slow upstroke culminating in a rapid atrial EGM. The directly measured SACT was defined as the interval between the local EGM and the rapid atrial deflection. </p><p>Normal SACT times generally range from 40 to 150 milliseconds, depending upon the laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Studies have shown a good correlation between indirect and direct methods of measuring SACT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/35,37,38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37,38,41</a>].

This is repeated at progressively shorter cycle lengths. Pacing rates up to 200 beats per minute may be employed for improved sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. It is important to wait at least one minute between pacing sequences to allow full recovery of the SN. Confirmation that the escape beat is sinus by examining P-wave morphology and atrial activation sequence is essential to exclude a shift in pacemaker site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The maximum SNRT is the longest pause from the last pacing stimulus to the first spontaneously occurring sinus beat at any paced cycle length. As the sinus cycle length (SCL) affects the SNRT, it is often normalized or corrected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SNRT is normalized by dividing this value by the SCL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) is determined by subtracting the SCL from the SNRT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58763\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef58763 \">waveform 3</a>).</p><p/><p>A total recovery time (TRT) can also be calculated, which is the time required to return to the basal sinus rate.</p><p>Normal values have generally been estimated as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">SNRT/SCL</span> &lt;150 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSNRT &lt;550 milliseconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TRT less than five seconds</p><p/><p>There are several limitations to the use of overdrive suppression in determining SN function, which include changes in autonomic tone due to the effects of pacing, changes in P-wave morphology or atrial activation suggesting a pacemaker shift, sinoatrial entrance block, and secondary pauses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGRAMMED ELECTRICAL STIMULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After baseline measurements are recorded, pacing is performed via the intracardiac electrode catheters. Burst pacing at various fixed cycle lengths as well as programmed electrical stimulation (PES) is administered. With PES, a number of stimuli at a fixed cycle length are delivered (eg, eight beats at a rate of 100 beats per minute), followed by a premature beat. The coupling interval of the premature beat is progressively shortened until the refractory period of the tissue being paced is reached. Multiple premature stimuli can be introduced.</p><p>The technique of PES is used to assess the atrioventricular (AV) conducting system and to induce supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Premature beats can be introduced during a tachyarrhythmia to probe the mechanism of the tachycardia.</p><p>Programmed atrial stimulation is usually from the high right atrium, although a second atrial site such as coronary sinus pacing is also employed in certain situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81938%7ECARD%2F58120\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef81938 graphicRef58120 \">waveform 4A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. One or sometimes two atrial extrastimuli with progressively shorter coupling intervals are delivered following a train of eight or more drive beats at several cycle lengths until atrial refractoriness is encountered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Incremental atrial pacing in steps of 10 milliseconds is also performed until second degree AV block develops.</p><p>Programmed atrial extrastimuli can be used to determine the effective refractory period of the His-Purkinje system (HPS), which should be &lt;450 milliseconds. However, the response of refractory periods to pacing may reveal severe HPS disease. As the refractory period of the HPS should shorten with the cycle length, an increasing refractory period with shorter cycle lengths indicates abnormal HPS conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27341871\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS USED FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES DURING EPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of pharmacologic agents may be of help in certain settings.

Cardiac mapping refers to careful movement of a mapping or ablation catheter in the area of interest, probing for the site at which radiofrequency ablation will be successful at curing the arrhythmia. Cardiac mapping during EP testing identifies the temporal and spatial distributions of electrical potentials generated by the myocardium during normal and abnormal rhythms. This process allows description of the spread of activation from its initiation to its completion within a region of interest and, in its usual application, is focused toward the identification of the site of origin or a critical site of conduction for an arrhythmia. Multiple techniques for mapping have been developed.

Serious complications of these procedures are generally related to the catheterization process itself, including vascular injury, tricuspid valve damage, pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage requiring transfusion therapy, cardiac chamber perforation resulting in pericardial tamponade, sepsis from catheterization site abscess, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63157 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>The induction of serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurs frequently during diagnostic EP testing. Such arrhythmias can usually be promptly terminated, either by overdrive pacing or external defibrillation. However, if the arrhythmia is difficult to revert and is of long duration, there may be complications related to the prolonged hypotension and, rarely, sudden death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications with concomitant catheter ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter-based radiofrequency (RF) ablation procedures are typically much longer studies with more radiation exposure, administration of higher doses of sedative and analgesic agents, more frequent catheterization of the left heart, and more frequent change of catheters. The duration of some of the RF ablation procedures may raise morbidity from vascular complications, thromboembolic complications, cardiac chamber rupture, or radiation exposure including skin injuries and a possible increased risk for malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63157 \">table 3</a>).
