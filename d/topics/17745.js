Lipid lowering drug therapy, particularly with statins, is indicated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in most individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and in many who are at high risk.

These agents include nicotinic acid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">niacin</a>), bile acid sequestrants, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> and their use is discussed elsewhere.

LDL apheresis, which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, has been recommended by some experts for these individuals. Patients who might be potential candidates include: those with coronary artery disease (CAD) and LDL-cholesterol levels greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> after standard therapy; and those without established CAD, but at high risk due to an LDL-cholesterol level greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl</span> after dietary and pharmacologic intervention, particularly those who have additional risk such as first-degree relatives with premature CAD, high lipoprotein (a), or high-risk medical condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Individuals with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) usually are treated with LDL apheresis. We believe that clinical judgment plays an important role in the decision to use this burdensome therapy in these patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein(a) and cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325436636\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LDL apheresis refers to the extracorporeal removal of circulating apo B-containing lipoproteins, including LDL, lipoprotein (a), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). There are multiple apheresis methods, including dextran sulphate cellulose adsorption, heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL cholesterol precipitation, immunoadsorption, and double filtration plasma pheresis of lipoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The procedure is performed weekly or biweekly, determined in part by the rate at which LDL levels return to baseline after therapy. It is available at a limited number of centers and cost is in the range of 3000 to 4000 United States dollars per session. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325436643\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy and safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LDL apheresis lowers LDL-C acutely by 50 to 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, the time averaged exposure to LDL-C is more likely a better measure of efficacy than the single post-treatment value. This number is calculated using multiple between treatment values. While the optimal time-averaged LDL-C reduction is not known, a 30 percent reduction after six months and 38 percent after 18 months in the absence of statin therapy has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with higher baseline lipid levels appear to have a relatively greater response to this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The range of time for return to baseline level of LDL-C varies between four days and three to four weeks. </p><p>The most frequent side effects include hypotension, anemia, nausea, flushing, and headache. Venous access is necessary and many patients require construction of an arteriovenous fistula or placement of a central venous port, which increases the long-term complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Some studies, which are limited by multiple potential sources of bias, the use of suboptimal doses of statins, or the enrollment of small numbers of patients, have suggested evidence of benefit for outcomes such as myocardial infarction. For example, in an observational study of 130 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who were treated with either LDL apheresis plus statin therapy (n = 43) or statin therapy (n = 87), there was a significantly lower rate of total coronary events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, and death from coronary heart disease) in the LDL apheresis group (10 versus 36 percent, respectively) at six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>At least eight studies that evaluated angiographic parameters have evaluated the ability of LDL apheresis to reverse or delay the progression of atherosclerosis. Most of the patients in these studies had heterozygous FH; a few were homozygotes. Six of these studies were observational and in the aggregate did not show convincing evidence of regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

At two years, the mean reduction in LDL cholesterol was 63 and 47 percent, respectively. There was no difference in the degree of coronary atherosclerosis between the two groups. Repeat angiography at about two years revealed no difference within or between the two groups in the degree of coronary atherosclerosis, although more minor lesions disappeared in the apheresis group. LAARS also noted an improvement in regional myocardial perfusion in patients treated with apheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] while another report showed improved endothelial function after a single apheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Traditional coronary angiography is a relatively blunt outcome measure; several studies have demonstrated improvement in the following cardiovascular effects of LDL apheresis: endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], coronary vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], microvascular flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>]. </p><p>The literature contains a number of case reports of children with homozygous FH undergoing LDL apheresis, many of whom had regression of xanthomata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

There were no cardiac deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, or coronary revascularization procedures.

Benefit is likely to be greatest when an individual will be or has been exposed to very high LDL-C for many years; this can be thought of as the lifetime risk. We refer very few adult patients with <strong>heterozygous</strong> FH for the procedure (and no children). We think it is reasonable to consider LDL apheresis in <strong>homozygotes </strong>or those with analogous phenotypes such as compound heterozygotes <strong>if the patient fails to reach the following LDL-C targets with diet and pharmacotherapy</strong>: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL-C &ge;160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in children (age less than 18 years) with established atherosclerotic CVD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL-C &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in children without established atherosclerotic CVD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL-C &ge;160 to 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in adults with established CVD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL-C &ge;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in adults without established CVD. A recommendation for the use of LDL-apheresis in these individuals should take into account not only the absolute LDL-C level, but also the presence or absence of other cardiovascular risk factors as well as the age of the patient. We consider recommending the procedure for younger individuals and other risk factors with an LDL-C of 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or higher, whereas our threshold for such a recommendation would be significantly higher for a patient without other risk factors or who was older than 50 years. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5093064\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations of others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2016 European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/European</span> Atherosclerosis Society Guideline for the management of dyslipidemias recommends LDL apheresis for those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The Third Report of the National (United States) Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) Final Report did not discuss LDL apheresis, in part because they were not intended to address patients with severe hypercholesterolemia associated with defined genetic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The 2011 Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents makes the following statement: &ldquo;Children with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and extremely elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> have undergone effective LDL lowering therapy with biweekly LDL apheresis under the care of lipid specialists in academic medical centers&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The National Lipid Associated Expert Panel on FH list the following as possible indications for LDL apheresis in patients who, after six months, do not have an adequate response to maximum tolerated drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional homozygous FH patients with LDL-C &ge;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (or non-HDL cholesterol 330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional heterozygous FH patients with LDL-C &ge;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (or non-HDL cholesterol 330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and 0 to 1 risk factors).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional heterozygous FH patients with LDL-C &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (or non-HDL cholesterol 230 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and high-risk characteristics such as &ge;2 risk factors or high lipoprotein (a) &ge;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> using an isoform insensitive assay.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional heterozygous FH patients with LDL-C &ge;160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (or non-HDL cholesterol 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and very high-risk characteristics such as established coronary heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, or diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PARTIAL ILEAL BYPASS SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of partial ileal bypass surgery was best assessed in the POSCH trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].
