Esophageal varices often happen in people with serious liver disease, called &quot;cirrhosis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580098\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of esophageal varices?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal varices do not cause symptoms until they leak or burst. This causes bleeding, which can be very serious. Signs of bleeding from esophageal varices include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark-colored or black bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody bowel movements or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling lightheaded</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p>If you have liver disease and get one of more of these symptoms, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. Do not drive yourself to the hospital or have another person drive you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580113\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for esophageal varices?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. All people who have cirrhosis should have a test called an &quot;upper endoscopy&quot; to check for esophageal varices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>For an upper endoscopy, the doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into your mouth down your throat and into your esophagus. The tube (called an endoscope) has a camera and a light on it. This allows the doctor to see inside your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your intestine.</p><p>Sometimes, doctors do an endoscopy using a small capsule with a tiny camera inside. You swallow the capsule while lying on your right side and sip water every 30 seconds. The capsule sends photos of the lining of your esophagus and stomach to a device outside your body. A doctor then looks for any problems in the photos.</p><p>If you have cirrhosis, you should have an upper endoscopy every 1 to 3 years. The doctor will check to see if you have new varices or if the ones you have are getting larger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580128\"><span class=\"h1\">How are esophageal varices treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments that can make varices less likely to bleed include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines called beta-blockers &ndash; These are also used to treat high blood pressure. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">propranolol</a> (brand name: Inderal) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nadolol</a> (brand name: Corgard).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, if you are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding alcohol</p><p/><p>If you have had bleeding from varices or are likely to have bleeding, your doctor can do a procedure during an endoscopy called &quot;variceal band ligation.&quot; This means that the doctor will place small rubber bands around the varices to prevent bleeding. You will need to take medicines that lower the amount of acid in your stomach while the varices heal. Your doctor will tell you what medicine to take. Some of the medicines are available over-the-counter and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Omeprazole</a> (sample brand name: Prilosec)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Esomeprazole</a> (sample brand name: Nexium)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Lansoprazole</a> (sample brand name: Prevacid)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Pantoprazole</a> (sample brand name: Protonix)</p><p/><p>Variceal band ligation has to be repeated every 2 to 8 weeks until the varices are gone. Rarely, people who have severe bleeding need to have a procedure called a &quot;TIPS.&quot; For this procedure, a doctor inserts a thin tube through a vein in the neck and places the tube inside the liver. The tube helps blood to flow through the liver more easily. This lowers the blood pressure in the varices and helps stop bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580143\"><span class=\"h1\">Can esophageal varices be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treating the underlying liver disease that caused the cirrhosis might help prevent varices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580158\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-varices-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Esophageal varices (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
