Not only are different types of scales needed for these different purposes, but no single scale is suitable for capturing all of the effects of stroke.</p><p>This topic will review stroke scales and grading systems that are used for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Grading systems used to classify patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subarachnoid-hemorrhage-grading-scales\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subarachnoid hemorrhage grading scales&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Categorization systems used in the classification and etiology of stroke are discussed elsewhere.

There has been considerable progress in the clinimetrics of stroke since the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although there are numerous general and stroke-specific scales that have established reliability and validity, no single scale is suitable for all clinical or research situations.</p><p>The International Classification of Functioning and Disability and Health, developed by the World Health Organization, categorizes the impact of disease into to three dimensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body Dimension, referring to the structure and function of body systems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activities Dimension, referring to the complete range of activities performed by an individual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation Dimension, classifying areas of life in which an individual is involved, has access to, has societal opportunities or barriers</p><p/><p>These three general dimensions correspond to what clinicians might describe as neurologic impairments (ie, deficits such as a hemianopsia, aphasia, limb paresis, gait imbalance, or sensory loss), disabilities (ie, loss of the ability to perform daily tasks, such as eating, dressing, and bathing, resulting from physiological deficits), and handicaps (ie, the impact of deficits and disabilities on social participation such as employment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly important to assess the effects of disease and treatment on quality of life.</p><p>Although the impact of stroke as reflected by these different domains is generally consistent, it is important to measure each domain, as focusing on any one could be misleading. As an example, consider a patient with a paralyzed hand. This deficit would be measured in the Body Dimension as a motor impairment. By the use of compensatory strategies such as the use of the unimpaired hand or prosthetics, that same patient might have no disability (ie, able to eat, dress, bathe). If he was a truck driver, he might be able to return to work by driving a modified vehicle (no handicap), whereas if he was a watchmaker, he might be unable to return to his previous employment (ie, a social handicap). Thus, the impact of a neurologic impairment on quality of life can be quite different depending on individual circumstances.</p><p>In addition, a stroke considered to be mild based upon a measure of one dimension may be severe when measured on a different dimension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A homonymous inferior quadrantanopia might represent a minimal impairment and result in no disability, but would be an important handicap and have a large impact on quality of life because driving a motor vehicle is precluded. Therefore, when choosing a stroke scale, one must first consider why it is being used and what it is measuring.</p><p>In addition to assessing stroke severity as an index of outcome, different types of stroke scales can be used for a variety of other purposes. Diagnostically, the rapid identification of possible stroke by emergency services personnel is facilitated by the use of stroke scales designed for that purpose. Stroke severity as assessed with an impairment-level scale such as the National Institutes for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) may be useful when discussing the bleeding risk associated with thrombolytic therapy with an individual patient or family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, the NIHSS score is part of the assessment that determines whether a patient is a candidate for intravenous thrombolysis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> between 3 and 4.5 hours of symptom onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-thrombolytic-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke-therapeutic-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke: Therapeutic use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stroke prognosis is largely determined by the severity of the patient's initial impairments, and several schemes have been developed to provide an estimate of functional outcome to help guide decisions such as discharge location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A plethora of stroke scales have been developed for each of these purposes as discussed in the sections that follow. A general stroke related outcome measure that incorporates some of the properties of individual scales has been proposed (American Heart Association Stroke Outcome Classification), but has not yet been adopted for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24273487\"><span class=\"h1\">STROKE DIAGNOSTIC SCALES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of poor recognition of stroke symptoms, stroke scales and grading systems have been developed both to aid the general public and emergency responders in the identification of persons with acute stroke, and to hasten transport of stroke victims to appropriate medical facilities. These tools must be simple and rapidly applicable.</p><p>The best studied scales for stroke diagnosis are the Face Arm Speech Test (FAST), the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS), the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS), and the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER). The FAST and CPSS are similar, with each evaluating the presence or absence of facial weakness, arm weakness, and speech difficulty. The main difference between the two is that FAST incorporates assessment of language function during normal conversation, whereas CPSS tests language by asking the patient to repeat a short sentence. The LAPSS<strong> </strong>and ROSIER scales incorporate additional items to help exclude stroke mimics and to increase sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24273494\"><span class=\"h2\">Face Arm Speech Test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Face Arm Speech Test (FAST; the &quot;T&quot; is a reminder of the importance of time and the need to reach a hospital immediately)<strong> </strong>evaluates patients with suspected stroke by assessing them for the presence of a speech impairment, facial weakness, and arm weakness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54134 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In a prospective report evaluating the CPSS, the diagnostic accuracy for emergency department physicians compared with non-physician emergency medical personnel was similar with high correlation for total score between these groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The presence of an abnormality on any one of the three stroke scale items was associated with a marked increase in the likelihood of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
