The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 7.1 percent of abortions were performed between 14 to 20 weeks and 1.3 percent at or after 21 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The most common surgical technique for second-trimester termination in the United States is dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E), and will be the focus of this topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Other surgical approaches include intact D&amp;E, which is a variant of D&amp;E, and hysterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hysterotomy is rarely used except when it is unsafe to dilate the cervix or induce labor, or when there is no trained D&amp;E provider.

This is a process of softening and dilating the cervix prior to the procedure to minimize cervical trauma by avoiding the need for extensive mechanical dilation on the day of the procedure. Rapid mechanical dilation is a risk factor for cervical insufficiency and may result in future second-trimester pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Osmotic dilators (ie, laminaria or synthetic osmotic dilators [Dilapan-S]) are the standard method of cervical preparation. In cases in which osmotic dilation alone is not sufficient, dilators may be used in combination with a pharmacologic agent, typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113311901\"><span class=\"h3\">Osmotic dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osmotic dilators absorb moisture and thus gradually expand within the cervical canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69543 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87446 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87447 \">picture 2</a>). They are placed one to two days prior to the procedure. In a two-day dilation, on the second day, the dilators are removed and larger diameter or more numerous dilators are placed on the second day. Some authors utilize Dilapan-S either alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> the same day as second-trimester procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Osmotic dilators'</a>.)</p><p>In general, osmotic dilators are the mainstay of cervical preparation. High-quality evidence demonstrates that when only one method of cervical preparation is used, osmotic dilators are the most effective method. The efficacy of osmotic dilators compared with prostaglandins was illustrated in a meta-analysis of randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Based upon data from two trials, use of osmotic dilators compared with prostaglandins (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>) resulted in an average of 3.6 mm greater dilation and in a significantly decreased rate of a need for further mechanical dilation (17 versus 85 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.07, 95% CI 0.03-0.17) and of difficult mechanical dilation (3 versus 23 percent; OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.06-0.47). This analysis was limited by the small number of trials and number of participants in each trial. These studies were not large enough to detect differences in infrequent complications, such as cervical laceration or uterine perforation.</p><p>The disadvantage of osmotic dilators is that to achieve maximal dilation they often must be placed one or two days prior to the procedure and often are placed over two days (with an additional visit to place a larger set of dilators on the second day) prior to the procedure, although same-day options are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> can be given the same day as the procedure, allowing for the procedure to be completed in one day. This decreases the expense of second-trimester abortion and increases access for many patients.</p><p>Types of osmotic dilators (ie, laminaria, synthetic osmotic dilators [Dilapan-S]) and the techniques for insertion are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Osmotic dilators'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113311907\"><span class=\"h3\">Dilators with misoprostol or mifepristone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osmotic dilators alone may not be sufficient at later gestational ages or in women in whom dilation is not proceeding effectively or difficult dilation is anticipated. In these patients, a combination of an osmotic dilator and a pharmacologic agent is the preferred approach. Based on the available evidence reviewed below, our approach is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing second-trimester surgical abortion at &gt;16 weeks of gestation, if a single method of cervical preparation is used, we recommend osmotic dilators rather than a pharmacologic agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, for women in whom osmotic dilation alone is not sufficient, we suggest that osmotic dilators be used <strong>with</strong> a pharmacologic agent rather than osmotic dilators alone. For use as an adjunct to osmotic dilators, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>. The need for mifepristone is determined by the clinician at the time they are placed based on the difficulty of placing the dilators. Patients at risk for difficult dilation include those with the following characteristics: prior cervical conization, lower segment fibroids, prior cervical infection, or a known history of cervical stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> as an adjunct to osmotic dilators for patients with the following characteristics: (1) &ge;20 weeks of gestation in whom we are unable to place an adequate number of osmotic dilators during the first dilator placement, or (2) any other patient at &ge;20 weeks in whom we anticipate difficult dilation based on the size of the gestation and the surgeon's subjective assessment of the cervix at time of dilator placement. We administer mifepristone 200 mg orally 24 hours before dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E). Mifepristone often permits placement of fewer dilators without compromising cervical dilation. We had previously used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> as an adjunctive medication, but based upon data (reviewed below) and our experience on efficacy and tolerability, we now use mifepristone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing second-trimester surgical abortion at &le;16 weeks of gestation, same-day cervical preparation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> alone or Dilapin-S alone are reasonable options, appropriate for women who do not have risk factors for cervical stenosis. Overnight osmotic dilators alone is also a reasonable option. Routine use of adjunctive misoprostol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> combined with osmotic dilators is not necessary. There is no consensus on dose, route, and timing of misoprostol before second-trimester abortion at &lt;16 weeks of gestation. One common regimen uses 400 micrograms vaginally three hours preceding surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We use the gestational age threshold of 16 weeks because there are few data for use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> alone for cervical preparation at later gestational ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p>The United States Society of Family Planning (SFP) guidelines are consistent with our recommendations.

The advantages of this practice are that feticidal injection precludes the possibility of live birth, thereby potentially reducing emotional stress on the patient, and also allowing the surgeon to minimize concerns regarding compliance with legislation that penalizes uterine evacuation in which portions of the fetus are removed prior to demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, it has been proposed that fetal demise makes the procedure technically easier by inducing fetal maceration and cervical priming, but this has not been scientifically demonstrated. Many clinicians use such injections before all second-trimester surgical abortions, while others use them only in those cases in which they consider this to have a benefit for the patient.</p><p>The benefits of feticidal injection to the patient remain unproven. Two randomized trials arrived at conflicting results regarding whether injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> prior to D&amp;E resulted in an increased rate of extramural birth (spontaneous delivery of the fetus prior to the procedure) or an increased risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Extramural birth sometimes occurs prior to demise, and this, along with the unplanned nature of this event, may potentially cause distress to the patient. In addition, feticidal injection has been associated with an increased rate of nausea or pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Some experts have questioned the ethics of adding this invasive procedure with potential risks and unproven benefits, particularly if performed principally to fulfill a legal requirement.</p><p>Given the available data and other considerations, for most women undergoing second-trimester D&amp;E, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using feticidal injection.

Alternatives include using a side-open speculum that provides additional space for extraction, doing the procedure without a speculum (using care to visualize the cervix with each pass of the forceps) or using a short-bladed speculum (eg, Klopfer speculum). We routinely use a Klopfer speculum because a long speculum (Pederson, Graves) limits the degree of freedom in the arc of movement of long instruments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H441157947\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the diameter of most forceps used for D&amp;E, the minimum dilation required ranges from 14 to 19 mm (42 to 57 French) and depends on gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Procedures that require use of large forceps should be performed by an experienced surgeon.</p><p>Techniques that facilitate the procedure and help to avoid complications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound guidance can provide information about the uterine anatomy and the location of fetal parts. This may facilitate technically challenging extractions and may decrease the risk of uterine perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Providers should consider using ultrasound in obese patients, patients with uterine anomalies, when training inexperienced providers, and in any case in which the provider experiences difficulty with evacuation. One study of over 4500 second-trimester surgical abortions found no increased risk of complications in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital examination of the uterine cavity can help to locate fetal parts, which helps to correctly place the extraction forceps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most surgeons find they have to open the extraction forceps wider than anticipated, particularly to encircle the calvaria of a later gestation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pregnant uterus curves somewhat anteriorly. Some forceps, such as the Hern, angle the jaws of the instrument anteriorly to help correct for the natural location of fetal parts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgeons must be very careful to avoid pushing fetal parts with the forceps since this may push them deeper into the fundus and even through the uterine wall, causing uterine perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetal parts should be brought down to the lower uterine segment for disarticulation.

Caution should be employed since bony spicules exposed during fetal disarticulation can perforate the uterine walls and abrade the cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach is to operate in the midline. More lateral placement of forceps may result in a lateral uterine perforation with potential involvement of the uterine vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgeons should attempt to reduce the number of passes of extraction forceps since this reduces the opportunity to perforate the uterus or abrade the cervix.

With the extraction forceps placed in the lower uterine cavity, the surgeon places his or her other hand on the patient's abdominal wall to localize the forceps in relation to fetal parts and to help prevent uterine perforation.</p><p/><p>Both the fetus and placenta must be entirely removed. Some surgeons prefer to remove the placenta after the fetus to avoid disruption of the placental bed, but this is not always possible. The placenta has a characteristic soft consistency that experienced surgeons can discern with extractors.</p><p>Following extraction of fetal and placental tissue, most surgeons finish the D&amp;E by curetting the uterine lining with a suction cannula. This permits removal of most of any remaining placental fragments. Some surgeons then perform a &quot;curette check,&quot; using a sharp curette to gently feel for any retained parts and confirm the texture of an empty uterus. In our experience, this maneuver is not necessary and has the potential to needlessly increase pain, as well as the risk of uterine perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78403710\"><span class=\"h3\">Intact dilation and evacuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variant of D&amp;E is intact D&amp;E.

After achieving sufficient cervical dilation with osmotic dilators, surgeons use extraction forceps to deliver a breech fetus until the calvaria is lodged above the internal os. The remainder of the fetus is delivered intact following decompression of the calvaria, often by suctioning intracranial contents. If the fetus is in vertex presentation, the surgeon can make an incision in the calvaria, suction intracranial contents, and collapse the calvaria with extraction forceps. The remainder of the fetus will subsequently deliver intact.</p><p>The potential advantages of intact D&amp;E compared with standard D&amp;E include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood of uterine perforation and cervical abrasion may be decreased because the technique minimizes the number of instrumental passes and permits direct visualization within the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the fetus is removed intact, it might also permit superior morphologic evaluation to further clarify prenatal diagnosis, although pathologic evaluation can also be performed on non-intact specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>The only study comparing intact D&amp;E with standard D&amp;E was a retrospective study of 383 women who underwent surgical abortion at &ge;20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There was no difference in estimated blood loss or operative duration between the intact extraction and disarticulation groups. The overall rate of complications was 5 percent in both groups. Three patients in the D&amp;E group required admission to a surgical intensive care unit (complications included amniotic fluid embolus, sepsis, pulmonary embolus, perforation of hysterotomy scar); however, there were insufficient data to detect a difference in the risk of major complications.</p><p>In the United States, the Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003 criminalizes some variants of D&amp;E and provides no legal exception for cases performed to protect maternal health.

The risk of perioperative hemorrhage increases with advancing gestational age and is most commonly the result of uterine atony.

The most important measure of complete evacuation is the clinical assessment of an experienced surgeon who has inspected evacuated products.</p><p>Pelvic ultrasound may also be helpful. This is particularly the case when clinicians evacuate anomalous pregnancies or pregnancies in which fetal demise results in substantial maceration of fetal anatomy. Unfortunately, small blood clots rapidly accumulate immediately after D&amp;E, which may obscure some fetal parts or mimic the appearance of a retained placenta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H441158333\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-trimester surgical abortion is a safe and effective procedure. Uterine evacuation is completed in a single procedure for most women. In general, less than 5 percent of women have retained products of conception or a complication. Complications of dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E), in addition to retained products of conception, include cervical laceration, uterine perforation, infection, and hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H441158365\"><span class=\"h2\">Retained products of conception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retained products of conception are found following less than 1 percent of second-trimester D&amp;E procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

In some cases, a perforation results in hemorrhage or damage to the bowel or bladder or to large vessels. Factors that increase the risk of uterine perforation include increasing gestational age, cervical abnormalities, multiparity, and an inexperienced provider. Perforations in the second trimester are more likely to involve injury to bowel or other structures than those occurring in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/28,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,46</a>].

Surgeons can reduce the frequency of cervical laceration by using cervical preparation and by appropriate technique with mechanical dilators.</p><p>Most cervical lacerations are small and require no intervention, provided they remain hemostatic. Treatment options for bleeding lacerations include clamp compression for several minutes, application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> solution (Monsel solution) or suturing. Cervical lacerations of the internal os, also known as &quot;cervical fractures,&quot; can dissect laterally into the paracervical space, causing severe hemorrhage or hematoma formation. Surgeons should suspect high cervical injury when bleeding continues postoperatively despite preservation of normal uterine tone. Application of pressure and ferric subsulfate solution controls many of these injuries.

Uterine atony is the most common cause of hemorrhage following D&amp;E and complicates approximately 2 percent of D&amp;E procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Prior cesarean section is also associated with an increased risk of postabortion hemorrhage. This increase in risk is seen after one cesarean (1.8 times higher in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]), and notably was 7.4 times higher after two or more cesarean deliveries in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Operators confronting patients with a history of prior cesarean should consider taking perioperative measures to reduce the likelihood of hemorrhage, including use of vasopressin in the paracervical block and utilization of preoperative cervical ripening agents.

Other surgical approaches include intact D&amp;E, which is a variant of D&amp;E, and hysterotomy. Hysterotomy is rarely used except when it is unsafe to dilate the cervix or induce labor. (See <a href=\"#H441158954\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The D&amp;E procedure consists of two components: (1) preparation and dilation of the cervix with osmotic, pharmacologic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mechanical dilators, and (2) evacuation of the uterus with suction, extraction forceps, and curettage. (See <a href=\"#H441159185\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to cervical preparation prior to second-trimester termination depends upon the gestational age. For women undergoing second-trimester surgical abortion at <strong>&gt;16 weeks of gestation</strong>, osmotic dilators are the most effective method. As a single method of cervical preparation, we recommend osmotic dilators rather than a pharmacologic agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, for women in whom osmotic dilation alone is not effective or who have risk factors for difficult dilation, we suggest that osmotic dilators be used <strong>with</strong> a pharmacologic agent rather than osmotic dilators alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For use as an adjunct to osmotic dilators, we suggest mifepristone rather than misoprostol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing second-trimester surgical abortion at <strong>&le;16 weeks of gestation</strong>, same-day cervical preparation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or Dilapin-S alone is a reasonable option, rather than with either overnight osmotic dilators alone or misoprostol combined with osmotic dilators. This approach is appropriate for women who do not have risk factors for cervical stenosis, and it offers that advantage of completing the procedure in one day. (See <a href=\"#H441157417\" class=\"local\">'Cervical preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women undergoing second-trimester D&amp;E, we suggest not using preprocedure feticide (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Use of feticidal injection is a reasonable option for women who place a high value on preprocedure feticidal injection and who are willing to accept a potential increased risk of extramural birth, infection, and other adverse effects (nausea or pelvic pain). (See <a href=\"#H441157768\" class=\"local\">'Injection to induce fetal demise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgeons must document completion of D&amp;E by inspecting the products of conception for the four extremities and calvaria. Intraoperative pelvic ultrasound can assist surgeons performing D&amp;E, particularly in a teaching setting. (See <a href=\"#H441158327\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for retained products of conception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, fewer than 5 percent of women who undergo second-trimester D&amp;E have retained products of conception or a complication. Potential complications of second-trimester D&amp;E include retained products of conception, uterine perforation, cervical laceration, infection, and hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H441158333\" class=\"local\">'Outcome and complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 135: Second-trimester abortion.
