Prior to that time, testicular cancer accounted for 11 percent of all cancer deaths in men between the ages of 25 to 34, and the five-year survival rate was 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Over the past 30 years, testis cancer incidence has increased 50 percent while mortality has declined 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Currently, there are approximately 400 deaths per year in the United States, and the five-year survival rate is over 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Cisplatin-based regimens can cure patients with advanced GCTs, even in the context of widespread visceral metastases, highly elevated serum tumor markers, or other adverse prognostic features. Following chemotherapy, the role of surgery depends on the histological type; for men with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs), a multimodality approach of chemotherapy followed by resection of all residual masses when technically feasible is the standard of care. In contrast, advanced stage seminomas are often managed with chemotherapy alone; the resection (or biopsies) of residual masses are only performed under certain specific circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-risk-stratified-treatment-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial risk-stratified treatment for advanced testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Men with rising tumor markers at the end of treatment have chemorefractory disease. In general, these patients should be treated with second-line systemic chemotherapy, although surgery may represent the patient's best chance of cure in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A general overview of the treatment of testicular cancer and the role of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early stage GCT (primarily in relation to men with NSGCT) are presented separately.

The FDG-PET results are used to make surgical recommendations in these patients. The 3 cm cut-off is based on the results of the SEMinoma PET (SEMPET) trial that included 51 men treated for seminoma, all of whom had residual lesions postchemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Using a size cut-off of 3 cm, PET had a specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100, 96, 74, and 70 percent, respectively. In general, progression of such masses is very uncommon following chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], so we reserve surgery only for cases in which there is increased FDG activity.

Two radiologic patterns are usually described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The retroperitoneal mass may have the appearance of a sheet of tissue around the great vessels, obliterating radiographic planes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Such a mass tends to merge with the great vessels, psoas muscles, and other retroperitoneal structures. This appearance usually represents fibrosis and is often unresectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroperitoneal masses may appear delineated and distinct from surrounding structures. Compared with the above pattern of radiographic abnormality, these masses are more likely to be resectable and often represent residual seminoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632906047\"><span class=\"h2\">NSGCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike in seminoma, imaging cannot reliably exclude the presence of active disease on the basis of size. For example, in one series of 87 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teratoma or viable malignant GCT was identified in 30 and 8 percent of men who had a residual retroperitoneal mass &lt;2 cm, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the cut-off for residual mass size was reduced to &lt;1 cm, 11 percent (6 of 54 men) had viable malignant GCTs. Despite this, the final pathology identified in subcentimeter disease does not appear to have any relevance to the prognosis of the patient. Therefore, surgical resection is not necessarily required in this specific subgroup of patients. (See <a href=\"#H87066259\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical intervention'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In contrast to the situation in seminoma, there is no role for FDG-PET scans in the work-up of residual disease seen on CT or MRI of men with NSGCT.

This was shown in a multicenter study of 121 men who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) for residual masses greater than 1 cm after cisplatin-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PET scans were positive in only 47 of 67 cases (70 percent) with pathologically confirmed tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 54 cases that were pathologically negative, PET imaging was positive in 33.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF RESIDUAL MASSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of residual masses present at the completion of chemotherapy includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrosis or fibrosis (40 to 50 percent of retroperitoneal masses).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mature or immature teratoma (30 to 40 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual non-teratomatous germ cell tumor (GCT) (10 to 20 percent), although the percentage of patients with viable GCT may be higher in those who have received multiple chemotherapy regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p/><p>Unfortunately, it is generally not possible to distinguish these possibilities on imaging. For example, multiple factors may predict the histology of residual retroperitoneal masses in men with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT), including the presence of teratomatous elements in the primary tumor, levels of serum tumor markers prior to chemotherapy, and the degree of reduction in mass size during chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18-20,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20,24-26</a>].

Postchemotherapy resection of residual masses or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is often followed by normalization of tumor markers and durable long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. As an example, of 114 patients with persistently elevated markers after first-line (n = 50) or second-line (n = 64) chemotherapy, postchemotherapy RPLND was associated with an overall five-year survival rate of 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum tumor markers in testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For these men, persistently elevated or sluggishly declining serum beta-hCG is rare and the relevance of such a finding is not well defined. Therefore, decisions about management of residual masses in men with pure seminoma are not generally based on serum beta-hCG levels. The management of residual masses in men with pure seminomas is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H632905800\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87066305\"><span class=\"h3\">Surveillance as an alternative option</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to note that there is no consensus on the best approach to manage men with NSGCTs who have persistently elevated serum tumor markers that are either stable or sluggishly declining at the end of treatment. For men who choose not to undergo surgery for whatever reason, surveillance is reasonable and may help determine the most appropriate management. The rationale for surveillance builds on the risk that tumor markers may rise in the immediate postoperative period while the patient is recovering from surgery, which may cause an undesirable delay to the start of second-line chemotherapy.</p><p>For men with NSGCT who choose not to proceed with surgery for whatever reason, we base subsequent decisions about surgery on the changes of tumor markers during surveillance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the markers rise, patients have refractory GCT and should be treated with systemic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-risk-stratified-treatment-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial risk-stratified treatment for advanced testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the markers normalize over time, men should undergo resection of any residual mass &gt;1 cm.

These masses rarely contain viable tumor if resected and men rarely relapse if they are not resected. In addition, at least one report suggests that approximately one-half of such masses will disappear during surveillance within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. For men with larger lesions, we routinely will obtain a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan to further assess whether or not to proceed with surgery.

Centers that are not accustomed to performing RPLNDs should refer the patient to a center of excellence with extensive experience in resecting postchemotherapy residual GCT masses whenever possible. Similarly, residual masses elsewhere, including enlarged lymph nodes in the thorax, neck, or pelvis, and metastatic lesions in the lung, liver, brain, or other organs should be resected if technically feasible. (See <a href=\"#H632905800\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach to small lesions is controversial, and only low quality data are available. Our approach is not to proceed with surgery in men with NSGCT with residual masses &le;1 cm if the tumor markers have normalized, despite the potential risk of GCT in these subcentimeter lesions.

For patients with smaller lesions (ie, &lt;1 cm), careful surveillance is preferred, but retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is a reasonable alternative for men with subcentimeter residual retroperitoneal masses.

In the absence of a clear survival benefit to surgery, either approach is reasonable. For patients who opt for surveillance in the presence of slowly declining markers, we suggest surgery once their markers normalize (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
