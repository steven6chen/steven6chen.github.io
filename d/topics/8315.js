Larvae are found on sandy beaches, in sand boxes, and under dwellings.</p><p>Individuals at greatest risk include travelers, children, swimmers, and laborers whose activities bring their skin in contact with contaminated soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) is a common cause of dermatologic disease among those returning from travel in tropical regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>In one series of British travelers, infections were acquired most commonly in Africa, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and, less commonly, Central and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In another review of Canadian travelers, infections were acquired most commonly in the Caribbean (most often Jamaica) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a review of HrCLM developing in 43 travelers returning to France, infections were acquired in the Americas (37 percent), Africa (33 percent), Asia (28 percent), and one case in Portugal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, HrCLM has occurred in residents of several European countries in the absence of travel to tropical regions, likely due to local exposures to animal hookworms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-lesions-in-the-returning-traveler\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin lesions in the returning traveler&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31956718\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hookworm life cycle in the definitive host is very similar to the hookworm life cycle for human species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61675 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73772\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73772 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hookworm-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hookworm infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Eggs are passed in the stool of the definitive host (adult dog or cat). Under favorable conditions (moisture, warmth, shade), rhabditiform larvae hatch in 1 to 2 days. After 5 to 10 days (and two molts), they become filariform (third-stage) larvae, which are infective and can survive 3 to 4 weeks in favorable environmental conditions.</p><p>Upon contact with the nonhuman animal host, the filariform larvae penetrate the skin and are carried through the blood vessels to the lungs, where they penetrate into the pulmonary alveoli, ascend the bronchial tree to the pharynx, and are swallowed. The larvae reach the small intestine, where they reside and mature into adults, which attach to the intestinal wall. Some larvae become arrested in the tissues and serve as a source of infection for puppies or kittens via transmammary (and possibly transplacental) routes.</p><p>Humans may become infected when filariform larvae in the soil partially penetrate the skin. The larvae of most species cannot mature within the human host since humans are accidental intermediate hosts. The larvae migrate within the epidermis and lack the collagenase necessary to break through the basement membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The larvae produce an inflammatory reaction along the cutaneous tract of their migration, which may continue for weeks.</p><p>Some larvae may access deeper tissues. Rarely, pulmonary involvement occurs, either via direct invasion or secondary to a systemic immunologic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CUTANEOUS DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) occurs most frequently on the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. In a report of 98 travelers, lesions most often involved the lower extremities (73 percent); the buttocks and anogenital region, trunk, and upper extremities were involved in 13, 7, and 7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Initially, a pruritic erythematous papule can develop at the site of each larval penetration; many patients are unaware of the penetration site. With exposure to heavily contaminated soil, up to several hundred pruritic papules may develop. Within a few days thereafter, intensely pruritic, elevated, serpiginous, reddish-brown tracks appear as the larvae migrate at a rate of several millimeters (up to a few centimeters) per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60144\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60144 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The lesions are approximately 3 mm wide and may be up to 15 to 20 mm in length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the larva itself is usually located 1 to 2 cm ahead of the eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Usually one to three lesions are present.</p><p>Serpiginous lesions usually develop two to six days after exposure but may occur weeks or even many months after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. In one review, cutaneous lesions appeared after return from travel with a mean time of onset of 5 to 16 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Vesiculobullous lesions develop in about 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>], and the presence of nodular and bullous lesions may delay the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lesions may become vesiculated, encrusted, or secondarily infected. The pruritus can be so intense that it causes sleep disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/8,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,23</a>]. Eventually the lesions resolve spontaneously even in the absence of specific therapy. This usually occurs in two to eight weeks, although longer duration of infection has been reported, and cutaneous symptoms may recur days to months later. In one series, 29 percent of patients had lesions that persisted for one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Occasionally, larvae persist in follicles and cause disease for as long as two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Hookworm folliculitis is an uncommon form of HrCLM, occurring in less than 5 percent of cases; it consists of numerous follicular, erythematous, and pruritic papules and pustules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Serpiginous tracks may be absent or relatively short [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/13,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HrCLM is based on clinical history and physical findings. Infected patients typically have a history of exposure to contaminated soil or sand (walking barefoot or lying on sand) and the characteristic serpiginous lesion on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60144\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60144 \">picture 1</a>). Eosinophilia is rare.</p><p>There are emerging reports of dermoscopy being used to facilitate diagnosis of CLM; features include translucent, brown, structureless areas corresponding to the larval bodies, and red-dotted vessels corresponding to an empty burrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anthelminthic therapy for HrCLM is helpful for relieving symptoms and reducing the likelihood of bacterial superinfection.</p><p>Options for treatment include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a>. The preferred treatment is ivermectin (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> orally once daily for one or two days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. A single dose of ivermectin results in cure rates of 94 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with hookworm folliculitis should be treated with two doses of ivermectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Albendazole (400 mg orally with fatty meal for three days) is an acceptable alternative treatment. For patients with extensive or multiple lesions, a seven-day course of albendazole may be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Symptoms generally disappear within one week after treatment; frequently, the pruritus settles before the dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Treatment of hookworm folliculitis may be difficult, and repeated courses of oral anthelmintic agents may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Topical agents are an alternative treatment option, though they can be difficult to obtain. Topical thiabendazole (15 percent in a hygroscopic base for five days) is effective in alleviating pruritus and halting progression of lesions, usually within two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/14,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,29</a>]. A topical 10% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> ointment, prepared by crushing three 400 mg tablets of albendazole in 12 g of petroleum jelly, has also been reported to be effective when administered three times daily for 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In addition to antiparasitic agents, antihistamines are helpful for management of pruritus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematogenous dissemination of larvae to the lungs is a rare complication of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Larva currens has a prominent urticarial component and is notable for its rapidity. The larval track of larva currens can progress approximately 1 cm in five minutes and 5 to 15 cm per hour; the larval track of HrCLM can progress up to 1 to 2 cm per day. The diagnosis of strongyloidiasis is established by larva detection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serology.
