The incidence of late-onset pneumonia (more than four days after intubation) was significantly lower with sucralfate compared with pH-altering drugs (5 versus 16 percent with antacids and 21 percent with ranitidine). Patients who received sucralfate had a lower median gastric pH and less frequent gastric colonization compared with the other groups. Nevertheless, when patients with pH &gt;4 were evaluated separately, the patients receiving sucralfate still exhibited lower rates of gastric colonization, suggesting that sucralfate may possess intrinsic antibacterial activity. There was a trend toward an increased incidence of gastric bleeding in patients taking sucralfate compared with antacids and ranitidine (10, 4, and 6 percent, respectively), but this difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>Gastric acid suppressive therapy with H<sub>2</sub> blockers or PPIs appears to increase the risk of community-acquired pneumonia.

We agree with the recommendations included in these guidelines. Although evidence supporting the use of bundles is mixed, combining a core set of prevention measures into a bundle can be a practical way to enhance care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/36-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-43</a>].

Appropriate patient positioning and subglottic drainage in ventilated patients are two important modalities for the prevention of aspiration.

Due to the possible increase in mortality, the combined European and Latin American guidelines chose not to issue a recommendation on chlorhexidine use for VAP prevention until further efficacy data is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Meta-analyses have shown that SDD reduces the risk of VAP and HAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>]. Both SOD and SDD have shown mortality benefits in trials of ICU patients performed mainly in regions with low baseline antimicrobial resistance rates. The applicability of the studies showing benefit to other settings has been questioned since very low rates of antibiotic resistance were present at the institutions included in the key trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].

Available results do not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of probiotics for the prevention of VAP. We therefore do not use probiotics for the prevention of VAP.</p><p>A 2014 meta-analysis evaluated eight randomized trials with 1083 participants that compared a probiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lactobacillus</a> spp) with a control (placebo, glutamine, fermentable fiber, peptide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>) for the prevention of VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The use of probiotics decreased the incidence of VAP from 29 to 21 percent (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95). No significant differences in mortality, length of ICU stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation were detected. Adverse effects were not estimable in this analysis. Similar findings were observed in a 2017 meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]; however, the quality of the evidence in each meta-analysis was low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Silver-coated endotracheal tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not use silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ETTs).

Among patients intubated for more than 24 hours, the rate of microbiologically confirmed VAP was significantly lower with the silver-coated ETT (4.8 versus 7.5 percent).

Developing VAP prevention bundles is a practical way to enhance care. However, there is no consensus about which care processes to include, definitions of VAP vary, baseline VAP rates differ among institutions, and there is substantial heterogeneity in different hospitals' bundles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
