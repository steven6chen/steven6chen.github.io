However, they also contribute directly to pathologic vascular thrombosis. This relationship constitutes the rationale for the use of antiplatelet agents in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of platelets in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Three intravenous platelet glycoprotein (GP) <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors have been studied extensively and are available for clinical use: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abciximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tirofiban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tirofiban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eptifibatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eptifibatide</a>. Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor, while tirofiban and eptifibatide are high affinity non-antibody receptor inhibitors.</p><p>Antiplatelet therapy with intravenous GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors has been evaluated in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in those undergoing intracoronary stent implantation. Dual oral antiplatelet therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker has decreased the role of GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> therapy in these settings, although it continues to be important in some subgroups of patients with CHD. </p><p>This topic summarizes the early trials of GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors performed <strong>before</strong> the routine use of intracoronary stents in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker therapy in patients with ACS or those undergoing stenting. These early trials collectively formed the basis of a high-intensity, platelet-directed approach (in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) to pharmacotherapy for patients at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI), recurring MI, intra-coronary thromboembolism, and, with the increasing deployment of stents in routine clinical practice, acute stent thrombosis.</p><p>The role of platelet GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors in patients who receive currently recommended treatment with dual (oral) antiplatelet therapy is discussed elsewhere.

The ability of platelets to adhere to abnormal surfaces and aggregate is mediated by surface membrane glycoprotein (GP) receptors that can be expressed in greater numbers and assume a more ligand-binding conformation upon platelet activation. Accordingly, they represent attractive targets for pharmacologic inhibition.</p><p>The platelet GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptor is of particular interest because of its central role in platelet adhesion and aggregation. Following platelet activation, GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> undergoes a conformational change, rendering it competent to bind protein ligands, including Von Willebrand factor in general and fibrinogen in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-trials-of-platelet-glycoprotein-iib-iiia-receptor-inhibitors-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Platelet function generally recovers over the course of 48 hours; however, abciximab remains in the circulation for up to 10 days in the platelet-bound state. Upon completion of a constant infusion, free plasma concentrations fall rapidly over the next six hours then decline at a slower rate. The low concentration of free drug in plasma becomes important if serious bleeding occurs and a platelet transfusion is given. More precisely, there is little drug to bind and inhibit new platelets introduced, endogenously or exogenously, to the circulation. </p><p>Intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abciximab</a> in doses ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> produces a rapid dose-dependent inhibition of platelet function as measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or thrombin receptor-activated peptide (TRAP). At the highest dose, 80 percent of the platelet GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptors are occupied within two hours and platelet aggregation is near completely inhibited. Sustained inhibition is achieved with continuous infusions (12 to 24 hours) and low-level receptor blockade is present for up to 10 days following cessation of the infusion.
