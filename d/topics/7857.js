A single grain is comprised of an individual fruit containing a single seed. The fruit wall and seed coat are fused and cannot be separated. Seeds, on the other hand, can be separated from the fruit. Despite this distinction, many seeds are called grains because of how they are used. In this topic, the term &quot;grain&quot; is used for true grains and also for seeds that are used as grains. Wheat, rye, barley, oat, rice, and corn are grains, whereas millet, amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat are seeds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488931372\"><span class=\"h2\">Grain use worldwide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grains constitute a staple food for most of the world's population. Wheat, rice, and corn are the most commonly produced and consumed grains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-allergens-and-grain-classification/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corn originated in the Americas. It is the most widely grown grain crop worldwide but is primarily grown for livestock and poultry consumption and industrial uses (eg, ethanol).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheat originated in the Levant region of the Near East and Ethiopia and is now cultivated worldwide. It is the second most produced grain crop. Most of the world production is consumed by humans in the form of breads and other baked products, pasta, wheat noodles, bulgur, and couscous. Wheat starch and gluten proteins are also used in food processing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rice originated in China from where it spread to the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. It is the third most produced and second most consumed grain crop worldwide. Rice is primarily consumed as a cooked whole grain, although raw rice is also ground into flour that is used in various products (eg, noodles, rice milk).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Millet ranks as the sixth most important &quot;grain&quot; in the world and is a major crop in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. In Western countries, it is mainly used as bird and cattle feed. However, it is starting to become a more popular product in Western populations because millet contains various high-quality proteins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amaranth is another seed commonly consumed in India, where it is cooked as a cereal, ground into flour, popped like popcorn, sprouted, or toasted in confectionary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common buckwheat is a non-cereal grain crop that is taxonomically unrelated to wheat, despite a name that suggests otherwise. The seed is used to make a dark flour that is the main ingredient of several Asiatic, Russian, and European dishes (eg, crepes, small pancakes, bagels, breads, breakfast cereals, and noodles).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quinoa is a plant that originated in the Andean region of Bolivia and Peru. Its seed is often eaten in the United States as a grain substitute.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1293050\"><span class=\"h1\">GRAIN ALLERGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute allergic responses to grains are due to immunoglobulin E (IgE) directed against various allergens in grains. This section reviews the grain allergens. The pathogenesis of non-IgE-mediated grain allergy and grain allergy due to mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated processes is less well understood.

In one study, intensive IgE staining to <span class=\"nowrap\">neutral/acidic</span> soluble proteins was seen, with major IgE binding to 46 and 66 kDa proteins in oats, but no specific IgE-staining patterns correlating with clinical cereal sensitivity were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-allergens-and-grain-classification/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1293097\"><span class=\"h3\">Corn (maize)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LTP was identified by IgE immunoblotting as the major corn allergen in Italian populations in two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-allergens-and-grain-classification/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] but was not recognized by any of the Swiss patients in one of the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-allergens-and-grain-classification/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other allergens identified in patients with a history of corn-induced anaphylaxis or positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) to corn are 14 kDa alpha-amylase inhibitor, 30 kDa endochitinases A and B, 19 kDa zein-beta precursor, and 26 kDa zein-alpha precursor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-allergens-and-grain-classification/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Of the remaining proteins, 15 percent represent salt-soluble globulins and albumins, and 5 percent include alcohol-soluble prolamins. The <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha-amylase/trypsin</span> inhibitor in the albumin fraction is the major allergen in rice grain extracts and belongs to the same cereal alpha-amylase inhibitor family as the wheat allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-allergens-and-grain-classification/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].
