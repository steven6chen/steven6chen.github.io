Upper UTIs (ie, acute pyelonephritis) may lead to renal scarring, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. Although children with pyelonephritis tend to present with fever, it is often difficult on clinical grounds to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis, particularly in young children (those younger than two years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, we have defined UTI broadly here without attempting to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis. Acute cystitis in older children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cystitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-older-than-two-years-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cystitis: Clinical features and diagnosis in children older than two years and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of risk factors for UTI and renal scarring in a child presenting with fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary symptoms is helpful in guiding diagnostic testing and management. The epidemiology and risk factors for UTI and renal scarring in children will be reviewed here. Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of UTI, and UTI in newborns (younger than one month of age) are discussed separately.

Other gram-negative bacterial pathogens include <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em>, and <em>Citrobacter</em>. Gram-positive bacterial pathogens include <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em>, <em>Enterococcus</em>, and, rarely, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p><p>Infection with an organism other than <em>E. coli</em> is associated with a higher likelihood of renal scarring. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data from nine studies including 1280 children (0 to 18 years) who underwent renal scintigraphy at least five months after their first UTI, non-<em>E. coli</em> UTI was associated with an increased risk of renal scarring (odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Viruses (eg, adenovirus, enteroviruses, Coxsackieviruses, echoviruses) and fungi (eg, <em>Candida</em> spp, <em>Aspergillus</em> spp, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, endemic mycoses) are uncommon causes of UTI in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Viral UTI are usually limited to the lower urinary tract. Risk factors for fungal UTI include immunosuppression and long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and indwelling urinary catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The presence of pathogens on the periurethral mucosa, however, is not sufficient to cause UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pathogens attach to the uroepithelial cells via an active process mediated by glycosphingolipid receptors on the surface of epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

TLR binding triggers a cytokine response, which generates a local inflammatory response.</p><p>A variety of virulence factors enable bacteria to ascend into the bladder and kidney. The best-studied virulence factors in <em>E. coli</em> are pili, hair-like appendages on the cell surface. Bacteria possessing pili can adhere effectively to the uroepithelium and ascend into the kidney, even in children without vesicoureteral reflux. In the kidney, the bacterial inoculum generates an intense inflammatory response, which may ultimately lead to renal scarring.

The keratinization of the mucosa is largely complete by one year of age and temporally coincides with the decreasing prevalence of UTI in boys.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial obstruction of the urethral meatus by a tight foreskin may be the explanation for the higher incidence of UTI in uncircumcised boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In one study of uncircumcised male infants (&lt;7 months of age), inability to retract the foreskin to expose the urethral meatus was more common among boys with febrile UTI than among those without UTI (85 versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

A systematic review of randomized and observational studies of circumcision for the prevention of UTI found that 111 circumcisions would be needed to prevent one UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Sensitivity analysis of a decision model for circumcision suggested that the decision to circumcise a boy hinges more heavily on the parents' values regarding pain than on the UTI prevalence or circumcision complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This observation underscores the importance of respecting parental values as they decide whether to circumcise their sons.

This has been presumed to be the result of the shorter female urethra. However, because the incidence of UTI in male neonates is as high, if not higher, than in female neonates, the importance of the length of the urethra in the pathogenesis of UTI has been questioned. Alternatively, the propensity of bacterial attachment to the female periurethral mucosa may account for this difference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Race/ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For reasons that are not completely understood, white children have a two- to fourfold higher prevalence of UTI than do black children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-degree relatives of children with UTI are more likely to have UTI than individuals without such a history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].
