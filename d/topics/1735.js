It happens when the lining that covers the brain and spinal cord (called the &quot;meninges&quot;) gets inflamed or infected.</p><p>There are 2 main types of meningitis, depending on which germs are causing the infection. Bacteria cause bacterial meningitis. Viruses cause viral meningitis, which is also called aseptic meningitis. Both types of meningitis can cause similar symptoms.</p><p>It is very important that doctors figure out what kind of meningitis a person has. That's because bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. If it is not treated quickly, it can lead to brain problems such as hearing loss or learning problems. It can also lead to death.</p><p>This article discusses bacterial meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5971874\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bacterial meningitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of bacterial meningitis usually come on suddenly, so people can get very sick over a short period of time. Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; But some people have a temperature that is lower than normal instead of a fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck &ndash; This happens most often in adults and children. Babies might not get a stiff neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting confused, or being hard to wake up</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having light bother a person's eyes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rash that looks like red or purple spots on the skin that do not go away when touched </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

If you have a fever, headache, and stiff neck, go to the emergency room right away. If you think your child has meningitis, bring him or her to the emergency room right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5971904\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will learn about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will do tests to see if you have meningitis and find out what type of bacteria is causing the infection. The tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle into your lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will do lab tests on the spinal fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of the brain &ndash; This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5971921\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bacterial meningitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People are treated in the hospital with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines that go into a vein through a tube called an &quot;IV&quot; &ndash; The antibiotics used depend on the type of bacteria causing the infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids and other medicines that go into a vein &ndash; These medicines sometimes include &ldquo;&quot;steroids.&quot; The steroids help protect your brain from the effects of the bacterial meningitis. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5971936\"><span class=\"h1\">Can bacterial meningitis be spread from 1 person to another?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. It depends on the type of bacteria that's causing the infection. Some types of bacteria can be spread from 1 person to another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5971953\"><span class=\"h1\">Can bacterial meningitis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. Certain vaccines can help prevent bacterial meningitis. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.</p><p>To help prevent bacterial meningitis, make sure that you and your children have had all of the vaccines you need to prevent the following infections. Your doctor will decide which of these you and your children need:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningococcus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b, called &quot;Hib&quot; (for babies and young children)</p><p/><p>If someone in your home has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor or nurse if you should take antibiotics. Sometimes, other people at home need to take antibiotics to keep from getting the infection.</p><p>Plus, you can help avoid getting sick by washing your hands well before eating, and not sharing cups or silverware.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5971968\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-meningitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral meningitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
