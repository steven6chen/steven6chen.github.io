It accounts for nearly 10 percent of pediatric emergency department visits and 20 percent of hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Respiratory distress in children, particularly neonates and infants, must be promptly recognized and aggressively treated because they may decompensate quickly. Factors that contribute to rapid respiratory compromise in children include smaller airways, increased metabolic demands, decreased respiratory reserves, and inadequate compensatory mechanisms as compared to adults. Respiratory arrest is the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children and outcomes are poor for patients who develop cardiopulmonary arrest as the result of respiratory deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a child with acute respiratory distress includes determining the severity, as well as the underlying cause. Tachypnea and in neonates, infants, and young children, retractions, are hallmarks of respiratory distress. Respiratory distress may manifest as inadequate respiratory effort, most often in those who have tired from attempts to compensate for respiratory compromise, those with underlying neuromuscular disease and those with disordered control of breathing (eg, bronchiolitis, opioid overdose). Tachypnea and decreased respiratory effort can lead to respiratory failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arrest.</p><p>The emergency evaluation of the child with respiratory distress must first determine the severity of respiratory distress and the need for emergent intervention. Features of the history and physical examination will ideally localize the source, as well as suggest the etiology and direct initial treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79944 \">table 1</a>). Ancillary studies can then be performed as indicated to confirm the diagnosis and guide management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82210 \">table 2</a>). The clinical features and evaluation of specific conditions that cause acute respiratory distress in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute respiratory distress in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of etiology, the initial management of respiratory distress in children requires immediate evaluation and supportive care of airway, breathing, and circulation. For some conditions, specific interventions (ie, bronchodilator therapy for asthma or decompression of a pneumothorax) may rapidly relieve symptoms. With prompt aggressive treatment of respiratory distress and its underlying cause, most children with respiratory distress recover uneventfully.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial rapid assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pediatric assessment triangle (PAT) focuses initial evaluation on appearance, breathing, and circulation for acutely ill or injured children to quickly identify conditions that require immediate intervention. The PAT is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-stabilization-of-children-with-respiratory-or-circulatory-compromise#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise&quot;, section on 'Pediatric assessment triangle'</a>.)</p><p>Features of the PAT that are specific to children with acute respiratory distress include (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'General observation'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Appearance </strong>&ndash; Restlessness, anxiety and combativeness are early manifestations of air hunger or hypoxia. Somnolence and lethargy are indicative of severe hypoxia, hypercarbia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory fatigue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breathing </strong>&ndash; The initial response to respiratory compromise is usually tachypnea. Abnormal airway sounds (eg, stridor, wheezing), increased accessory muscle use, and positioning to maximize airway opening (eg, &ldquo;sniffing&rdquo; position, &ldquo;tripod&rdquo; position) are other indicators of respiratory compromise. As respiratory distress progresses, respiratory rate often decreases and the pattern of respirations becomes irregular. These are ominous signs. Without intervention, respiratory arrest quickly ensues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Circulation</strong>&ndash; Pallor, ashen color, and cyanosis are concerning findings that may indicate hypoxemia, but may also be observed in patients with shock. </p><p/><p>Conditions that require immediate, life-saving interventions include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57278 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete or rapidly progressing partial upper airway obstruction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tension pneumothorax</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory failure</p><p/><p>Throughout this evaluation, every reasonable effort must be made to keep the child calm and comfortable, since anxiety and crying can substantially increase the work of breathing in young children by decreasing upper airway diameter and increasing metabolic demand for oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The child should be positioned or allowed to maintain the position that best supports their respiratory effort. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed history should be obtained once the child's condition is stabilized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-stabilization-of-children-with-respiratory-or-circulatory-compromise#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise&quot;, section on 'Initial stabilization'</a>.)</p><p>Helpful historical information includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma</strong> &ndash; A history of recent trauma suggests specific diagnoses, such as pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, flail chest, cardiac tamponade, intraabdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> central nervous system injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Change in voice</strong> &ndash; Many children with acute upper airway pathology will have a change in voice (either muffled or hoarse). In comparison, those with lower airway processes have a normal voice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Onset and duration of symptoms</strong> &ndash; The abrupt onset of gagging or choking suggests upper airway conditions, such as an aspirated foreign body, allergy, or irritant exposure. A child who suddenly complains of chest pain may have a pneumothorax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An infant who gradually develops tachypnea and retractions may have asthma, bronchopulmonary infection, lower airway foreign body, enlarging pneumothorax, or heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Associated symptoms</strong> &ndash; Fever suggests an infectious etiology. Fever itself can result in an increase in respiratory rate of three to seven breaths per minute per degree centigrade above normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A child with tachypnea without fever, URI symptoms, or cough may be compensating for a metabolic acidosis. A complaint of abdominal pain may indicate a gastrointestinal process (ie, appendicitis or bowel obstruction), diaphragmatic irritation from a pneumonic condition (as can occur with basilar pneumonia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pleural effusion), or a metabolic abnormally (ie, ketoacidosis from diabetes). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recent travel</strong> &ndash; Approximately 20 percent of recent travelers develop respiratory infections, most of which are upper airway infections. Pathogens that are unusual in the United States and may cause serious respiratory compromise include Avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Keep in mind that influenza season in the Southern hemisphere is April through September, peak June through August. In the tropics, influenza is a risk throughout the year. Measles and mumps also cause respiratory distress. The CDC <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsS2w2f795le/W5BejjZJaFc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a> has up to date information on outbreaks.

As an example, an infant or young child who is wheezing, and has not been diagnosed with asthma, may have had previous episodes of wheezing that responded to bronchodilators</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underlying medical conditions</strong> &ndash; Respiratory distress may be an acute manifestation of a process associated with a specific chronic medical condition (ie, acute chest syndrome in a child with sickle cell disease) or a complication of a chronic condition (ie, pneumothorax in a patient with asthma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children#H13169188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute respiratory distress in children&quot;, section on 'Acute on chronic diseases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family history</strong> &ndash; Family history of inheritable conditions (including asthma, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus) may give clues to possible undiagnosed etiologies of respiratory distress. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial physical examination of the child with severe respiratory distress should be completed rapidly, focusing on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, but recognizing that other organ system processes may be the etiology of respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>After rapid assessment of airway, breathing and circulation, vital signs, including pulse oximetry, and actual or estimated weight, should be obtained. Side port capnography, is helpful in detecting hypercarbia. Once the child is stabilized, the clinician should perform a complete physical examination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">General observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following observations suggest severe respiratory distress:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mental status</strong> &ndash; Agitation and combativeness suggest early air hunger or hypoxia, while somnolence and lethargy are manifestations of severe hypoxemia or hypercarbia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Position of comfort</strong> &ndash; To maximize airway patency, a child with upper airway obstruction may sit upright and assume the &quot;sniffing position&quot; (neck flexed, head mildly extended) to align the airway axes and improve airflow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76538 \">picture 1</a>). With lower airway disease, the child may assume a &ldquo;tripod position&rdquo;, ie, sitting up and leaning forward on outstretched hands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cyanosis</strong> &ndash; Cyanosis is generally a late finding in children with hypoxemia. It is seen most often in those who have low cardiac output in addition to low arterial oxygen saturation. Severely anemic patients (hemoglobin &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> may not manifest cyanosis despite severe hypoxemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drooling, dysphagia</strong> &ndash; Inability to handle secretions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swallow are signs of oropharyngeal or laryngotracheal obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164272\"><span class=\"h3\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen saturation give clues to the presence and etiology of respiratory distress. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory rate</strong> &ndash; Normal respiratory rate varies by age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 4</a>). Tachypnea is one of the most important findings in children with respiratory conditions. Tachypnea may also occur due to fever, activity, crying, cardiac disease, and metabolic acidosis. Increases in respiratory rates of three to seven breaths per minute per degree Celsius above baseline have been reported in response to fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. For children &lt;12 months of age the compensatory increase may be as high as 7 to 11 breaths per minute per degree Celsius above baseline (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children#H13169095\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute respiratory distress in children&quot;, section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Apnea and bradypnea in neonates and infants with respiratory disease is usually the result of respiratory muscle fatigue. In neonates, particularly premature neonates central immaturity is a common cause of apnea. In young infants, apnea may be the initial manifestation of bronchiolitis or pertussis. Other etiologies of apnea in infants and young children are choking, breath holding, head trauma, including abusive head trauma from shaking, severe metabolic acidosis, and poisoning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart rate </strong>&ndash; Tachycardia due to increased sympathetic tone is commonly present in children with respiratory distress. With prolonged respiratory distress, tachycardia may reflect dehydration due, at least in part, to fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tachypnea. Bradycardia in a hypoxemic child is a late and ominous sign that often signals impending cardiopulmonary arrest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulsus paradoxus </strong>&ndash; Pulsus paradoxus with &gt;10 mmHg of the normal decrease in blood pressure during inspiration, correlates with degree of airway obstruction. Pulsus paradoxus occurs as the result of accentuated swings in pleural pressure between inspiration and expiration. It also occurs when hyperinflation of the lungs limits inspiratory filling, and therefore left ventricular stroke volume of the heart and in patients with cardiac tamponade. Although not specific, the presence of pulsus paradoxus is an important indicator of severe respiratory distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased cardiac output. Accurate measurement of pulsus paradoxus is often difficult in young children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Pulsus paradoxus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxygen saturation </strong>&ndash; A resting room air oxygen saturation &le;97 percent by pulse oximetry is abnormal in full-term infants and children although this measurement should not be considered in isolation in any individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Values &le;90 percent indicate significant tissue hypoxemia. Patients with oxygen saturations between 90 and 95 percent who are also tachypneic may also be hypoxemic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Oxygen saturation measurement may be falsely low due to the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry#H3929824205\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;, section on 'Troubleshooting sources of error'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Probe removal by the patient, improper placement, or motion artifact</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor peripheral perfusion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypothermia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Venous congestion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fingernail polish</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3777178\"><span class=\"h3\">Breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed assessment of breathing is imperative in children with respiratory distress and consists of inspection, abnormal sounds, auscultation, palpation, and percussion. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inspection </strong>&ndash; Some of the most valuable information regarding the severity and etiology of respiratory distress is obtained by careful observation noting:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Respiratory pattern</strong> &ndash; Rate, depth and rhythm of respiration may provide a clue to the etiology of respiratory distress:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Rapid, shallow breathing with prolonged exhalation is typically seen with air trapping, as occurs with asthma bronchiolitis or airway foreign body beyond the carina. It may also result from chest or abdominal pain or chest wall dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Kussmaul respirations (deep, regular, sighing breaths that may be rapid, slow, or normal in rate) suggest metabolic acidosis, particularly diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Cheyne-Stokes respirations (respirations with increasing then decreasing depth and rate alternating with periods of apnea) occur as the result of central nervous system immaturity in otherwise normal neonates, particularly during sleep. This pattern can also be seen in neonates, infants, and children with inadequate cerebral perfusion, brain injury, increased intracranial pressure, or central opioid depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Ataxic respirations (breaths of irregular depth interrupted irregularly by periods of apnea) suggest central nervous system infection, injury, or drug-induced depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Thoracoabdominal dissociation or paradoxical breathing (chest collapses on inspiration, while abdomen protrudes) is a sign of respiratory fatigue or muscle weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Tracheal deviation </strong>&ndash; Tracheal deviation is a key finding in tension pneumothorax. Air accumulation displaces the trachea to the side opposite the pneumothorax. Tracheal deviation may also be seen in patients with pulmonary emphysema, unilateral effusion, or a thoracic mass. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Accessory muscle use </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Accessory muscle use is an important indicator of respiratory distress in infants and children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Nasal flaring, exaggerated opening of the nostrils during inspiration, is a subtle form of severe accessory muscle use that is commonly seen in neonates and infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Head bobbing, extension of the head and neck during inhalation and falling forward of the head during exhalation, is less common than other manifestations of accessory muscle use and is also most likely to be seen in neonates and infants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Retractions of the muscles of the chest wall result from high negative intrathoracic pressure generated by increased respiratory effort. Supraclavicular and suprasternal retractions are usually indicative of upper airway obstruction, but may be seen with severe lower airway processes. Intracostal and subcostal retractions are indicators of lower airway obstruction but can be seen in severe upper airway obstruction. Mild retractions may be normal in neonates and infants. Severe retractions of more than one muscle group indicate significant distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Abdominal breathing, characterized by thoracoabdominal dissociation, in which the chest collapses and the abdomen protrudes on inspiration, may be normal in neonates and infants, but beyond infancy, or in patients with poor muscle tone is concerning for respiratory muscle fatigue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Chest wall movement </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Chest excursion with inspiration is an indication of tidal volume. Poor movement indicates inadequate ventilation. In addition, asymmetric movement suggests a localized process, such as pneumothorax or flail chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal sounds</strong> &mdash; Many abnormal sounds can be appreciated without auscultation including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Stertor</strong> &ndash; Stertor, snoring, due to nasal obstruction, is most commonly caused by nasal congestion, tonsil <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adenoid hypertrophy, or neuromuscular weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Gurgling</strong> &ndash; Gurgling, which may be inspiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> expiratory is due to secretions in the posterior oropharynx, trachea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchi.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Stridor </strong>&ndash; Stridor is a type of inspiratory wheeze that localizes respiratory distress to the upper airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Change in voice</strong> &ndash; An abnormal voice, most commonly hoarse or muffled, suggests upper airway obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Aphonia</strong> &ndash; Aphonia results from complete upper airway obstruction or vocal cord dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cough</strong> &ndash; Acute cough may be due to infection, inflammation, bronchospasm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstruction. Quality and duration of cough provide clues to etiology. A barky cough indicates subglottic tracheal obstruction, most commonly due to croup. A staccato cough suggests pneumonia caused by Chlamydia or Mycoplasma. A dry, tight, cough may occur in patients with wheezing due to asthma or bronchiolitis, whereas a loose wet cough may indicate tracheal secretions or bacterial pneumonia. Causes of chronic cough in children are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic cough in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Wheezing</strong> &ndash; Wheezing can sometimes be heard without a stethoscope in patients with status asthmaticus, bronchiolitis, lower airway foreign body, or if inspiratory, in patients with croup or upper airway foreign body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Grunting</strong> &ndash; Grunting is an end expiratory sound that occurs as the result of exhalation against a partially closed glottis. It slows expiratory flow, increasing lung volume and alveolar pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Grunting is typically a sign of moderate to severe respiratory distress that occurs in young infants and children with lower airway disease, such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or pulmonary edema. It may also be heard in children with abdominal processes that limit respiratory effort due to pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal distension (eg, intraabdominal injury, perforated viscous).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Auscultation </strong>&ndash; Auscultation provides important information regarding the etiology of respiratory distress and localization of the underlying condition. Every effort should be made to quiet the infant or child during auscultation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of the following should be noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Wheezing </strong>&ndash; Diffuse expiratory wheezes are a sign of lower airway intrathoracic obstruction typically caused by asthma or bronchiolitis. They are musical in tone with higher pitched wheezes indicative of more severe obstruction. Unilateral wheezes may be appreciated if there is a foreign body in the lower airway. Inspiratory wheezes indicate an upper airway extrathoracic obstruction or a severe fixed intrathoracic obstruction, and are most commonly due to laryngeal edema or a foreign body. In severe cases, wheezes can be appreciated without a stethoscope. However, if asthma is so severe that air movement is poor, wheezes may not be heard. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Prolonged expiratory phase </strong>&ndash; A prolonged expiratory phase is a reliable sign of obstructed lower airways that can occur with or without wheezes. In the normal respiratory cycle, inspiration is longer than expiration (normal 3:1 for vesicular sounds, 2:1 bronchovesicular, 1:1 tracheal) with the exception of bronchial sounds for which expiration is slightly longer than inspiration. An expiratory phase that is longer than the inspiratory phase suggests obstruction even in the absence of wheezes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Upper airway sounds </strong>&ndash; Transmitted upper airway sounds are noted commonly in small children. Noises generated in the upper airway (ie, stertor due to nasal obstruction from congestion) are easily heard homogeneously throughout the lung fields, particularly in neonates and infants because of their small size and thin-walled chest. Inspiratory stridor suggests significant narrowing of the airway above the sternal notch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Decreased breath sounds </strong>&ndash; Decreased breath sounds noted in localized lung fields are the result of lower airways processes, such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or atelectasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rales </strong>&ndash; Also known as crackles are typically high-pitched sounds heard during inspiration, often late phase, as deflated small airways reinflate. Inspiratory rales are heard in conditions, such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia or pulmonary edema. They may be particularly audible with the deep inspiration or crying. Rales may also be heard during expiration due to intrathoracic obstruction caused by conditions, such as bronchiolitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis and lower airway foreign body and are more pronounced by having infants and children exhale forcefully as if blowing out candles. Rales that clear with coughing are usually not significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rhonchi </strong>&ndash; Also referred to as coarse rales, rhonchi are harsh, low-pitched, rattling sounds heard during inspiration, or expiration due to airway obstruction from secretions, edema, or inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Bronchophony, pectoriloquy, and egophony </strong>&ndash; With bronchophony spoken diphthong syllables that start as one vowel and change to another, such as &ldquo;toy boat&rdquo; or &ldquo;blue balloon&rdquo;, are heard more distinctly over an area of consolidation. With pectoriloquy, the syllable, when whispered, is louder in the area of consolidation. Egophony is a change in sound, such as &ldquo;ee&rdquo; to &ldquo;ay&rdquo; with consolidation. These findings may be helpful in older, cooperative children but are less reliable findings in children younger than five years of age because breath sounds are easily transmitted throughout the chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pleural rub </strong>&ndash; A pleural rub is a low-pitched, grating sound heard with inspiration and expiration caused by inflammation of pleural surfaces with friction as they move against each other during respiration. A pleural rub may be associated with pneumonia or a lung abscess.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pericardial rub </strong>&ndash; A pericardial rub occurs when inflamed parietal and visceral pericardial surfaces rub against each other. It is heard best between the apex and the sternum. It may be difficult to distinguish from pleural rub.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Hamman&rsquo;s crunch or sign describes pericardial crackles heard near the heart in synchrony with the heartbeat. This finding results from the heart beating against air-filled tissues in patients with pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, tracheobronchial injury, or left sided pneumothorax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpation and percussion</strong> &ndash; The following signs elicited by palpation and percussion of the chest indicate a respiratory tract etiology for respiratory distress:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Crepitus </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Subcutaneous air due to an air leak (eg, pneumothorax) causes crepitus, a crunching sensation beneath the skin during palpation over the neck and chest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Tactile rhonchi </strong>&ndash; Vibratory rhonchi palpated over the large airways suggests the presence of fluid in the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fremitus </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Fremitus is palpable vibration of the thoracic wall. Tactile fremitus, vibration elicited by speaking diphthong phrases, such as &ldquo;toy boat&rdquo; or &ldquo;blue balloons&rdquo;, is focally increased over an area of consolidation and decreased over pneumothorax or pleural effusion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Percussion </strong>&ndash; Hyperresonance with percussion of the chest wall may indicate air trapping in patients with asthma or bronchiolitis or air leak in patients with pneumothorax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Dullness with percussion suggests an area of consolidation (eg, atelectasis, bronchopneumonia, pleural effusion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Level of lung percussion during full inspiration and full expiration, used to assess diaphragmatic movement, suggests air trapping when elevation of the diaphragm is decreased during expiration and intraabdominal distention, or organomegaly when downward movement of the diaphragm is decreased during inspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Other organ systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings in other organ systems can indicate an etiology for the child's respiratory distress other than pulmonary disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children#H13169151\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute respiratory distress in children&quot;, section on 'Other non-traumatic conditions'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central nervous system </strong>&ndash; Altered mental status and abnormal respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pattern may accompany a variety of pulmonary conditions.

Recognize that breath sounds are often transmitted throughout the chest of a small child which may mask focality. Diffuse rales <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheezing suggest viral or atypical pneumonia. The absence of rales or wheezes does not exclude the diagnosis of pneumonia. Chest radiographs often establish the diagnosis although findings may be subtle or absent in patients with a short duration of illness and infiltrate may be difficult to distinguish from atelectasis.

Typical clinical features include fever, nasal congestion, increased secretions, and retractions with diffuse wheezing and scattered rales. While chest radiograph is not recommended for diagnosis, focal consolidation on radiograph, particularly in patients with high fever and focal findings on exam is concerning for bacterial superinfection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Asthma with a febrile illness </strong>&ndash; A child with asthma who has fever and wheezing may have pneumonia. Respiratory tract infections that do not generally cause respiratory distress (ie, the common cold) may trigger an exacerbation in children with asthma. A chest radiograph to evaluate for pneumonia should be considered for patients with an asthma exacerbation and fever &ge;38.9&deg;C (102&deg;F), particularly when breath sounds remain consistently asymmetric despite treatment of bronchospasm.

Coxsackie B is the most common cause of myocarditis in children. Tachypnea may be the only respiratory indication of heart involvement. Rales suggest pulmonary edema. Tachycardia with or without respiratory findings, particularly if unresponsive to fluids should increase suspicion for myocarditis. A new cardiac murmur or gallop may also be present. Elevated troponin and characteristic findings on electrocardiogram and echocardiograph help confirm the diagnosis.

Chlamydia pneumonia may be preceded by conjunctivitis. Treatment of conjunctivitis with systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">erythromycin</a> usually prevents pneumonia. Patients with atypical pneumonia typically have staccato cough with chlamydia and dry cough with mycoplasma. These patients may also have shortness of breath, chest tightness, rales and wheezes. Fever may or may not be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia caused by Chlamydia species in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Atelectasis</strong> &ndash; The physical findings of atelectasis in children tend to be minimal. In most cases, there are no changes in the physical exam although occasionally fever may be present. As an example, in the setting of asthma and compressive right middle lobe atelectasis, the upper and lower lobes will fill the space occupied by the collapsed lobe so that breath sounds can be normal in the right axilla. Crackles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheezes may be heard over areas of obstructive atelectasis if the airway obstruction is incomplete and allows some airflow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atelectasis-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atelectasis in children&quot;, section on 'Physical findings'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Bronchiolitis</strong> &ndash; Children with bronchiolitis may have wheezes, rales <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rhonchi and be afebrile. Focal opacity on chest radiograph in afebrile patients with bronchiolitis may be due to atelectasis or bacterial superinfection.

Children with severe symptoms should receive aggressive pharmacologic therapy, as well as evaluation for associated conditions, including pneumothorax or pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-emergency-department-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute asthma exacerbations in children: Emergency department management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; Anaphylaxis can cause bronchospasm, as well as upper airway obstruction. Exposure to a known trigger, facial edema, and an urticarial rash are also common features. The treatment of is provided in the table and discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 6</a>).

Causes including upper airway obstruction, severe central nervous system insult, submersion injury, acute salicylate toxicity, and pulmonary irritants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Chronic pulmonary disease exacerbation</strong> &ndash; Children who are experiencing an exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary disease, such as chronic lung disease or cystic fibrosis, often have respiratory distress with abnormal breath sounds, such as wheezes or rales, along with increased cough and changes in sputum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Foreign body</strong> &ndash; Although breath sounds are classically asymmetric with foreign body in the lower airway, breath sounds may be symmetric because the foreign body is small <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> because breath sounds are transmitted across the chest of small children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Heart failure</strong> &ndash; Children in respiratory distress from heart failure (HF) classically have rales on lung exam, as well as other signs of heart disease, such as abnormal heart sounds and organomegaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Heart failure is often due to a congenital defect, some of which result in severe hypoxia and cyanosis while others present only with poor feeding and failure to thrive. Neonates with obstructive left heart lesions, such as severe coarctation of the aorta can develop severe HF when the ductus arteriosus closes. HF can also develop as the result of an arrhythmia, most commonly supraventricular tachycardia. In addition, children with myocarditis (from either an infectious or a noninfectious etiology, such as an autoimmune disorder) may have HF and be afebrile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56995 \">table 7</a>). Electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and echocardiography help to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suggestive clinical findings.

The presence of fever suggests an infectious etiology within or outside the respiratory system, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pneumonia</strong> &ndash; Breath sounds may be normal with lobar pneumonia or empyema, particularly in small children. Etiology may be bacterial or viral. Decreased pulse oximetry or abnormalities on chest radiographs help to establish the diagnosis.

In febrile children with respiratory compromise, atelectasis may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia on bedside ultrasound or chest radiograph. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Sepsis</strong> &ndash; Respiratory distress manifested as tachypnea may occur in patients with severe sepsis to compensate for metabolic acidosis. Respiratory status may be further compromised as the result of capillary leak in the lungs.

Agents of biologic warfare, particularly nerve gases often impact children first because these gases are heavier than air, thus more concentrated at the level at which children breath, and because children breath more rapidly than adults. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Intrapulmonary mass</strong> &ndash; Children with tumor, bronchogenic cyst, or congenital diaphragmatic hernia may present with isolated tachypnea as an initial or later finding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Spontaneous pneumothorax</strong> &ndash; Risk factors for spontaneous pneumothorax include tall thin body habitus, asthma, and high intrapulmonary pressure generated by smoking drugs, particularly marijuana. Clinical findings include chest pain, decreased breath sounds on the affected side, and hyperresonance to percussion. An upright chest radiograph supports clinical findings. Bedside ultrasound can also be useful for prompt diagnosis.

Fever is often, but not always present. Pulmonary embolism is rare in children, occurring most commonly in adolescents. Risk factors for pulmonary embolism include surgery, trauma, immobility, obesity, pregnancy, central vascular access devices, an underlying hypercoagulable inherited or acquired condition, heart, kidney or autoimmune disease, DIC, malignancy and medications, most notably birth control medications.

Cardiac conditions that cause heart failure include congenital lesions, myocarditis, and arrhythmias. Heart sounds may be normal or abnormal depending upon the underlying cardiac condition. Pain as the result of pericarditis may result in splinting with respiration. Cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin), electrocardiogram and, in selected settings, echocardiography can be helpful in establishing a specific diagnosis.
