A complete pelvic examination and focused general physical examination are performed, with particular attention to the vulva, vaginal introitus, perineum, anus, and inguinofemoral lymph nodes. Women who are elderly or have medical comorbidities may require preoperative medical consultation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Imaging studies, or a laboratory evaluation (with the exception of a pregnancy test, if appropriate), are generally not required.</p><p>Biopsy of the vulvar lesion is required to determine the histology and appropriate treatment.

There are no guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis of surgical site infection for these procedures. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises the use of prophylactic antibiotics for vaginal colporrhaphy, for which the risks are likely similar to vulvar excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>We suggest use of prophylactic antibiotics for simple vulvectomy, skinning vulvectomy, and vulvar wide local excision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7472902\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboprophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Chest Physicians does not recommend thromboprophylaxis for minor surgery in low-risk patients, but early and frequent ambulation is advised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Women who undergo skinning or simple vulvectomy require a period of postoperative bed rest or limited ambulation (see <a href=\"#H1063596\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> below). There are no data regarding the effect of bed rest on gynecologic surgery patients, but a review of population-based studies of medical patients who were immobilized reported a fivefold risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Although it is uncertain whether women with limited activity following vulvar excision have the same potential for thromboembolism as an immobilized medical patient population, we suggest thromboprophylaxis during the postoperative period following simple or skinning vulvectomy.</p><p>Options for thromboprophylaxis are discussed separately.

The patient is positioned in dorsal lithotomy and sterilely prepared and draped in the normal fashion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7472483\"><span class=\"h1\">WIDE LOCAL EXCISION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of the term &quot;wide&quot; is a misnomer because the extent of resection margin and depth of resection depends upon several factors, including the likelihood or presence of invasive cancer, and the size and location of the lesion.</p><p>When excising a totally benign lesion the margin of normal skin around can be close, but for a malignant or potentially malignant lesion margins are more important. In the case of a lesion that is suspicious for cancer (due to either documented severe vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or by appearance), it can be excised circumferentially with the aim of achieving up to a 2 cm margin with the depth of excision extending into the underlying adipose tissue or to the deep fascia depending on the circumstances. Small lateralized vulvar carcinomas can be excised in similar fashion but with resection taken down to the deep fascia. This form of wide local excision for cancer is sometimes termed radical local excision.</p><p>Depending on patient wishes and bearing in mind the lesion diagnosis, the margin of resection may also vary according to anatomic location to avoid disruption of vulvar architecture and quality of life. For preinvasive disease, a margin of &lt;1 cm may be taken in order to avoid damage to the clitoris or urethra or distortion of the vulva. If a small margin is planned and there is concern that the entire lesion will not be excised, ablation of the surrounding skin may be performed.</p><p>The shape of the excision should be elliptical, running in the longest axis parallel to neighboring structures. Thus, for lesions on the labia majora the ellipse would be anterior-posterior. Lesions close to the vaginal introitus are often better excised with the ellipse running around the line of the introitus. Marking the planned incision with a pen is helpful in planning the extent and axis. Estimation of histologic margins must take into account tissue shrinkage during fixation.</p><p>The defect may be reapproximated with interrupted or running synthetic absorbable suture. A small suction drain may be placed.</p><p>Postoperative care consists of keeping the wound clean and dry. There are no data regarding the incidence of complications following vulvar wide local excision, but in our experience, they are rare. Potential complications include infection, excessive bleeding, hematoma, and scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063525\"><span class=\"h1\">SIMPLE VULVECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple, or total, vulvectomy refers to removal of the entire vulva together, usually including some subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The perineal tissues are removed, if indicated. The clitoris is removed only if this is mandated by the extent of disease and ablation is not possible. Partial or hemivulvectomy can sometimes be performed to tailor the surgery to the disease and patient, maintain body image, and preserve sexual function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063550\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A simple vulvectomy is performed for benign or premalignant conditions of the vulva that are extensive or multifocal and are not amenable to removal with local excision alone. The procedure is typically reserved for older patients in whom preservation of vulvar contour and sexual function is not paramount.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063575\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063582\"><span class=\"h3\">Vulvectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bladder catheter is placed. The incision is planned, leaving as much skin of the vaginal vestibule surrounding the urethra as possible (1 cm or more) to facilitate closure and avoid distortion of the urethral meatus. The line of resection laterally depends upon the extent of disease, but may include all of the labia majora. The clitoris is spared, if possible. The internal and external resection margins are marked prior to incisions being made (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67406\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67406 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The posterior incision is made first. The incision is made across the skin of the perineum and then laterally up to the level of the urethra. Stretching the vulvar skin to create a flat surface facilitates making the incision.</p><p>The posterior edge of the specimen is grasped with forceps. This allows the operator to elevate the skin and stretch it out using two fingers placed behind the flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78418\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78418 \">figure 4</a>). Dissecting scissors, scalpel, or electrocautery is then used to carefully separate the skin from the underlying perineal tissues to a level beyond the intended vaginal margin. Mobilization of the lower vagina above the intended resection margin will help with closure. Care must be taken to avoid damaging the rectum during dissection.</p><p>The incision is then extended anteriorly and laterally on both sides. The lateral skin edges of the specimen are grasped with forceps and sharp dissection is performed (using curved Mayo scissors or a scalpel, or electrosurgery if the lesion is benign), staying within the subcutaneous fat and aiming for the resection margin in the vagina. It is not necessary to resect deeply. An assistant should be ready with hemostats and an electrosurgical instrument to control bleeding.</p><p>The specimen is then detached from the distal vagina laterally and posteriorly. Scissors are used to cut radially through the specimen to the vaginal margin, and the specimen is separated on both sides to a point level with, but lateral to, the upper part of the urethral meatus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78360 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p>If excision of the clitoris is planned, the dissection is taken down from above toward the clitoral attachments. The suspensory ligament is divided and ligated. The scalpel is used to incise the skin across the vestibule above and lateral to the urethral meatus, joining with the internal incision around the distal vagina. The tip of the scalpel or the Kelly forceps is then passed through the specimen in the midline to isolate the crura of the clitoris and to allow the crura to be held on each side with forceps, divided, and underrun with 0 polyglactin sutures. The specimen is then completely detached and hemostasis is obtained with an electrosurgical instrument. Bleeding from venous sinuses around the urethra and vaginal margin may be controlled with a running 2-0 polyglactin suture.</p><p>It is helpful to mark the orientation of the specimen for the pathologist and to draw a diagram on the pathology form marking the sites of disease, if these are not clearly apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063589\"><span class=\"h3\">Closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An assessment is made of how best to reapproximate the tissue edges. The patient's legs may be adducted to reduce tension on the repair. If it appears the edges may be under too much tension when brought together, the lateral and posterior vagina and skin edges may be further undermined. When undermining vulvar skin, care must be taken to leave sufficient subcutaneous tissue attached to prevent devascularization. It is best to start by freeing up the lateral and posterior vaginal edges. Local skin flaps may be required. Small open areas may be allowed to granulate.</p><p>We use undyed 3-0 polyglactin for closure. Closure is started by inserting a stay suture to approximate the skin immediately above the urethral meatus. The approximation of the skin edges is done later. Prior to each stitch being placed around the introitus, it should be assured that the closure is being performed evenly and that a difficult to close area will not be left until the last, when it may be too late to correct without revising sutures.</p><p>A suction drain is brought out on each side of the perineum and sutured to the skin. When suction is applied, leakage of air may occur around the incision and extra sutures may need to be inserted. Leakage often only stops when the patient&rsquo;s legs are brought together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063596\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bladder catheter is left in place for up to seven days. In our practice, we allow the patient to be out of bed and to move to a chair at an early stage, but not to walk freely. Stair climbing and abduction of the legs are prohibited. Thromboprophylaxis is employed. (See <a href=\"#H7472902\" class=\"local\">'Thromboprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p>The sutures may be trimmed after seven days if they are causing irritation. Perineal hygiene with sitz baths and gentle cleansing with saline rinse are encouraged, usually followed by carefully drying the area with a dryer. Exposure to the air is helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063618\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are not data regarding the incidence of complications following simple vulvectomy. In our experience, hematoma formation is rarely a problem, provided the suction drains are functioning. Infection is usually noted soon after the surgery and should be treated with antibiotics and continued perineal hygiene. Small separations of the wound may occur and can be left to heal spontaneously. Wide separation is unusual, but can also generally be left to heal by secondary intention. Stricture of the introitus is not usually a problem following this procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">SKINNING VULVECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skinning vulvectomy refers to a procedure in which the vulvar skin is removed and replaced with a split-thickness skin graft. The vulvar skin is removed along a relatively avascular plane beneath the epidermis, while preserving the subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. This procedure preserves the contours of the vulva, which are derived from the underlying subcutaneous fat and fascia. A partial resection with a graft is possible in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skinning vulvectomy is rarely indicated and is reserved for extensive vulvar intraepithelial lesions that are either multifocal or large and confluent. It is used in the small proportion of patients in whom prior treatments such as topical treatments, laser ablation, or smaller excisions have failed to control disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The excision margins are marked with a pen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53387\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53387 \">figure 6</a>) and the skin is incised down and through the dermis to the superficial fascia overlying the fat pads, but no deeper. Use of this depth preserves the contours of the vulva. Keeping tension on either side of the incision facilitates this procedure.</p><p>The skin edges are grasped and elevated with forceps and the skin is dissected off the subcutaneous tissues, keeping close to the underside of the dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78802\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78802 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74931 \">figure 8</a>). If the disease is present on the clitoris and clitoral hood, these structures can be preserved and treated with laser ablation.</p><p>A split-thickness skin graft is taken from the inner thigh and meshed in order to increase the area that can be covered and prevent clot and exudate accumulating under the graft. It is important to obtain good hemostasis before the graft is applied. The undersurface of the graft is applied to the defect and the edges secured to the wound edges using 3-0 polyglactin over dental rolls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69982\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69982 \">figure 9</a>). Paraffin gauze is laid over the graft and cotton dressings are secured over the top to maintain apposition. A few sutures are left long on each side to use for tying down the dressing at the end of the procedure. Paraffin gauze and dressings are placed over the donor site on the thigh, which is then wrapped in a crepe bandage. Excess skin is refrigerated in case the first graft does not take completely.</p><p>A bladder catheter is placed at the end of the procedure and left in place until the graft has taken, usually about seven days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activity for the first seven days is restricted to bed rest or sitting in chair. Thromboprophylaxis is employed. (See <a href=\"#H7472902\" class=\"local\">'Thromboprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p>The vulvar dressings are inspected daily, but not taken down for five days unless there are signs of infection. On the fifth postoperative day, analgesia is given and then the dressings are removed. General anesthesia is necessary for some women. If the dressings are adherent to the graft and adjacent skin, they should be treated with warm saline to facilitate removal.</p><p>If the graft has taken at this stage, the wound can be left open. It should be kept clean with saline rinse or sitz bath and kept dry with a hair dryer. If the skin graft has not taken, it should be debrided followed by application of the stored extra skin.</p><p>The donor site (inner thigh) dressing is left in place for two weeks, unless it shows signs of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skinning vulvectomy is a safe procedure. Combined data from several studies show complications in 7 of 103 women (6.8 percent) following skinning vulvectomy, including: graft sloughing, partial (one patient) or complete (one patient); fever (three patients); and dyspareunia related to slow healing of the introital area and introital narrowing (two patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061952\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349229150\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence of VIN after excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) following treatment is frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].

Such effects appear to be minimal in women who have undergone vulvar local excision with a margin of &le;1 cm, while some data suggest effects on sexual function with margins &gt;1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The effect of simple or skinning vulvectomy on sexual function has not been well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Treatment planning and patient counseling should include the potential for effects on sexual function and body image. The least invasive treatment that will minimize risk of invasive disease should be chosen. Women who have had vulvar surgery should be advised about possible sexual sequelae, and questions regarding sexual health should be included in postoperative care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4287580\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative excisional procedures are most often performed for biopsy and treatment of benign or premalignant conditions of the vulva, including vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), Paget disease, or dermatologic conditions. (See <a href=\"#H7472463\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest use of prophylactic antibiotics for simple, skinning vulvectomy, and wide local excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7472855\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who undergo skinning or simple total vulvectomy require a period of bed rest or limited ambulation. We suggest thromboprophylaxis for these patients during the postoperative period (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7472902\" class=\"local\">'Thromboprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local excision is generally performed when one or two focal lesions are present. The extent of the margin depends upon diagnosis, the potential for invasive disease, and the anatomic location of the lesion. The depth of the excision is full thickness of the skin along with the underlying subcutaneous adipose tissue, to ensure there is no invasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H7472483\" class=\"local\">'Wide local excision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple vulvectomy refers to removal of the entire vulva together with perineal skin and usually includes some subcutaneous tissue. (See <a href=\"#H1063525\" class=\"local\">'Simple vulvectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A simple vulvectomy may be performed for extensive benign conditions of the vulva, such as intractable symptomatic lichen sclerosus. It may also be indicated in extensive Paget disease and in older patients with severe widespread VIN. (See <a href=\"#H1063550\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of simple vulvectomy include hematoma formation, infection, and wound separation. (See <a href=\"#H1063618\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skinning vulvectomy refers to a procedure in which the vulvar skin only is removed, to retain the normal contours of the vulva, and replaced with a split-thickness skin graft. This procedure is rarely performed and is reserved for extensive VIN lesions that are either multifocal or large and confluent in women who have failed other treatments. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Skinning vulvectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of skinning vulvectomy include graft sloughing, infection, or scarring. Scarring around the introitus may cause dyspareunia, which can be treated by gradual dilation or revision.
