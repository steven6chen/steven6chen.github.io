The primary hereditary neuropathies predominantly affect peripheral nerves and produce symptoms of peripheral nerve dysfunction. Other hereditary neuropathies affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems and, in some cases, other organs; in such patients, symptoms related to the peripheral neuropathy may be overshadowed by additional manifestations of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74269%7EPEDS%2F72307%7EPEDS%2F56567%7EPEDS%2F52324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74269 graphicRef72307 graphicRef56567 graphicRef52324 \">table 1A-D</a>).</p><p>The last group of disorders is reviewed here.

A peripheral neuropathy is described in some but not all (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74269\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74269 \">table 1A</a>). Peripheral neuropathy has been best characterized in SCA4, in which a prominent axonal neuropathy is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is considered one of several subtypes of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation'</a>.)</p><p>The classification of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy has been evolving since the discovery that nearly 80 percent of children with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy have mutations in the PLA2G6 gene with a locus on chromosome 22q13.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene have also been detected in patients previously diagnosed with other subtypes of NBIA, and it now appears that the PLA2G6 mutation is associated with a characteristic clinical and radiologic phenotype called PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy typically present by two to three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a series of 14 children with PLAN, the median age of symptom presentation was 14 months (range 12 to 22 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of these, five died at median age of nine years (range 6.5 to 14 years).</p><p>Symptoms related to infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy reflect involvement of the peripheral nerves, central nervous system, and autonomic nervous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72307 \">table 1B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The peripheral neuropathy is characterized by loss of distal sensation, which may lead to limb mutilation and muscle atrophy. Hypotonia and loss of motor milestones are associated with early onset of the disease. Deep tendon reflexes typically are hypoactive.</p><p>Central nervous system manifestations include cognitive deterioration, spasticity, optic atrophy, and hypothalamic dysfunction with diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Autonomic symptoms may include urinary retention, decreased tearing, and dysfunction of temperature regulation. Early studies reported rare seizures in children with late-onset neuroaxonal dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], but seizures have not been reported in children with PLA2G6 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Electromyography shows signs of chronic denervation; fast rhythms may be present on electroencephalography and visual evoked potentials are usually abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be suggestive of the diagnosis. Cerebellar atrophy and gliosis is universally present, with increased signal on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted MRI sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/7,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,13</a>]. Other common MRI findings include hypointensity of the globus pallidus, dentate nuclei, substantia nigra on high susceptibility gradient echo (T2*) sequences, and hypointensity of the globus pallidus on fast spin echo sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic findings, which are seen best by electron microscopy, are similar in the peripheral, central, and autonomic nervous systems. Spheroids containing mitochondria, glycogen-like granules, and dense bodies occur in both central and peripheral nerve fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Spheroid formation leads to axonal swelling.</p><p>Other abnormalities in the central nervous system include cerebellar atrophy with neuronal atrophy and astrogliosis and involvement of the corticospinal tracts. Immunohistochemistry reveals the presence of ubiquitin but not beta-tuberculin or beta-amyloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

An abnormal conjunctival biopsy is not dependent upon the presence of optic atrophy. Where available, PLA2G6 mutation analysis may confirm the diagnosis in patients with PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy includes other subtypes of NBIA, as these exhibit broad phenotypic overlap.

HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages and intracellular lipid trafficking are impaired in this disorder, leading to the presence of foam cells in macrophages and other cells of the reticuloendothelial system throughout the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72307 \">table 1B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The defect in Tangier disease appears to involve mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene on chromosome 9q31, which encodes for the cholesterol efflux regulatory protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/19,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-24</a>].

Possible future therapies involve pharmacologic manipulation of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway such as: increasing cellular ABC1 expression to augment cellular efflux of cholesterol to HDL; preventing the catabolism of HDL without interfering with its cholesterol transport function; or increasing the rate of hepatic HDL cholesterol uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ABETALIPOPROTEINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroacanthocytosis#H1983214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroacanthocytosis&quot;, section on 'Abetalipoproteinemia'</a>). It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. The neurologic manifestations result from the inability to absorb and transport <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> and include progressive ataxia, sensory-motor neuropathy, and vision impairment with retinitis pigmentosa. Other clinical manifestations include acanthocytosis along with fat malabsorption and steatorrhea. </p><p>The diagnosis is made in the setting of the typical clinical findings accompanied by laboratory findings of acanthocytosis, very low triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, and absent beta-lipoproteins. Neurologic manifestations can be prevented and partially reversed with the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) along with other fat soluble vitamins.

Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles that catalyze numerous functions in cellular metabolism. A group of genetic diseases in which impairment in one or more peroxisomal functions exists is expanding. The peroxisomal disorders usually are classified into three groups according to the presence or absence of intact peroxisomes and whether one or more than one peroxisomal enzyme or function is affected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peroxisomal-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peroxisomal disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Refsum disease has been classified into classic and infantile forms; both are associated with abnormal phytanic acid accumulation. Classic Refsum disease (heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with the accumulation of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues. Phytanic acid is a branched-chain fatty acid present in the typical human diet. Normally it is metabolized by activation to its CoA ester, phytanoyl-CoA, and then alpha-oxidation to pristanic acid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72307 \">table 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peroxisomal-disorders#H40\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peroxisomal disorders&quot;, section on 'Refsum disease'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with Refsum disease are unable to degrade phytanic acid because of deficient activity of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, a peroxisomal enzyme that catalyzes the first step of phytanic acid alpha-oxidation; this abnormality is caused by mutations in the PHYH gene that lead to an enzymatically inactive protein.</p><p>A small number of patients with classic adult Refsum disease have defects involving the PEX7 gene rather than the PHYH gene. The PEX7 gene encodes the peroxin 7 receptor protein, which is required for peroxisomal import of proteins, and which plays a role in the incorporation of PhyH into peroxisomes. Defects in the PEX7 gene are also found in another hereditary disorder, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peroxisomal-disorders#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peroxisomal disorders&quot;, section on 'Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1'</a>.)</p><p>A different defect is present in infantile Refsum disease, which is one of a group of lethal peroxisome biogenesis disorders (the others being Zellweger syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy). This disorder is characterized by mutations in PEX1 or PEX6, which encode for members of the AAA protein family (ATPases associated with multiple cellular activities).

Peripheral nerve biopsy reveals hypertrophic changes with onion bulb formation and paracrystalline inclusions on electron microscopy.</p><p>The diagnosis usually is made clinically and can be confirmed by measurement of serum phytanic acid concentrations. Strict reduction in dietary phytanic acid intake may be associated with a significant improvement in the clinical manifestations in patients with classic Refsum disease. Another method to reduce serum phytanic acid in these patients is plasmapheresis, which can be performed serially if necessary.</p><p>Refsum disease is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

They are missense mutations in the subunit genes for the subunits of the electron transport chain complexes I, III, and IV. The three primary LHON mutations appear to cause profound impairment of complex I-dependent ATP synthesis, suggesting that they result in a common disease-causing mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, the pathogenesis remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. At least 15 other secondary mutations have been identified, but their pathogenicity is unclear; they may serve as exacerbating genetic factors.</p><p>LHON typically produces severe and permanent visual loss and predominantly affects males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The initial symptoms include visual dysfunction with blurring of vision and loss of central vision, most often beginning in the late teens. However, variability in the age of onset, spectrum of clinical expression, and outcome exists. In one series of 72 patients with the 11778 mutation, 82 percent were males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

These factors include an additional X locus, impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, mtDNA heteroplasmy, environmental factors, and autoimmunity.</p><p>Among environmental factors, smoking and alcohol intake may influence the expression of disease.

Additional findings that can occur in children include an extrapyramidal syndrome, seizures, ataxia, spasticity, intellectual disability (mental retardation), and peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral neuropathy is not uniformly present and is not well-described in the literature, but when it occurs, it is typically in the setting of the 11778 mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Homozygotes have severe sun sensitivity that leads to degeneration of regions of the skin and eyes, leading to various forms of cutaneous malignancy. Mutations in eight genes have been identified. Seven of these genes (ie, XPA to XPG) are involved in nucleotide excision repair of carcinogen adducts after UV irradiation, while the other (ie, XPV) is involved in error-free replication of DNA damaged by UV irradiation.

The syndrome is characterized by severe physical and mental retardation, short stature, microcephaly, progressive neurologic dysfunction caused by demyelination, retinal degeneration with a pigmented retinopathy and optic atrophy, kyphoscoliosis, gait defects, and sun sensitivity but no increased frequency of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In 13 cases confirmed with biochemical assays (unscheduled DNA synthesis and recovery of RNA synthesis in skin fibroblasts after exposure to UV irradiation), there was wide variation in the clinical manifestations ranging from prenatal features to normal psychomotor development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>These observations suggest that Cockayne syndrome should be considered in children with growth retardation, microcephaly, and one of the characteristic features (eg, sunken eyes, limb ataxia, abnormal auditory evoked responses, or increased ventricular size and white matter changes on neuroimaging).</p><p>Various polyneuropathies have been described in Cockayne syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], but the most common form is a sensorimotor demyelinating polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Affected patients have white matter demyelination in the central nervous system, with atrophy of the cerebrum and cerebellum.

The ERCC8 (CSA) gene encodes a WD repeat protein, which interacts with the CSB protein encoded by the ERCC6 gene to enhance the transcription factor II subunit of RNA polymerase II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. The CSB protein is a helicase involved in the preferential repair of active genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>As in xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome (CS) cells are hypersensitive to the lethal effects of UV light, but nucleotide excision repair of the bulk of genomic DNA is unaffected. CS cells are defective in a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair, known as transcription-coupled repair, whereby damage in the transcribed strand of active genes is rapidly and preferentially repaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].
