They occur in approximately 0.1 to 1 percent of transfusions. </p><p>The following factors affect the likelihood of an FNHTR: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient age</strong> &ndash; FNHTRs are more frequent in children than adults. In a 2015 study involving over 100,000 transfusions, the rate of FNHTR was 0.2 percent in children and 0.05 percent in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood product</strong> &ndash; FNHTRs can occur with any product; overall, they are equally likely from platelets and red blood cells, and more likely with either of these cellular products than with plasma products (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94399 \">table 1</a>). They are most likely with platelets prepared from platelet-rich plasma (ie, whole blood-derived platelets, as opposed to apheresis platelets), since these platelet products have the highest concentration of leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leukoreduction</strong> &ndash; FNHTRs are much less likely if the product has undergone prestorage leukoreduction. Bedside leukoreduction may slightly decrease the risk, but prestorage leukoreduction is more effective.</p><p/><p>Data from 1962 (the original article about FNHTRs), which were reviewed in 2010, indicate that 40 percent of patients experiencing an FNHTR will experience a subsequent FNHTR, with 24 percent having a recurrent FNHTR on the very next transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, there is no evidence to support the use of prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or antihistamines to prevent these reactions. </p><p>Prevention of FNHTRs and the benefits of leukoreduction in reducing the risk of FNHTR are discussed below and separately. (See <a href=\"#H1934216\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of FNHTR'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1933432\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of FNHTR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNHTRs are commonly caused by cytokines that are generated and accumulate during the storage of blood components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Implicated cytokines include interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&alpha;). </p><p>The role of leukocytes in the stored product as a potential source of cytokines was illustrated in the Trial to Reduce Alloimmunization to Platelets (TRAP), in which FNHTRs were significantly associated with products containing more than 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> leukocytes per transfusion and with components stored for more than 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The relative importance of cytokines rather than the leukocytes themselves was illustrated in a study in which 64 platelet concentrates were separated into cellular and plasma components, and then these were transfused into 12 volunteers in random order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There were 20 reactions to the plasma supernatant, six reactions to the cells, and eight reactions to both products. There was a strong correlation between FNHTRs and the concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 in the plasma. Cytokines can be released from leukocytes that were not removed prior to storage of the blood product (ie, products that did not undergo prestorage leukoreduction), which explains the greater benefit of prestorage leukoreduction in reducing the risk of FNHTR compared with bedside leukoreduction.</p><p>The importance of the duration of product storage in cytokine accumulation has been demonstrated in several studies. As an example, in a series that evaluated reactions to 117 red blood cell transfusions and 65 platelet transfusions, the dominant factors determining the risk of a reaction were a longer duration of product storage and a higher number of leukocytes in the product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In another report, the mean IL-8 concentration increased 100-fold between days 2 and 5 of storage and rose further with continued storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Alternative mechanisms for FNHTR reactions have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FNHTRs have been associated with antibodies directed against class I HLA antigens present on leukocytes in red cell concentrates, or, less commonly, antibodies to platelet or granulocyte antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]; however, such antibodies are not always found.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FNHTRs accompanying platelet transfusions have also been associated with release of platelet-derived CD154 (CD40 ligand), which is capable of inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines from fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5851821\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis of FNHTR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of FNHTR occur within one to six hours after initiation of a transfusion; these include fever, often a chill, occasionally severe rigors (most often seen with, though not restricted to, granulocyte transfusions), and sometimes mild dyspnea. The temperature increase is typically in the range of 1 to 2&deg;C. A temperature increase of &lt;1&deg;C is not considered clinically significant, while an increase of &gt;2&deg;C is more suggestive of an acute hemolytic or septic transfusion reaction, providing that a non-transfusion-related infection can be excluded. </p><p>FNHTRs are diagnosed clinically by excluding other causes of fever in a patient receiving a transfusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96323 \">algorithm 1</a>). There is no laboratory or other testing that can confirm or exclude the presence of an FNHTR. The extent of the evaluation for other causes depends on the severity of the temperature increase and the presence or absence of other symptoms. As an example, a patient with fever, hypotension, and back pain should have a full evaluation for hemolytic transfusion reaction and possibly sepsis, whereas an individual with isolated mild fever may have a physical examination, clerical check of the transfusion, and visual inspection of the blood product. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other transfusion reactions associated with fever include acute hemolytic reactions and sepsis. Unlike FNHTRs, individuals with acute hemolysis or sepsis are acutely ill, and have laboratory findings of free hemoglobin in blood and urine or visual red or dark color in blood and urine, and bacteremia, respectively. Both acute hemolysis and sepsis can also be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is not seen with FNHTRs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other transfusion reactions associated with dyspnea include transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and anaphylactic reactions. Unlike FNHTRs, individuals with TACO and TRALI have evidence of pulmonary edema on physical examination and chest radiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939 \">table 2</a>), and individuals with anaphylactic reactions have wheezing and sometimes other findings such as hypotension or angioedema. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of FNHTR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNHTRs are benign, causing no lasting sequelae, but they are uncomfortable and sometimes frightening to the patient. Furthermore, since fever may be the sign of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or infection, FNHTRs require action on the part of the clinical team. This typically involves the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping of the transfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of antipyretics if the fever is bothersome to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for other causes of fever, which include more serious (and potentially life-threatening) transfusion reactions as well as non-transfusion-related infection or fever. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital admission (if the transfusion is administered in an out-patient setting) for presumptive treatment of infection, if this is considered to have high enough likelihood (eg, in a patient with functional asplenia from sickle cell disease). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of other medications, if needed, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> (25 to 50 mg) for severe chills or rigors, which may characterize any FNHTR but are most often precipitated by a granulocyte transfusion. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1934216\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of FNHTR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major means of preventing FNHTRs is pre-storage leukoreduction of the product (ie, removing most of the white blood cells by passing the cellular blood products through a filter shortly after the collection or using an apheresis collection technology with effective leukoreduction). This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do <strong>not</strong> use premedications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>) to decrease the incidence of FNHTRs as they are ineffective and may cause adverse events on their own such as cardiovascular symptoms and central nervous system alterations. This practice of avoiding premedication is supported by a randomized trial in 315 patients with hematologic or oncologic conditions who required a transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (500 mg) plus diphenhydramine (25 mg) or placebos 30 minutes before transfusion, and monitored for four hours. There was no significant difference in transfusion reactions between the treatment and placebo groups (1.4 versus 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">reactions/100</span> transfusions, respectively). A review of available studies from 2007 also found no evidence to support premedication; this included six studies, mostly retrospective, encompassing 432,556 evaluable transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLACTIC TRANSFUSION REACTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664430507\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence and mechanisms of anaphylactic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylactic transfusion reactions are rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 50,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>Anaphylaxis results from sudden (typically massive) systemic release of mediators such as histamine and tryptase by mast cells and basophils, typically in response to an IgE-mediated (or IgG-mediated) immune reaction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anaphylaxis can occur with transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, granulocytes, or plasma products (eg, Fresh Frozen Plasma [FFP], Cryoprecipitate, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [IVIG]). These reactions are not seen with plasma derivatives (albumin, purified clotting factors). Typically, the reaction occurs because the transfused product contains a substance to which the recipient is allergic; the converse has also been reported (ie, the reaction occurs because the transfused product contains IgE that reacts with a substance in the recipient).</p><p>Several specific mechanisms and the clinical settings in which they occur have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A well-characterized mechanism is class-specific IgG anti-IgA antibodies in patients who are IgA deficient. Selective IgA deficiency is common, occurring in about 1 in 300 to 500 people. However, few IgA-deficient patients develop anti-IgA antibodies (eg, 1 in 1200 to 1600 IgA-deficient patients have anti-IgA antibodies). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis#H6475461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective IgA deficiency: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Reactions to blood products'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaphylaxis has been described after blood product transfusion in patients with anhaptoglobinemia (ie, congenital deficiency of haptoglobin) who develop anti-haptoglobin antibodies; this disorder primarily occurs in East Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe laryngeal edema or bronchospasm can occur in recipients of plasma exchange, occurring in 1 in every 500 to 1000 plasma exchanges in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Some of these reactions may be due to hypersensitivity to ethylene oxide or other substances used to sterilize components of the apheresis kit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Anaphylaxis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, used as a pathogen inactivation agent, has also been reported, although this is not likely to be a common cause of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood donor was found whose transfused blood components (platelets) were implicated in two cases of anaphylactic transfusion reaction in 2002. The donor plasma showed mast cell degranulation activity due to the presence of high molecular weight (dimeric and trimeric) IgEs that likely directly activated the recipient's mast cells by crosslinking the immunoglobulin FC-epsilon receptor 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The donor was ultimately diagnosed as having IgE kappa multiple myeloma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In at least one case, an anaphylactic reaction occurred due to passive transfer of a peanut allergen ingested by the blood donor and transfused into a child with a prior anaphylactic reaction to peanuts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7642364\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis of anaphylactic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylactic transfusion reactions are of rapid onset (as are all anaphylactic reactions), typically occurring within a few seconds to a few minutes following initiation of a transfusion. The patient may experience shock, hypotension, angioedema, respiratory distress, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheezing. These may or may not be preceded or accompanied by symptoms commonly described in urticarial transfusion reactions (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Urticarial (allergic) reactions'</a> below) including pruritus, urticaria, and flushing. </p><p>The diagnosis of an anaphylactic transfusion reaction is made clinically based on the timing of the reaction, rapid progression to potentially life-threatening symptomatology, and rapid response to therapy. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of an anaphylactic transfusion reaction includes other causes of dyspnea and hypotension during a transfusion (eg, TRALI, TACO, sepsis), as well as other, non-transfusion-related allergic conditions (eg, asthma, drug allergy). Unlike anaphylactic reactions, these other reactions (TRALI, TACO, and sepsis) are generally not associated with wheezing and angioedema, and they do not resolve rapidly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.</p><p>The typical evaluation of a patient with a moderate to severe anaphylactic reaction, almost always performed after the acute situation has been treated and symptoms resolved (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment and prevention of anaphylactic reactions'</a> below), involves quantitative measuring of IgA levels as well as anti-IgA (if indicated), preferably on a pre-transfusion sample. Mast cell tryptase can be measured if the test is available with a reasonable turnaround time, but the results generally do not alter diagnosis or management when the clinical diagnosis appears obvious.

They are seen in as many as 1 to 3 percent; use of premedications has not appeared to change this incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Urticarial transfusion reactions occur when a soluble substance in the plasma of the donated blood product (or the recipient) reacts with pre-existing IgE antibodies in the recipient (or the product), respectively. Urticarial reactions are thought to be due to mast cell or basophil release of histamine, although other mechanisms may be involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset urticaria&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The major difference between allergic reactions and anaphylactic reactions is of degree; allergic reactions are mild, whereas anaphylactic reactions are associated with massive release of histamine and other mediators. It is not known whether certain mediators are specific for anaphylaxis. </p><p>A commonly cited example of urticarial reactions is donor peanut allergy, with hives in the recipient triggered by recent peanut ingestion by the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. The converse (recipient peanut allergy, with peanut antigen in the donated product) has also been described. </p><p>Non-antibody mechanisms have also been proposed.

The platelet products associated with urticarial transfusion reactions had levels of the direct allergic agonists C5a, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and CCL5 (RANTES) that were 17, 42, and 14 percent higher than the control platelet products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7642810\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis of urticarial reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urticarial reactions present with hives or urticaria, which can occur during, at the end, or shortly after a transfusion. No other allergic findings are present (ie, there is no wheezing, angioedema, or hypotension). This timing differs from anaphylactic reactions, which typically occur within minutes of starting a transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H7642364\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and diagnosis of anaphylactic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>Urticarial reactions are diagnosed clinically when a patient develops hives or urticaria without progression to more severe symptoms, such as those that suggest an anaphylactic reaction.

However, before the remainder of the product can be administered, the transfusion should first be stopped, and, if the urticaria is extensive, 25 to 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> can be given orally or intravenously. If the urticaria wanes and there is no evidence of dyspnea, hypotension, or anaphylaxis, the transfusion may be resumed.</p><p>Rarely, an urticarial reaction may be the first sign of a more serious reaction. If there is evidence of hypotension or respiratory distress, the possibility of anaphylaxis should be evaluated urgently. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>Two small studies suggest that urticarial reactions to platelets can be decreased by washing pooled whole blood-derived platelets and apheresis platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of 179 individuals who first received unmanipulated platelets, and subsequently received platelets from which plasma had been removed by concentrating or washing them, the incidences of allergic transfusion reactions declined from 5.5 percent for the unmanipulated platelets to 1.7 and 0.5 percent for the concentrated and washed platelets, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>These manipulations (removal of plasma, washing) should only be used for patients who experience severe or repeated urticarial reactions that cannot otherwise be prevented. It is appropriate to try concentrating the implicated cells (RBCs or platelets) first (by removing plasma) and only washing the cells if plasma removal does not prevent the urticarial reactions. </p><p>Unlike anaphylactic reactions, urticarial reactions generally are not pursued back to the blood center that obtained the blood component. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1526217027\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMOLYTIC TRANSFUSION REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) are characterized by immune-mediated red blood cell (RBC) destruction (hemolysis). They can be acute (during or within 24 hours after a transfusion) or delayed (days to weeks after a transfusion); and the hemolysis can be intravascular (releasing free hemoglobin into the circulation) or extravascular (resulting in removal of RBCs by the reticuloendothelial system) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111905 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>These reactions are reviewed briefly here and discussed in much greater detail separately.

AHTRs are typically associated with rapid intravascular hemolysis, which can lead to acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hemodynamic collapse; the classic AHTR is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Typical symptoms and findings include fever, chills, back or chest pain, and <span class=\"nowrap\">pink/red</span> serum, plasma or urine, although the full &quot;classic triad&quot; of fever, flank pain, and red urine is rarely seen. In a patient under anesthesia or in a coma, evidence of DIC (oozing from intravenous catheter sites) may be the only finding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">AHTRs are most commonly seen in the setting of ABO blood group incompatibility due to a clerical or procedural error (transfusion of the wrong product); this will become apparent upon clerical check and laboratory testing. If a clerical error is identified, it is critical to notify the transfusion service or hospital blood bank as quickly as possible to prevent another transfusion of the wrong product to another patient (if two patients' products were switched). Additional laboratory evaluation will show evidence of hemolysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional details of the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of AHTR is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DHTR</strong> &ndash; Delayed HTRs (DHTRs) are hemolytic reactions that occur more than 24 hours after completing the transfusion. Often, they occur days to weeks later. DHTRs are typically gradual and less severe; sometimes they are clinically silent. Laboratory findings may include a mild increase in anemia (or failure of the hemoglobin to increase as expected after transfusion) and evidence of extravascular hemolysis, which may include spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear. DHTRs almost always result from an anamnestic response following re-exposure to a foreign RBC antigen such as one from the Kidd or Rh system. Previous exposure may have occurred through transfusion or pregnancy. DHTRs generally do not require any treatment except for future avoidance of transfusions containing the implicated RBC antigen. If a DHTR is accompanied by more brisk hemolysis, more aggressive treatment may be required (ie, as for AHTR). DHTRs are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Delayed hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On rare occasions, a DHTR is accompanied by hemolysis of the patient's own RBCs, a condition termed &quot;hyperhemolysis&quot; or hyperhemolytic crisis. This phenomenon has been seen most often in multiply-transfused patients with sickle cell disease, but it has also been reported in patients with thalassemia and in other settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The mechanism by which such &quot;bystander hemolysis&quot; occurs is not known. This complication and its management are discussed separately.

PTP occurs primarily in women sensitized to platelet antigens by exposure during pregnancy or transfusion; the female-to-male ratio is approximately 26:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. PTP most commonly occurs after exposure to foreign red blood cells (RBCs) but it can be seen with transfusion of any platelet-containing product, including RBCs, platelets, fresh (but not frozen) plasma, or granulocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>PTP can be thought of as a delayed transfusion reaction involving platelets, in which an anamnestic response to a previously encountered foreign platelet antigen leads to an increase in production of anti-platelet antibodies by the recipient. The antigen most commonly implicated is the platelet antigen PlA1, now known as human platelet antigen 1a, (HPA-1a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Unlike a delayed hemolytic reaction, however, these antibodies cause destruction of both the PlA1-positive transfused platelets as well as bystander destruction of the patient's own PlA1-negative platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia. The mechanism by which the antibodies destroy the recipient's own platelets lacking the antigen is not well understood. Possibilities include adsorption of immune complexes onto the patient's own platelets, which are then destroyed, passive acquisition of the antigen from donor plasma, or elaboration of a new autoantibody to another platelet antigen. </p><p>Approximately 97 to 99 percent of Whites and 99 percent of Blacks are PlA1 positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A woman lacking the antigen can be sensitized during pregnancy (ie, upon exposure to the antigen on fetal platelets); women or men lacking the antigen can also be sensitized by prior transfusion. Of note, PlA1 is also the antigen system most commonly implicated in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p>An alternative and even rarer syndrome leading to post-transfusion thrombocytopenia has been reported, in which the recipient of a plasma-containing blood product such as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) develops severe thrombocytopenia, which may be accompanied by bleeding and an acute transfusion reaction, caused by the passive transfer of anti-platelet antibodies (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-HPA-1a/PlA1)</span> from a previously immunized donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The time-course is much more rapid than PTP; thrombocytopenia due to passive antibody transfer occurs in hours rather than days, and recovery typically occurs within five days. Implicated donors are females with a history of pregnancy; these donors should be deferred from subsequent donations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104954893\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis of post-transfusion purpura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PTP can present with severe thrombocytopenia (with platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;20,000/microL),</span> which is sufficient to cause purpura, petechiae, and clinically significant bleeding. For PTP caused by an alloantigen on the transfused platelets, the onset is approximately 5 to 10 days following transfusion, and the thrombocytopenia often lasts for days to weeks. For thrombocytopenia caused by passive transfer of an antiplatelet antibody, the onset is within hours, and recovery is within several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>If a patient with unexplained thrombocytopenia has received a transfusion in the previous one to two weeks, efforts should be made to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PTP. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating a circulating alloantibody to a common platelet antigen, most often <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1a/PlA1,</span> and lack of this antigen on the patient's own platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunologic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, specific tests to determine the platelet antigenic composition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of anti-platelet antibodies may not be readily available, and it may be necessary to contact a specialty laboratory such as the <a href=\"https://www.bcw.edu/bcw/Diagnostics/index.htm&amp;token=h7Ird6MEQJ0ciS3wlIS7447Jy16sh+ZIpMkwUg3Sq/NBgc9SQZ6YgXHnZgqgyv/JZsy3wTF4PYOJNMsZTxaG8g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7947\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Blood Center of Wisconsin</a> to obtain this testing. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of PTP includes other immunologically mediated forms of thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), acquired autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Like PTP, these conditions are associated with hallmarks of immune platelet destruction such as severe thrombocytopenia, occasional large platelets on the blood smear, and increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (if tested). Unlike PTP, these other thrombocytopenias rarely have a temporal relationship to a transfusion.

However, for patients who require a transfusion in the acute setting, avoidance of <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1a/PlA1-positive</span> components is prudent because it will limit the exposure to immunogenic antigens and may prevent additional allosensitization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10237461\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the acute immunologic transfusion reactions can present with fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory symptoms.

FNHTR typically presents with fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chills. The diagnosis is made clinically by excluding other causes of these symptoms, and management is supportive. Pre-storage leukoreduction reduces the risk of FNHTR. We do <strong>not</strong> use premedications as they are ineffective and may cause adverse events on their own.

They can be acute (AHTR; during or within 24 hours after transfusion) or delayed (DHTR; days to weeks after a transfusion). AHTRs are usually due to ABO incompatibility following a <span class=\"nowrap\">clerical/procedural</span> error and are associated with intravascular hemolysis, which can be life-threatening. DHTRs are usually due to an anamnestic response to a previously encountered RBC antigen (through prior transfusion or pregnancy) and are often mild or clinically silent. The implicated RBC antibody should be avoided in future transfusions. These reactions are discussed in much greater detail separately.

They often occur within minutes of transfusion and may present with wheezing, angioedema, and hypotension. These reactions are potentially life-threatening and must be treated with immediate stopping of the transfusion and administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, as well as hemodynamic and respiratory support, as described in the tables for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 3</a>) and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 4</a>).
