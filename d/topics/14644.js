In children, PH is most commonly associated with underlying cardiac or lung disease (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). PH may also be idiopathic or familial. Other causes of PH are rare in childhood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>). PH is associated with considerable risk of morbidity and mortality. Management of children with PH requires a multidisciplinary team with experience and expertise in this area.</p><p>The management and prognosis of PH in children are reviewed here.

However, if the PH is long standing and severe, closure of the defect may not be advised.

Careful attention to fluid balance is necessary when using diuretics in this patient population since some patients with RV hypertension may be preload-dependent and excessive intravascular volume removal may compromise cardiac output.

Warfarin is indicated in patients with PH secondary to thromboembolic disease; however, this is a rare cause of PH in children. The role of anticoagulation in other types of PH is less clear. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Aspirin</a> is sometimes used as an alternative, albeit with unclear benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Given the uncertain benefits, the use of anticoagulant therapy in children with PH must be weighed against the risks of bleeding (which are increased in young children given their greater predisposition to trauma) and the difficulty monitoring such therapy and maintaining therapeutic levels in young children. Certain diseases (eg, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) may preclude the use of anticoagulation.

Early observational studies in adult patients suggested a mortality benefit with anticoagulation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, in patients with severe and refractory symptomatic PH, these procedures may be considered.</p><p>Patients with severe PH face significant morbidity and mortality due to progressive right heart failure. Markedly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) leads to a reduction in left ventricular (LV) preload and consequently, systemic pressure, that can precipitate syncope and death. The purpose of right-to-left shunting is to avoid these undesirable outcomes by diverting blood flow to bypass the pulmonary vascular bed and enter the systemic circulation (ie, a &quot;pop-off&quot; communication), thereby providing adequate systemic blood flow and maintaining tissue perfusion, albeit with less oxygenated blood.</p><p>Procedures that have been used to generate right-to-left &quot;pop-off&quot; shunts in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) include balloon atrial septostomy and placement of a Potts shunt.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Balloon atrial septostomy</strong> &mdash; An atrial &quot;pop-off&quot; communication produced in the cardiac catheterization laboratory may reduce syncope and symptoms of right heart failure by providing a means for blood to bypass the lungs, fill the LV, and hence improve cardiac output. There are multiple reports of catheter-based atrial septostomy reducing syncope and improving functional class of patients with severe PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

A similar communication between the pulmonary artery (PA) and aorta can be effected by the use of a stent placed into a (small) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or a covered stent inserted between the aorta and left PA in the catheterization laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-65</a>]. A conduit connecting the PA with the descending aorta has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The use of this procedure in PH is based on the observation that patients who have PVR exceeding systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with a large ventricular septal defect or PDA tend to have better outcomes than those with similarly elevated PVR but no &quot;pop off&quot;. The aortic-to-PA communication reduces maximum right ventricular (RV) pressure, and increases systemic blood flow by virtue of the RV pumping some blood across the shunt to the systemic circulation. Available data are limited, but they suggest that this procedure often durably and considerably improves functional class in many patients with severe PH. This intervention is not standard practice and should be only performed in centers with considerable expertise in the required fields.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3263086084\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) can be used to resuscitate patients with PH suffering cardiac arrest, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> as support while awaiting lung transplantation. Pumpless paracorporeal lung assist devices (eg, Novalung or Quadrox oxygenator), have also been used as a bridge to lung transplant in patients with PH and severe RV failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. A cannula carries blood from the PA to the oxygenator, then back to the left atrium, so that a fraction of the RV output bypasses the high-resistance lungs. The utility of either form of mechanical support is constrained by the typically long delay between need for new lungs and their availability. In addition, mechanical support is often accompanied by complications within the first few days or weeks after its initiation. ECMO is most likely to be useful when used to support a patient with a reversible deterioration in condition rather than as a bridge to transplantation, but both ECMO and paracorporeal pumpless devices have been used to bridge patients to lung transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>].

Lung transplantation carries substantial risks and burdens, and may provide only relatively short-lived relief of symptoms, but waiting too long to list a patient can result in patient demise before donor lungs are available; timing of listing therefore requires considerable care. PH is the most frequent condition leading to lung transplantation in children ages one to five years and the second most frequent indication for lung transplant pediatric patients overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-management-and-prognosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].
