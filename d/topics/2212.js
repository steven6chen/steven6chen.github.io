The goals of BCT are to provide the survival equivalent of mastectomy, a cosmetically acceptable breast, and a low rate of recurrence in the treated breast.</p><p>While modern surgical techniques are less morbid than radical mastectomy, a mastectomy still requires the loss of the breast. For this reason, the question arose as to whether the breast could be preserved without compromising survival. Six modern, prospective, randomized clinical trials directly comparing BCT with mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>] and an overview of all completed trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] have shown equivalent survival between the two treatment approaches. The success of BCT is contingent upon moderate-dose RT in eliminating subclinical foci of disease in the ipsilateral breast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major issues related to breast conservation techniques for surgical treatment of breast cancer will be reviewed here.

Although BCT provides an acceptable alternative to mastectomy for the treatment of invasive breast cancer, it is not applicable to all patients. Mastectomy is mandatory for tumor control for some subgroups of patients with breast cancer, and it may provide more satisfactory outcomes in others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastectomy: Indications, types, and concurrent axillary lymph node management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The American College of Surgeons, the American College of Radiology, the College of American Pathologists, and the Society of Surgical Oncology have developed consensus standards of care for BCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Similar recommendations have been made by the Canadian Steering Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Care and Treatment of Breast Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The following issues are emphasized in the appropriate selection of patients for BCT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete history and physical examination prior to treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue biopsy with core needle sampling to provide conclusive proof of malignancy. Needle biopsy is preferred over surgical biopsy to reduce unnecessary surgery and avoid scars that may complicate the placement of the subsequent lumpectomy incision.

In some cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is warranted to decrease the tumor size and improve the success rate of breast conservation.

Imaging typically includes a combination of bilateral mammographic evaluation, with appropriate magnification views, and ultrasound, if appropriate. The tumor size should be included in the mammographic report, as well as documentation of associated microcalcifications, and the extent of the calcifications within and outside the mass.

The limits of the accuracy of MRI should be discussed with patients, so that they understand the need for biopsy of MRI detected lesions before definitive surgery. Breast MRI should be performed with a dedicated breast coil by expert breast imaging radiologists in institutions that have the capability to perform MRI guided needle biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wire localization of the findings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical decisions should <strong>not</strong> be based on MRI findings alone. MRI findings alone should not be used to change surgical planning and conversion from breast conservation to mastectomy. All suspicious findings on<strong> </strong>MRI require pathologic confirmation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection criteria for BCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The individual patient's needs and expectations should be accurately assessed. This requires that the patient and physician discuss the benefits and risks of mastectomy compared to breast conserving therapy (BCT) in regards to long-term survival, the possibility and consequence of local recurrence with either treatment, and the impact on cosmetic outcome and psychosocial adjustment. There are many issues to consider regarding this decision:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age is not a contraindication to BCT; physiologic age and the presence of comorbid conditions should be the primary determinants of local therapy in older women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retraction of the skin, nipple, or breast parenchyma is not necessarily a sign of locally advanced breast cancer and does not contraindicate BCT. However, if a portion of skin or the nipple areolar complex will need to be resected to achieve negative margins, the cosmetic implications of this should be factored into the decision to proceed with BCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic subtypes other than invasive ductal carcinoma (eg, invasive lobular cancer) are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]; these women are candidates for BCT if the tumor distribution is not diffuse and it can be excised with negative margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC) is an indicator that disease extent may be greater than clinically suspected but is not a contraindication to BCT by itself. Patients with negative margins are still acceptable candidates for BCT. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Extensive intraductal component (EIC)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node positivity is a marker of worse prognosis, but positive lymph nodes are not a contraindication for BCT, as BCT and mastectomy have equivalent outcomes independent of nodal metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer#H34414723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Patients treated with mastectomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor location should not influence the choice of treatment. Tumors in a superficial subareolar location may require resection of the nipple-areolar complex to achieve negative margins; oncologic outcomes will not be affected, but the cosmetic result may be. Although oncoplastic techniques improve cosmesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], the patient and her clinician need to assess whether such a resection is preferable to mastectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of breast cancer is not a contraindication to BCT (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Inherited susceptibility'</a> below); however, women with a strong family history suggestive of a genetic predisposition should be informed about their increased risk of a second primary cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high risk of systemic relapse is not a contraindication for BCT but instead indicates the need for adjuvant systemic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast conservation surgery (BCS) is not contraindicated for women with dense breast tissue. In a prospective study of 1052 patients undergoing attempted BCS, patients with dense breast tissue were significantly more likely to be treated with an initial mastectomy compared with women with less dense breast tissue (74 versus 52 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.44-2.62, p &lt;0.0001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This may reflect surgeon or patient bias rather than an inability to fulfill criteria for BCS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, MRI was performed more often in patients with dense breast tissue (65 versus 33 percent). However, breast density was not associated with positive margins for BCS or conversion to a mastectomy, and preoperative MRI did not decrease the risk of positive margins.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Connective tissue disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with a history of connective tissue disease tolerate irradiation poorly, and so the use of RT as a component of BCT must be weighed against the possible complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. However, despite numerous case reports describing radiation-induced toxicities, none of the three published retrospective matched-control studies have shown a statistically significant increase in acute toxicities in this patient population as a whole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/20,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,23</a>]. Only one was able to show a statistically significant increase in the risk of late complications in patients with connective tissue disease, and this effect disappeared in subset analysis by disease in all patients but those with scleroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, the largest of the three studies noted that patients with scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but <strong>not</strong> rheumatoid arthritis, were at a significantly increased risk of late toxicities. As a result, many radiation oncologists consider scleroderma and active SLE to be relative contraindications to BCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24</a>].

A large tumor in a small breast is a relative contraindication, since an adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration. However, tumor size in itself is not an absolute contraindication to BCT. Breast size is also not in itself a contraindication to BCT. Women with large or pendulous breasts can undergo breast irradiation successfully as long as reproducibility of patient setup can be ensured, and it is technically possible to obtain adequate dose homogeneity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of neoadjuvant treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy can reduce tumor size significantly and allow for breast conservation with acceptable rates of local recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62394 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Clip placement in the tumor bed under ultrasound guidance should be accomplished before or soon after neoadjuvant treatment begins if possible. The metallic clip ensures that the surgeon can accurately localize the tumor bed in case there is a complete response to chemotherapy.</p><p>The presence of multicentric disease, extensive micro-calcifications, extensive skin changes, a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer, and dermal lymphatic involvement are considered contraindications for this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few absolute contraindications to BCT.

It is imperative to remember that any patient who undergoes lumpectomy may ultimately require a mastectomy, and incisions should be planned with possible mastectomy incisions in mind. The incision should be placed close to the tumor to avoid extensive tunneling. In the upper part of the breast, incisions should be curvilinear or transverse and follow the natural skin creases (Langer's lines). In the lower part of the breast, the choice of a curvilinear or radial incision is dependent upon the contour of the breast, the distance from the skin to the tumor, and the amount of breast tissue to be resected. At the completion of the procedure, the incision should be closed with a subcuticular suture to avoid cross-hatching of the skin.</p><p>In deeper lesions, it is not necessary to remove skin, and preservation of the subcutaneous fat and avoidance of thin skin flaps are important in maintaining a normal post-treatment breast contour. If the tumor is superficial, it may be necessary to remove the overlying skin. Skin removal with a curvilinear incision in the inferior breast distorts the breast contour and should be avoided. It is also not necessary to remove needle tracks from core-needle biopsies or fine-needle aspirations.</p><p>Meticulous hemostasis is important, because a large hematoma distorts the appearance of the breast and makes re-excision and follow-up evaluation more difficult. The presence of a postbiopsy hematoma is not a contraindication to breast conserving therapy (BCT). Reapproximation of the breast tissue without tissue advancement is best avoided, since it can result in distortion of the breast contour, which may not be apparent with the patient supine on the operating table [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In addition, although the meta-analysis found an increased risk of IBTR following excision with close margins (as defined by each individual study), as opposed to negative margins (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.42-2.15), this risk was not emphasized in the guidelines due to the heterogenous definitions of a close margin between studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]</p><p/><p>Given these concerns and limitations, while routine re-excision is not necessary for a close margin (eg, &lt;1 mm), an individual patient's clinical and pathologic features should guide the decision to perform re-excision in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Factors to consider may include patient age, the size of the close margin (focal versus broad), discrepancies between radiographic and pathologic tumor sizes, and the morbidity involved with a re-excision lumpectomy. The decision whether or not to re-excise should be made in a multidisciplinary fashion, with input from the radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1023207626\"><span class=\"h3\">Margins for DCIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multidisciplinary panel convened by the Society of Surgical Oncology, American Society for Radiation Oncology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology recommended a 2-mm margin as the standard for patients with DCIS treated with breast conserving surgery followed by whole breast irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>The recommendation was based on a meta-analysis of 20 studies, including 7883 patients with DCIS and known margin status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. All patients underwent breast conserving surgery followed by whole breast irradiation; approximately 20 percent received endocrine therapy. After a median follow-up of 78.3 months, 865 patients developed recurrences; the median prevalence of IBTR was 8.3 percent (interquartile range 5 to 12 percent). Patients with positive margins defined as a margin &lt;2 mm had a twofold higher risk of developing IBTR compared with those with negative margins (24 versus 12 percent), and approximately one-half of the recurrences were invasive disease. The reduction in IBTR was similar in patients with a margin of 2 mm (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.85), 3 or 5 mm (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.97), and 10 mm (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.33-1.08). &#160;</p><p>The consensus panel advised clinical judgment when determining whether patients with smaller negative margin width (&gt;0 or 1 mm) require re-excision.

Patients who have DCIS with extension of cancer cells beyond the basement membrane but no focus more than 0.1 cm in the greatest dimension (ie, DCIS-M) should be treated the same way as DCIS patients when determining optimal margin width.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3842100625\"><span class=\"h3\">Techniques to achieve adequate margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate macroscopic margin of normal breast tissue to resect around the tumor for women undergoing BCT should be 0.5 to 1.0 cm of grossly normal breast tissue, which will usually result in histologically negative margins (ie, no tumor at ink) in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Larger resections may be necessary for invasive carcinomas with an extensive intraductal component (EIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>] or for infiltrating lobular carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/1,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,63-65</a>]. Preoperative wire localization, specimen orientation, specimen radiography, intraoperative margin assessment, and post-excision whole cavity shaving are all helpful for obtaining negative excision margins, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonpalpable lesion localization</strong> &#9472; For resection of nonpalpable lesions, preoperative wire localization by the radiologist permits accurate identification of the area requiring resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Multiple bracketing wires may be helpful for delineation of the boundaries of the resection but do not ensure clear histologic margins of resection. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The percentages of patients with positive margins after wire-guided BCS reported in the literature vary from 14 to 70 percent. In a Danish nationwide retrospective study of over 4000 women who underwent wire-guided BCS, 37 percent of patients with DCIS and 13 percent of patients with invasive breast cancer required reoperations for positive margins (defined as positive or &lt;2 mm). Among them, 23 percent of patients with DCIS and 12 percent of patients with invasive breast cancer required a second reoperation for persistently positive margins. Patients with lobular breast cancer had a higher reoperation rate than those with ductal breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternative techniques to wire localization, which are being increasingly used to guide resection of nonpalpable lesions, include radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL), radioactive iodine seed localization (RSL), and image guidance using implantable electromagnetic wave reflector (SAVI SCOUT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specimen orientation</strong> &#9472; The specimen can be removed as a single piece of tissue. Gross inspection of the specimen in the operating room, with or without frozen section analysis, permits identification of positive or close margins and immediate re-excision, if appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This will decrease the need to return to the operating room for re-excision. Sutures, clips, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multicolored inks are used to orient the specimen by the operating surgeon. Inking kits are available with six colors for labeling all of the surgical margins (superior, inferior, medial, lateral, superficial, and deep). Clear uniformity between surgeon and pathologist in terms of what suture or color corresponds to each margin is required. This facilitates reporting of the status of individual margins and if re-excision is required, the surgeon can limit the re-excision to the involved margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specimen radiography</strong> &#9472; Specimen radiography should be performed during the surgical procedure to confirm excision of the targeted lesion when the lesion was not palpable. Additional oriented margins can be resected prior to closure when the radiograph suggests inadequate resection, which may eliminate the need for a delayed re-excision. In a retrospective study of 123 patients undergoing BCS, specimen radiography identified 19 patients with a margin &le;2 mm who underwent additional intraoperative excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In 63 percent of cases <span class=\"nowrap\">(12/19)</span> histological assessment confirmed that the margins of the first surgical specimen were positive and intraoperative re-excision eliminated the need for a second operation. In another study of 264 patients undergoing BCS, specimen radiography identified 54 patients with close margins (6 with DCIS and 48 with invasive cancer), who underwent additional intraoperative excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Of these, 25 percent of patients with DCIS and 63 percent of patients with invasive cancer were rendered margin negative with intraoperative re-excision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraoperative margin assessment</strong> &#9472; Several approaches can be used for intraoperative margin assessment, including frozen section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/71,74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,74-78</a>], cytologic touch prep analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/79-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-84</a>], shaved margin analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], as well as intraoperative margin assessment devices such as MarginProbe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. There is no prevailing standard of care for intraoperative margin assessment and practices vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. The use of these techniques may assist in obtaining negative margins, but does not guarantee the absence of microscopic tumor on permanent sections. Patients should be advised that additional surgery to obtain clean margins may be necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Post-excision whole cavity shaving</strong> &#9472; An alternative approach is post-excision whole cavity shaving, where an additional margin of normal-appearing tissue is excised from each margin of the cavity (superior, inferior, lateral, medical, anterior, posterior) after lumpectomy has been completed. This technique has been shown to reduce re-excision rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/72,88-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,88-92</a>], including in a randomized trial where the rate of positive margins decreased from 34 to 19 percent, and the re-operation rate decreased from 21 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. However, whole cavity shaving increases the volume of resection; further studies are required to determine whether the benefit of this technique extends to lower recurrence rates or improved survival.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Cosmetic outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many surgical factors will play a role in the ultimate cosmetic appearance of the breast. These include the size and placement of the incision, management of the lumpectomy cavity, and the extent of axillary dissection if necessary. The surgeon has control over several of these issues, and careful attention to detail will improve the aesthetic results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].</p><p>In addition to local recurrence, a major goal of BCT is the preservation of a cosmetically acceptable breast. With modern treatment techniques, an acceptable cosmetic outcome can be achieved in almost all patients without compromise of local tumor control. In a series of women treated with a whole breast dose of 45 to 46 Gy (daily dose &le;2 Gy), a boost dose of 18 Gy, and precise field matching techniques, excellent or <span class=\"nowrap\">excellent/good</span> cosmetic results were noted at three years in 73 and 96 percent of women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Although treatment-related changes in the breast stabilize at approximately three years, other factors that affect the untreated breast, such as change in size because of weight gain or the normal ptosis seen with aging, continue to affect breast symmetry.</p><p>To help assess the cosmetic outcome after BCT, a scoring system to standardize the grading of cosmetic outcome has been recommended by a joint committee of the ACS, the ACR, the College of American Pathologists, and the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>], and used at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (JCRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

For women with &lt;35 cm<sup>3</sup> resected tissue, excellent and excellent or good scores were reported by 85 and 96 percent, respectively. In contrast, when the volume of resected tissue was &gt;85 cm<sup>3</sup>, excellent, and excellent or good scores were reported by 51 and 94 percent of women, respectively.

Seroma rates were significantly lower after breast conserving surgery than after mastectomy (6 versus 14 to 16 percent). The presence of a seroma significantly increased the risk of a concurrent or subsequent surgical site infection (8.5 versus 4 percent in the absence of a seroma).

In comparing the results of breast conserving therapy (BCT) with mastectomy and assessing the probability and impact of local recurrence, it is important to identify factors that may increase the risk of local recurrence. While not contraindications to BCT, these factors may influence the choice of treatment. </p><p>Mastectomy does not guarantee freedom from local recurrence. In randomized studies using variable surgical and RT techniques, long-term recurrence rates in the treated breast following BCT (with radiation) range from 5 to 22 percent, compared to 4 to 14 percent with mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/2-6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6,8,9</a>]. The time course of local recurrence differs with BCT versus mastectomy.

Compared with EIC-negative cancers, those with EIC and positive margins have a higher rate of true local recurrence, but not new ipsilateral primaries, contralateral breast tumors, or an increased likelihood of distant relapse.

In the larger of the two, 1274 women with stage I or II breast cancer undergoing BCT, the 10-year cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was significantly higher in women with associated LCIS (29 versus 6 percent, p = 0.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. A protective effect of systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy was suggested, since among women receiving adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, the local recurrence rates with and without LCIS were 8 and 6 percent, respectively.

Young women with a strong family history of either breast or ovarian cancer have a significant probability of and should be offered genetic counseling about these mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53270\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53270 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following treatment of a primary breast cancer, women with an inherited susceptibility for breast cancer are at increased risk (approximately five-fold) of developing a contralateral breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/137-142\" class=\"abstract_t\">137-142</a>]. Some, but not all, studies show that women with an inherited susceptibility for breast cancer treated with BCT are also at a significantly higher risk of local failure when compared to women with sporadic breast cancer treated with BCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/140-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-145</a>]. In addition, women with breast cancer and a <span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</span> mutation have a higher rate of local failure when treated with BCT as compared with mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. In a multi-institutional analysis of 655 women with <span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</span> mutations, local failure was more likely in those treated with BCT (302 women) compared to mastectomy (353 women); the cumulative estimated risks at 15 years were 23.5 and 5.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. Chemotherapy has a protective effect and reduced the risk of local failure at 15 years to 11 percent in the patients treated with BCT. There were no differences seen in regional or systemic recurrences between the BCT and mastectomy groups, and no difference in overall survival.</p><p>Prophylactic oophorectomy also has a protective effect in mutation carriers. This may reduce the risk of developing subsequent breast cancer in patients treated with breast conservation. A multi-institutional series compared the outcomes of 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</span> mutation carriers with stage I or II breast cancer treated with BCT with 445 control women with sporadic breast cancer undergoing BCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. At 15 years, there was no significant difference in the rate of in-breast tumor recurrence (24 versus 17 percent for controls, p = 0.19). However, <span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</span> mutation status was a significant risk factor for in-breast tumor recurrence in multivariate analysis when carriers who had undergone prophylactic oophorectomy were removed from the analysis (hazard ratio 2.0). These results indirectly suggest a protective effect of oophorectomy in carriers treated with breast conservation although more study is needed.

More than one-fourth of American women with stages I and II breast carcinoma are still undergoing mastectomy, with considerable geographic and age variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/65,95,146-154\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,95,146-154</a>].</p><p>Potential explanations for these observations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to BCT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of inappropriate selection criteria by clinicians</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing use of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient preference</p><p/><p>The first explanation, medical contraindications, is not a major cause of underuse of BCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/155-157\" class=\"abstract_t\">155-157</a>]. In one report that included 432 women with stage I or II invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who were prospectively evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, only 97 (22 percent) had contraindications to BCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. Contraindications to BCT can be readily identified with a careful history, physical examination and detailed mammography, including magnification views of the primary site. Using these parameters, in a series of 263 consecutive women, patients eligible for BCT could be selected with 97 percent accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p>The second explanation, clinician-related inappropriate medical and demographic selection factors, has been thought to be a major cause of high mastectomy rates in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/158,159\" class=\"abstract_t\">158,159</a>]. A joint study of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) evaluated factors predicting use of mastectomy as local therapy in 17,931 women with stage I or II breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. Women with larger tumor size, a clinically positive axilla, EIC in association with the invasive cancer, and higher histologic grade were more likely to undergo mastectomy than those with more favorable features. Other patient-related factors (eg, older age, insurance status, and geographic location) also predicted a higher mastectomy rate. Older women are more likely to have mastectomy recommended by their clinicians, and the majority undergo the procedure that is recommended by their clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging identifies additional ipsilateral disease in 16 percent of women with a new diagnosis of breast cancer and may influence surgical planning, leading to an increase in the mastectomy rate.

Successful BCT requires complete surgical removal of the tumor (with negative surgical margins) followed by moderate-dose RT to eradicate any residual disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to BCT include multicentric disease, diffuse malignant microcalcifications on mammography, prior radiation therapy to the affected breast, and persistently positive resection margins after multiple attempts at re-excision. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to the use of breast irradiation. It may be possible to perform breast-conserving surgery for pregnant women if surgery can be performed in the third trimester and breast irradiation is deferred until after delivery. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain connective tissue disorders are a relative contraindication to BCT as these disorders may lead to delayed toxicity from radiation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large tumor size has been considered a relative contraindication to BCT. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy can decrease tumor size significantly and allow BCT for large tumors with acceptable local recurrence rates. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stages I or II invasive breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery followed by whole breast irradiation, we recommend &quot;no ink on tumor&quot; as the standard margin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, we use an individualized approach to patients who have a close margin (eg, &lt;1 mm) with regard to re-excision. (See <a href=\"#H951131759\" class=\"local\">'Margins for invasive cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with breast conserving surgery followed by whole breast irradiation, we recommend negative margins (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Meta-analyses suggest that a 2-mm margin (compared with &lt;2 mm) may confer additional benefit for local recurrence. However, we use an individualized approach to patients who have a close margin (eg, &gt;0 or 1 mm) with regard to re-excision. (See <a href=\"#H1023207626\" class=\"local\">'Margins for DCIS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceptable cosmetic outcome can be achieved in almost all patients undergoing BCT without compromise of local tumor control.
