Under the action of plasminogen activators (t-PA and u-PA, described below), plasminogen is converted to plasmin, a serine protease that degrades fibrin and other proteins. The plasminogen molecule contains specific lysine binding sites, which mediate interaction with its target (fibrin) and major inhibitor (alpha-2-antiplasmin).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue-type plasminogen activator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is secreted by vascular endothelial cells and circulates in plasma in trace concentrations.

It is important not only in triggering fibrin degradation but also in activating plasminogen to plasmin on cell surfaces following binding to its receptor, u-PAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], where it can either degrade or activate a variety of proteins that play key roles in cell function and migration.</p><p>Plasmin activity is regulated not only by these two plasminogen activators but also by the following inhibitors of fibrinolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; also termed SERPINE1) is present in plasma in trace concentrations and is secreted by multiple cell types, including vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells. It is the primary inhibitor of both t-PA and u-PA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. By this action, PAI-1 suppresses plasmin formation and fibrinolysis.

Plasmin formed within the circulation is rapidly inactivated by alpha-2-antiplasmin. However, alpha-2-antiplasmin is present in lower concentrations in plasma than is plasminogen (2 microM). Therefore, intense plasminogen activation (eg, during administration of thrombolytic drugs such as streptokinase) can exhaust circulating alpha-2-antiplasmin, generate free plasmin, and produce a systemic fibrinolytic state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a procarboxypeptidase that circulates in plasma. It is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex and cleaves C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin fragments (to which plasminogen binds with high affinity), thereby disrupting recruitment of plasminogen to the partially digested fibrin clot, inhibiting fibrinolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical relevance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To restore vessel patency following hemostasis, the fibrin clot must be organized and removed by the proteolytic enzyme plasmin in conjunction with wound healing and tissue remodeling. Plasminogen, the precursor molecule to plasmin, binds fibrin and t-PA. This ternary complex leads to conversion of the proenzyme plasminogen to active, proteolytic plasmin.

Plasmin cleaves the polymerized fibrin strand at multiple sites and releases fibrin degradation products (FDPs).</p><p>One of the major FDPs is D-dimer, which consists of two D domains from adjacent fibrin monomers that have been crosslinked by activated factor XIII. Since D-dimer is generated from cross-linked fibrin, but not from fibrinogen, an elevated plasma concentration of D-dimer indicates recent or ongoing intravascular blood coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">plasminogen/plasminogen-activator</span> system is complex, paralleling the coagulation cascade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81428\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81428 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

One study involving more than 1000 patients with a personal or family history of thrombosis found an overall prevalence of plasminogen deficiency (ie, a plasma level &lt;70 percent of control, measured on at least two separate occasions) of 1.9 percent, with many of the affected individuals also exhibiting an additional thrombophilic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Heterozygous plasminogen deficiency produced no demonstrable phenotypic abnormality, whereas homozygous (ie, complete) plasminogen deficiency produced a marked delay in the clearance of intravascular thrombi, and triggered enhanced fibrin deposition in organs, such as the lungs and liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The severity of plasminogen deficiency can vary significantly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe isolated plasminogen deficiency, which can occur secondary to a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation at the plasminogen gene locus, has not been associated with thrombotic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

In addition, plasma levels of plasminogen activators may be affected by other factors, such as elevated levels of PAI-1. There have been sporadic reports of t-PA deficiency in patients with thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The assay also measures the time required for clot lysis to occur. Hence, it is a global assay of platelet function, the blood coagulation system, and the fibrinolytic system, rather than an isolated assay of the fibrinolytic system. Clot lysis time assessed by the GTT is shortened in patients with hyperfibrinolysis and prolonged in patients with impaired fibrinolytic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9534132\"><span class=\"h3\">Euglobulin lysis time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The euglobulin lysis time (ELT) is used to assess the global function of the plasma fibrinolytic system. Dilution of citrated plasma at low ionic strength and low pH precipitates the euglobulin fraction, a population of proteins that includes fibrinogen, plasminogen, and t-PA, but lacks fibrinolysis inhibitors. The proteins present in the euglobulin fraction are dissolved in buffer, clotted by addition of thrombin, and the time required for the clot to lyse is measured. A shortened ELT is characteristic of a hyperfibrinolytic state. The presence of a shortened ELT in the absence of thrombocytopenia and schistocytosis is characteristic of primary hyperfibrinolysis and can be used to help differentiate this disorder from DIC and TTP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78455 \">table 1</a>). The ELT was developed in the 1950s. While still used, it has tended to be replaced by more rapidly performed assays that assess the global function of the fibrinolytic system under more physiological conditions such as those mentioned above.
