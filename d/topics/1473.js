Atelectasis is also defined as collapse of alveolar spaces, generally of a magnitude severe enough to appear on a plain chest radiograph. Atelectasis is a common problem in pediatric patients. The three main types of atelectasis noted in children include obstructive atelectasis, resorptive atelectasis, and compressive atelectasis. In almost all cases, atelectasis is acquired and referred to as secondary; rarely, primary atelectasis caused by congenital abnormalities may be present from birth. An overview of atelectasis in children is presented here. The radiographic appearance of atelectasis and an overview of atelectasis in adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-patterns-of-lobar-atelectasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic patterns of lobar atelectasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atelectasis: Types and pathogenesis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to understand the pathophysiology of atelectasis, a review of the normal mechanisms that prevent lung collapse is required. Elastin fibers within alveolar walls result in a tendency for the alveoli to recoil inwards. This is balanced by the outward recoil of the chest wall and the interaction between the parietal and visceral pleura. In addition, the primary mechanism that keeps the lung from collapsing at low volumes is surfactant.</p><p>Surfactant is a complex phospholipid and protein mixture produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells. It functions to lower surface tension, which is defined by the law of Laplace:</p><p>Pressure = 2 x (surface tension) <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> radius</p><p>As alveolar volume decreases with expiration, surface tension increases to the degree that, without surfactant, the alveolus would collapse completely. This adhesive atelectasis becomes clinically relevant in diseases that result in absent or deficient surfactant production and homeostasis, including neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, congenital surfactant protein B deficiency, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neonatal respiratory distress: Disorders of transition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the normal lung, surfactant functions to keep alveoli open during expiration. Despite this, even a person with normal surfactant eventually will develop areas of micro-atelectasis that can progress to macro-atelectasis if coughing is prevented. In addition, it is suspected that we sigh in sleep to protect against the development of atelectasis. Yawning also may be a physiologic mechanism that prevents atelectasis.</p><p>Children are at increased risk for development of atelectasis because their lungs lack the collateral ventilation of adults. Specifically, the lungs of children do not have pores of Kohn and canals of Lambert, which allow collateral ventilation of obstructed alveoli. Thus, following airway obstruction, air in the alveolar space is reabsorbed, and collapse occurs more readily than in adult patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atelectasis: Types and pathogenesis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infants and young children are also prone to atelectasis as compared with adults, because their chest wall is compliant and, thus, provides less outward force to oppose the elastic recoil of the lung.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common type of atelectasis in children is obstructive atelectasis, due to complete or partial large airway obstruction. Obstructive atelectasis can be further classified on the basis of anatomy as intraluminal, intrinsic to the airway wall, or extramural. Examples of intraluminal causes of atelectasis include airway foreign body, blood clot, mucus plug, and tumor (eg, carcinoid).</p><p>Mucus plugging is the most common cause of atelectasis in the pediatric population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51657%7EPEDS%2F63366\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51657 graphicRef63366 \">image 1A-B</a>). &quot;Right middle lobe syndrome&quot; is seen in asthmatics who develop collapse of the right middle lobe (RML) in the midst of an exacerbation of asthma. It is theorized that a combination of mucus plugging, a small orifice and long segmental bronchus to this lobe, and compression from adjacent hyperinflated upper and lower lobes leads to this condition. Treatment of atelectasis in this setting is directed at controlling the underlying asthma. RML atelectasis also has been described in other diseases, primarily in the setting of mycobacterial infection; this usually is caused by extrinsic airway compression from enlarged hilar lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-negative patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Airway wall disorders that can cause atelectasis include bronchomalacia and bronchial stenosis. Primary bronchomalacia of a mainstem bronchus is caused by a lack of structural integrity within the airway wall and usually is <strong>not</strong> associated with atelectasis. In contrast, secondary bronchomalacia can be caused by vascular compression and frequently results in atelectasis. Segmental bronchomalacia can lead to increased risk for mucous plugging and can be associated with atelectasis. Bronchial stenosis can impair mucociliary clearance and predispose to atelectasis and postobstructive pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-intrathoracic-airways-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Extramural bronchial compression can lead to atelectasis, especially in combination with increased airway secretions. Vascular compression can be caused by dilated pulmonary arteries in children with pulmonic valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, or cardiomegaly. Atelectasis caused by cardiomegaly can be difficult to manage and may ultimately require a surgical approach. A three-dimensional printed bioabsorbable extra-mural stent has shown great promise for life-threatening tracheobronchomalacia and bronchomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical experience with these and other types of stents are discussed in a review article [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-intrathoracic-airways-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula&quot;, section on 'Tracheomalacia'</a>.)</p><p>Bronchogenic cysts or other space-occupying lesions (tumors) can also compress and obstruct bronchi and lead to obstructive atelectasis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful techniques to determine the cause of bronchial compression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-intrathoracic-airways-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula&quot;, section on 'Bronchogenic cyst'</a>.)</p><p>Infants and children with cystic fibrosis are especially prone to atelectasis. This is likely due to inspissated mucus within the airway leading to post obstructive atelectasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53555%7EPEDS%2F66266\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53555 graphicRef66266 \">image 2A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Resorptive atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resorptive atelectasis results from an alveolar space-filling lesion, typically pneumonia. It is especially common in patients with neuromuscular weakness who lack the ability to reinflate the collapsed area of lung. It differs from post-obstructive atelectasis in that the primary lesion is at the level of the alveolar space rather than the airway. Resorptive atelectasis can also occur in normal children. Resorptive atelectasis is especially common in patients with chest wall pain who limit their lung expansion and coughing; this is referred to as splinting. Splinting appears to be a risk factor for pneumonia, because patients avoid both deep breaths and forceful coughing. Prior to the development of antibiotics, pneumonia following rib fracture was a common cause of death. Impaired cough and splinting can also be problematic in patients with abdominal pain, particularly following laparotomy.</p><p>Patients with respiratory muscle weakness (eg, those with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, or spinal cord injury) are at increased risk for mucus plugging, atelectasis, and pneumonia. The atelectasis that develops in these patients is multifactorial, but the main problem is an inability to inhale deeply and reinflate areas of collapse. This is compounded by a weak cough that prevents the expulsion of mucus plugs. It is extremely common for children with respiratory muscle weakness to develop a prolonged period of atelectasis following pneumonia. This resorptive atelectasis is perpetuated by the individual's inability to fully reinflate the lobe or segment and to expel any mucus plugs. In the absence of aggressive airway clearance treatment (eg, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation), atelectasis may persist for years.</p><p>Postanesthetic atelectasis is a special form of resorptive atelectasis. Individuals undergoing general anesthesia are at particularly high risk for developing atelectasis for complex reasons, which include the characteristics of the anesthesia gases (use of 100 percent oxygen), the lack of sighing breaths, prolonged positioning, and reduction of end-expiratory lung volume (functional residual capacity) due to relaxation of thoracic musculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Relaxation atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relaxation or passive atelectasis develops when contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae is eliminated by a pleural effusion or pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In general, the uniform elasticity of normal lungs leads to preservation of shape even when volume is decreased, a quality called form elasticity. However, the different lobes will behave independently of each other on occasion. For example, the middle and lower lobes may shrink more than the upper lobe in the presence of a pleural effusion, while the upper lobe may be affected more by a pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Compressive atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final type of atelectasis seen in the pediatric population is caused by space-occupying masses within the chest. Examples include large cysts or overinflated lobes that can compress and collapse adjacent lung tissue. Cardiomegaly is another common cause of compressive atelectasis. It is common to see compressive atelectasis of adjacent lung tissue in children with congenital lobar emphysema and congenital pulmonary airway malformation. Compressive atelectasis is one of the indications for surgery in children with these conditions, and resolves completely after surgical correction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-lobar-emphysema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital lobar emphysema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital pulmonary airway (cystic adenomatoid) malformation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical findings of atelectasis in children tend to be minimal. In most cases, there are no changes in the physical exam. As an example, in the setting of asthma and compressive right middle lobe atelectasis, the upper and lower lobes will fill the space occupied by the collapsed lobe so that breath sounds can be normal in the right axilla. Crackles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheezes may be heard over areas of obstructive atelectasis if the airway obstruction is incomplete and allows some airflow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: Chest and abdomen&quot;, section on 'Lungs'</a>.)</p><p>When larger areas of the lung are atelectatic, there are generally physical findings. Atelectasis of a lower lobe may result in absent breath sounds. Compensatory hyperinflation of the remaining lobes might allow the perception of some breath sounds at the lung base, but when compared to the unaffected base, the amplitude will be decreased. As noted above, if atelectasis is caused by intrabronchial mucus plug or foreign body, crackles distal to the obstruction may be audible.</p><p>Dullness to percussion also may be noted in the setting of extensive collapse. Complete atelectasis of one lung is unusual in children but can cause tracheal deviation as well as greatly diminished or absent breath sounds in the affected hemithorax (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73236\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73236 \">image 3</a>). In long-standing atelectasis, particularly that associated with an airway foreign body, post-obstructive pneumonia and localized bronchiectasis may occur and result in inspiratory (and occasional expiratory) crackles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOLOGIC ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atelectasis is generally diagnosed on the basis of compatible radiographic findings. Pulmonary opacification, with or without associated adjacent compensatory signs, typically is evident. The atelectatic features are determined by the size of the area of volume loss and by the imaging modality utilized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-patterns-of-lobar-atelectasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic patterns of lobar atelectasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain films</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film findings include nonspecific small areas of opacity, subsegmental opacities with linear or angular margins, lobar opacities, or unilateral whole lung opacity with signs of compensatory hyperinflation, pulmonary fissural shift, mediastinal shift, or bilateral pulmonary opacification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80883%7EPEDS%2F59863\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80883 graphicRef59863 \">image 4A-B</a>). Etiologies may or may not be suggested based on the film findings. In a patient with an opacified hemithorax on chest film, it can be difficult to differentiate atelectasis from pneumonia, with or without pleural effusion. The simplest approach is to assess for mediastinal shift. Mediastinal shift towards the opacified lung suggests that the opacity is due to atelectasis. Looking for a &quot;bronchial cut-off&quot; sign may suggest a mucus plug or foreign body. Mediastinal shift away from the opacified lung suggests the possibility of pneumonia with pleural effusion or an intrathoracic mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363299388\"><span class=\"h2\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases in which there is no mediastinal shift, computerized tomography (CT) can help delineate pleural from parenchymal processes.&nbsp;Uncomplicated atelectasis, such as atelectasis that is associated with mucus plug or foreign body, generally does not involve the pleural space. The finding of pleural fluid in the setting of an opacified hemithorax suggests a diagnosis of pneumonia. Dependent atelectasis (atelectasis seen in posterior portions of the lungs in a supine patient) is a common finding in CT scans performed under anesthesia, and is often not clinically significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atelectasis can be diagnosed as an incidental finding on ultrasonography, such as basilar atelectasis noted on abdominal ultrasound. Normally aerated lung cannot be visualized because ultrasound waves do not penetrate gas. Atelectatic lung, however, appears as a solid, hyperechoic structure. The clinical role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of atelectasis is limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from the chest radiograph, there are few laboratory abnormalities associated with most cases of atelectasis. Indeed, one of the means of differentiating pneumonia from atelectasis is the absence of changes on complete blood count in the latter condition. Leukocytosis with a preponderance of immature forms is suggestive of pneumonia rather than atelectasis. Arterial blood gases and hemoglobin saturation usually are normal because of the protective mechanism of hypoxic vasoconstriction, which directs blood flow away from the unventilated lung to the areas of normal ventilation. However, sudden development of lobar atelectasis (such as in the post-operative patient) generally will result in some degree of hypoxemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of atelectasis should be directed at the underlying cause of collapse. A single approach to the radiographic finding of atelectasis cannot be applied given the spectrum of underlying causes. The literature on the treatment of atelectasis remains largely retrospective and anecdotal without many prospective, randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest physiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common treatment of atelectasis in the hospital setting is manual chest physiotherapy (percussion and drainage, deep insufflation, and saline lavage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are limited data supporting the efficacy of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. In patients with cystic fibrosis, short-term trials suggest some efficacy of airway clearance therapies, but long-term efficacy has not been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'Chest physiotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with neuromuscular weakness and atelectasis benefit from mechanical insufflation-exsufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mechanically assisted coughing greatly improves secretion clearance in the setting of respiratory infection in the patient with neuromuscular disease and should be first-line therapy for this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This modality is greatly aided by simultaneous manual augmentation of cough with either a thoracic squeeze or abdominal thrust during the expiratory phase. The use of this modality for Duchenne muscular dystrophy has gained widespread acceptance in the United States and internationally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. This therapy is helpful in any patient with inadequate or impaired cough clearance, such as those with cerebral palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) uses a device that mobilizes secretions by rapidly oscillating a column of air via mouthpiece. Aerosolized medications can be delivered simultaneously. The use of IPV for the treatment of atelectasis has been described in case series and prospective controlled trials, as illustrated below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one case series of four patients (three with neuromuscular disease) with atelectasis refractory to conventional therapy, three of four patients had clinical and radiographic improvement within 48 hours of initiation of IPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In a small randomized controlled trial of outpatients with neuromuscular weakness, IPV resulted in a decreased rate of hospitalization and need for antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPV has also been studied as a means to mobilize secretions in tracheotomized patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2756155027\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent positive pressure breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) has long been used in the intensive care setting in non-intubated patients.

The three main types of atelectasis seen in children are obstructive, resorptive, and compressive atelectasis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive atelectasis is the most common type of atelectasis in children, and is caused by complete or partial obstruction of large airways. This is typically caused by mucus plugging, particularly in children with asthma in whom it often involves the right middle lobe. Other causes of obstructive atelectasis include cystic fibrosis, bronchial stenosis, bronchogenic cyst, or compression of the airway from external structures such as vascular malformations or cardiac disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive atelectasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resorptive atelectasis results from an alveolar space-filling lesion such as pneumonia. It is especially common in patients with neuromuscular weakness who lack the ability to reinflate the collapsed area of lung or in patients with chest wall pain who limit their lung expansion and coughing. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Resorptive atelectasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation or passive atelectasis develops when contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae is eliminated by a pleural effusion or pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Relaxation atelectasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compressive atelectasis is caused by space-occupying masses within the chest, such as large cysts or cardiomegaly. The compression also may be caused by overinflated lobes, as in congenital lobar emphysema or cystic congenital adenomatoid malformation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Compressive atelectasis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atelectasis in children may be associated with few or no physical findings. Crackles or wheezes may be heard if the airway obstruction is incomplete. If larger areas of the lung are affected, breath sounds may be absent. Dullness to percussion may be noted in the setting of extensive collapse. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On plain chest radiographs, findings suggestive of atelectasis include nonspecific small areas of opacity, subsegmental opacities with linear or angular margins, lobar opacities, or unilateral whole lung opacity with signs of compensatory hyperinflation, pulmonary fissural shift, mediastinal shift, or bilateral pulmonary opacification. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Plain films'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of atelectasis should be directed at the underlying cause of collapse. In patients with asthma the most important treatment is to optimize asthma therapy. The most common treatment of atelectasis in the hospital setting is manual chest physiotherapy, but little clinical evidence supports the efficacy of this approach. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Chest physiotherapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cases of compressive atelectasis, surgical intervention is often necessary, unless the compression is due to lymphadenopathy, which is best treated by management of the underlying disease. Bronchoscopic examination is indicated if a foreign body is present or suspected, but otherwise is rarely used. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Invasive approaches'</a> above.) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Zopf DA, Hollister SJ, Nelson ME, et al.
