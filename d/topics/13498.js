The term &quot;PHACE(S)&quot; is sometimes used in the presence of ventral developmental defects, which include sternal cleft, supraumbilical raphe, or both. Since the original description in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], significant advances have been made in refining the diagnostic criteria, imaging guidelines, and knowledge of associated morbidities and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Previous terms for this condition have included Pascual-Castroviejo syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and sternal malformation-vascular dysplasia association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of PHACE syndrome. Infantile hemangiomas are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2421906127\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PHACE syndrome is an uncommon disorder. Its exact incidence and prevalence are unknown. There are over 300 individual case reports and case series published in the literature, and the PHACE Syndrome International Clinical Registry and Genetic Repository has over 200 individuals enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>PHACE syndrome has been reported in many ethnic groups, with a predilection for the female sex. In a series of 33 infants with PHACE, 74 percent were white, 14 percent Hispanic, 4 percent African-American, and 4 percent Asian, with a female to male ratio of 5.6:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] In an analysis of 150 PHACE patients from the PHACE Syndrome International Clinical Registry, the female to male ratio was 4.2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3330311801\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of PHACE syndrome is unknown. It is a sporadic condition, and there are no reports of familial occurrence. Some authors have suggested that the cause may be a somatic mosaic mutation in a cell of neural crest origin. The neural crest cells are important in cell migration during embryogenesis and midline structural development of the heart, trunk, and brain. The midline defects of the sternum and brain, as well as the cervical and cerebral arterial anomalies, suggest that pathogenic events or developmental field defects occur between 3 and 12 weeks of gestation, which is the period of early vasculogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. It is possible that PHACE has a complex pathogenetic mechanism involving gene-environment interactions or multifactorial causes.</p><p>The female predominance has led some authors to hypothesize that PHACE is an X-linked condition with possible male lethality. If this were the case, it would be expected that males have a more severe phenotype. However, in a study comparing 59 males with 213 females with PHACE, male patients did not have a more severe phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The only significant difference between males and females was a slightly higher rate of structural brain anomalies in males.</p><p>It has also been hypothesized that some cases of PHACE syndrome are due to X-linked inheritance, but favorable skewing of chromosome X inactivation in the mothers may prevent the development of a severe phenotype. However, the analysis of the X-inactivation patterns of 31 females with PHACE syndrome and their mothers did not reveal a significant pattern of skewed X-chromosome inactivation in the mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Likewise, a genome-wide copy number variation analysis in a cohort of 98 individuals with PHACE did not reveal a common deletion or duplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1632825594\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2320920907\"><span class=\"h2\">Infantile hemangiomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemangiomas in PHACE syndrome most commonly have a segmental distribution on the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70599 \">picture 1</a>). A mapping study of large facial hemangiomas identified four primary segments involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110878 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontotemporal, including the lateral forehead, anterior temporal and frontal scalp, and often the ipsilateral eyelid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maxillary, including the cheek and the ipsilateral upper lip but limited medially by the nasomedial sulcus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mandibular, including the preauricular region, mandible, chin, and lower lip</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontonasal, including medial frontal scalp and bridge, tip, ala, and philtrum of the nose &#160;</p><p/><p>The risk of PHACE syndrome is higher in infants with more than one facial segment involved. In addition, it is now recognized that large segmental hemangiomas on the scalp, trunk, or upper extremity can also be associated with PHACE-related congenital anomalies, even in the absence of a facial hemangioma. </p><p>There are reports of cases of PHACE syndrome associated with small facial or orbital hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These patients are classified as &quot;possible PHACE&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110054 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although the hemangiomas are frequently proliferative, a subset of patients will have abortive or nonproliferative, telangiectatic hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These hemangiomas should be distinguished from nascent hemangiomas observed in the first one to two weeks of life, which appear as a pink, flat patches and are often mistaken for a port wine stain before the proliferative phase begins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89391\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89391 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

These patients are at risk for airway obstruction, a potentially life-threatening complication. The presenting sign may be biphasic stridor or barking cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Mediastinal hemangiomas may also occur.</p><p>Hemangiomas in the auditory canal may cause obstruction and conductive hearing loss. Hemangiomas in the internal auditory canal are generally asymptomatic and often spontaneously involute; they can be detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. </p><p>Segmental hemangiomas of the small intestine in the region of the superior mesenteric artery may be complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding resulting in severe anemia requiring transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190704861\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior fossa anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study of 59 brain MRIs from individuals with PHACE, 24 (41 percent) revealed structural brain anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The most common structural brain anomaly is unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia, which is generally ipsilateral to the arterial anomalies and hemangioma. Cerebellar hypoplasia has been detected prenatally in some cases during routine fetal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Recognition of the association of cerebellar hypoplasia with PHACE can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Other cerebellar anomalies include Dandy-Walker variants and true Dandy-Walker malformation.

Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and septum pellucidum have also been reported. Pituitary abnormalities, such as empty sella turcica, partially empty sella, or ectopic pituitary, are important to note as they may indicate an increased risk for endocrine dysfunction such as growth hormone deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48035126\"><span class=\"h2\">Head and neck arterial anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital abnormalities of the medium-sized arteries of the head and neck are the most frequent extracutaneous anomaly in PHACE, occurring in approximately 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In a study of 70 patients with PHACE, the spectrum of arterial anomalies included dysplasia, narrowing, or aberrant course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Persistent fetal vessels may include the hypoglossal, otic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trigeminal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Rare cases of arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous malformation of the dura, requiring in some cases embolization, have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/10,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1428772846\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of acute ischemic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with PHACE syndrome are at risk for progressive narrowing of the cerebral arteries, which increases the risk for acute ischemic stroke. The most common presenting signs of stroke in these patients are seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemiparesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-and-young-adults-etiology-and-clinical-features#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Etiology and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>In a review of 22 children with PHACE syndrome and stroke, the risk was significantly higher in those with narrowing or nonvisualization of two or more major cerebral arteries, with an incomplete circle of Willis being an additional risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Other factors associated with stroke include concurrent infection or prior treatment with oral corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Patients with long segment, high-grade stenosis, especially if more than one artery is affected, are at higher risk for the development of pial and meningeal vascular collaterals in a moyamoya-like pattern. These patients are at high risk for stroke. Presenting symptoms include change in neurologic status, twitching, and seizures. Pial synangiosis has been successfully used as the treatment in several cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].

Nineteen percent had coarctation of the aorta, 21 percent an aberrant subclavian artery, 3 percent a vascular ring, and 13 percent a ventricular septal defect. Of note, 6 percent also had venous anomalies, and 6 percent had other structural heart defects. Tetralogy of Fallot and ectopia cordis have both been reported in association with PHACE syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31</a>]. </p><p>In contrast with the most common coarctation seen in the general population, which is juxtaductal, the characteristic coarctation in PHACE syndrome consists of a long-segment transverse arch narrowing, sometimes with adjacent aneurysmal dilation. Analysis of resected coarctation tissue demonstrates zones of scarring with significant loss of arterial smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers in the intima and media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Additional cardiac anomalies reported include right aortic arch, double aortic arch, and interrupted aortic arch. Aberrant subclavian arteries are frequent in PHACE syndrome. Therefore, caution must be taken when evaluating for coarctation because four-extremity blood pressure assessment for a gradient between the upper and lower extremities may not be accurate. In addition, patients may have a vascular ring that can cause swallowing difficulties and often requires surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1293946433\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventral midline anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventral midline fusion defects associated with PHACE syndrome may include suprasternal skin abnormalities (eg, pits, dimples, papules), sternal pits, sternal clefts, and supraumbilical raphe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In some patients, midline anomalies may present as thyroid aplasia, lingual thyroid, upper lip and nares clefting ipsilateral to the facial hemangioma, and cleft soft palate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097898471\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a prospective study of PHACE patients, 16 percent were found to have ocular anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Congenital anomalies of the eye can involve the posterior or anterior segment. Posterior segment anomalies are part of the major diagnostic criteria and include persistent fetal vasculature, &quot;morning-glory&quot; disc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55325\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55325 \">picture 3</a>), peripapillary staphyloma, and optic nerve hypoplasia.

Congenital third nerve palsy and Horner syndrome have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with hemangiomas in the frontotemporal and frontonasal segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110878 \">figure 1</a>) have the highest risk of ocular anomalies or complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2447490353\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurodevelopment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study of neurodevelopment outcomes in children with PHACE, 25 children underwent a neurodevelopmental evaluation using standardized neurocognitive tests assessing multiple domains and a parent-completed standardized questionnaire on emotional and behavioral function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Significant neurodevelopmental deficits were not identified in the group as a whole, but there was a subset of patients with delays in multiple areas. Patients with two or more domain scores at one standard deviation below the test norms had more severe phenotypes, but the highly variable clinical features among patients could not be correlated with developmental outcomes. In this study, one half of the patients were receiving speech therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3311040806\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech and language delay and dysphagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PHACE syndrome are at risk for speech and language delay, as well as dysphagia or swallowing difficulties. In a retrospective study of a cohort of PHACE syndrome patients, 17 of 34 patients had signs or symptoms of dysphagia or speech or language abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Speech and language abnormalities most commonly occurred in association with posterior fossa malformations (9 of 16) and with hemangiomas involving the lip or oropharynx (10 of 16). Swallowing difficulties occurred most commonly in patients with a history of cardiac surgery and hemangiomas of the lip or oropharynx. Posterior fossa abnormalities were present in four of nine patients with dysphagia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2887285569\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PHACE syndrome are at risk for congenital or acquired hypothyroidism. Congenital hypothyroidism, which is usually detected by screening tests at birth, may be due to an absent or poorly developed pituitary gland (central hypothyroidism), congenital absence of the thyroid gland, or lingual ectopic thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/1,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,38,39</a>]. Congenital absence of the thyroid gland may be detected with MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acquired hypothyroidism is generally related to the presence of large hepatic hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These tumors contain very high levels of type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase, which catalyzes deiodination of T4 to reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and triiodothyronine (T3) to diiodothyronine (T2), resulting in low serum T4 and T3 concentrations. Hypopituitarism and growth hormone deficiency is also a concern, especially in the setting of empty or partially empty sella. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;, section on 'Empty sella'</a>.)</p><p>Presenting signs are often poor height velocity and short stature in early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/22,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,42</a>]. Growth hormone replacement may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Hypopituitarism may present in adolescence with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and late-onset adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In one study, the average age of onset of the headaches was 49 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phace-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Migrainous features were frequent, including vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. &#160;</p><p>Any new or severe headache in a child with PHACE warrants a workup for the etiology, especially if it does not respond to analgesics or is associated with a functional disability.
