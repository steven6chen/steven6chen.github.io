When this happens, the electricity can damage tissues and organs. This damage can be mild or severe &ndash; and it can even cause death. Organs that are commonly damaged include the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart &ndash; People can get abnormal heart rhythms. Their heart can also suddenly stop beating, which is called &quot;cardiac arrest.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidneys &ndash; The kidneys can stop working normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bones and muscles &ndash; If the muscles are severely injured, substances from inside damaged muscle cells can leak into the blood. This is called &quot;rhabdomyolysis.&quot; In some cases it can cause injury to other organs. People can also get an abnormal build-up of pressure in a group of muscles, called &quot;acute compartment syndrome.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nervous system &ndash; People can pass out, have muscle weakness, or eye or ear damage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266961739\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an electrical burn?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on how much electricity came in contact with your body and how long the contact lasted.</p><p>Electricity can cause different types of skin burns, depending on which skin layers are affected. The terms doctors use to describe different types of burns are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial &ndash; A superficial burn affects only the top layer of the skin. The skin is red, dry, and painful. When you press on the burn, it turns white.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial-thickness &ndash; A partial-thickness burn affects the top 2 layers of the skin. The skin is red and can leak fluid or form blisters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full-thickness &ndash; A full-thickness burn affects all the layers of the skin. The burn doesn't usually hurt, because the burned skin can't feel anything. The skin can be white, gray, or black.</p><p/><p>Other symptoms depend on whether or not you have damage to your internal organs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266961754\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you get an electrical burn, see your doctor or nurse right away. That's because an electrical burn sometimes causes mild skin damage, but there can still be severe internal organ and tissue damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266961769\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your injury and do an exam. He or she might order tests to check for organ damage. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266961807\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an electrical burn treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of skin burn you have and how serious it is.</p><p>Treatments for a mild skin burn can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cooling the burn &ndash; You can put a cool cloth on your burn or soak it in cool water. Do <strong>not</strong> put ice on a burn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Covering the burn with a clean bandage &ndash; Your doctor might also recommend or prescribe a cream or ointment to soothe the skin or prevent an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treating the pain &ndash; To ease your pain, you can raise the burned part of your body above the level of your heart. For example, you can prop your foot or leg up on pillows. You can also take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a tetanus shot, if it has been too many years since your last one</p><p/><p>A severe skin burn is usually treated in the hospital. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong pain medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special bandages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic and other types of creams or ointments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to repair the burned area</p><p/><p>Your doctor will also treat any problems you have from damage to internal organs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266961822\"><span class=\"h1\">Can electrical burns be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help prevent you or a family member from getting an electrical burn, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put child safety covers on all electrical outlets.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep electrical cords out of the reach of children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow the directions when using electrical appliances.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using electrical appliances in the shower or bath.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turn off the circuit breaker when you are working with electricity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266961837\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-burns-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Skin burns (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sudden cardiac arrest (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpr-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: CPR for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpr-for-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: CPR for children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute kidney injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyolysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rhabdomyolysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute compartment syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-burns-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Skin burns (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
