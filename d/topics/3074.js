Less common causes are varicocele, spermatocele, localized edema from insect bites, nephrotic syndrome (swelling is usually bilateral), and rarely, testicular cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57879 \">table 1</a>). Scrotal swelling and testicular masses warrant prompt evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HYDROCELE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hydrocele is a collection of peritoneal fluid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis. Hydroceles may be communicating or noncommunicating.</p><p>Communicating hydroceles usually develop as a result of failure of the processus vaginalis to close during development; the fluid around the testis is peritoneal fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70784\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70784 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50831\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50831 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Noncommunicating hydroceles have no connection to the peritoneum; the fluid comes from the mesothelial lining of the tunica vaginalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58679 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Hydroceles are common in newborns (whether related to delayed closure of a patent processus vaginalis or fluid trapped at the time of testicular descent is not known) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of hydroceles in neonates resolve spontaneously, usually by the first birthday [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In older children and adolescents, noncommunicating hydroceles may be idiopathic or may occur secondary to epididymitis, orchitis, testicular torsion, torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis, trauma, or tumor (reactive hydroceles). These conditions must be excluded in children and adolescents with hydrocele. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of scrotal pain or swelling in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Testicular cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hydroceles present with a cystic scrotal mass. A hydrocele that communicates with the peritoneal cavity may increase in size during the day or with the Valsalva maneuver. In contrast, noncommunicating hydroceles are not reducible and do not change in size or shape with crying or straining.</p><p>In patients with testicular pain and scrotal swelling, the hydrocele may arise from epididymitis, orchitis, testicular torsion, torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis, testicular rupture, testicular hematoma, or tumor as the primary etiology (reactive hydroceles); Doppler ultrasonography is usually necessary to evaluate these patients further. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of scrotal pain or swelling in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Testicular cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of hydrocele can be made by physical examination and transillumination of the scrotum that demonstrates a cystic fluid collection. Communicating hydroceles are often reducible; noncommunicating hydroceles are not. Doppler ultrasonography may be necessary to evaluate the testicle and rule out a primary cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical repair is indicated for hydroceles in newborns that persist beyond one year of age, for communicating hydroceles, and for idiopathic hydroceles that are symptomatic or compromise the skin integrity.</p><p>The management of hydrocele in a neonate or child younger than one year of age usually is supportive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hydroceles that are present in newborns, whether communicating or noncommunicating, usually resolve spontaneously by the first birthday, unless they are accompanied by an inguinal hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Communicating hydroceles in older patients rarely resolve and pose a risk for development of incarcerated inguinal hernia. Surgical repair of communicating hydroceles is usually undertaken on an elective basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Idiopathic hydroceles are often asymptomatic. Surgical repair may be indicated for symptomatic complaints. Reactive hydroceles usually resolve with treatment of the underlying condition.

Its size increases with a Valsalva maneuver, and it does not transilluminate. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of inguinal hernia in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VARICOCELE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A varicocele is a collection of dilated and tortuous veins in the pampiniform plexus surrounding the spermatic cord in the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73206 \">figure 3</a>). The cause of primary or idiopathic varicoceles, that arise spontaneously and are not caused by obstruction of the inferior vena cava, is unknown. One etiologic theory is that primary varicoceles result from increased venous pressure and incompetent valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7</a>]. Varicoceles occur more commonly on the left side (85 to 95 percent) because the left spermatic vein enters the left renal vein at a 90 degree angle, whereas the right spermatic vein drains at a more obtuse angle directly into the inferior vena cava, facilitating more continuous flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Approximately 10 to 25 percent of all adolescent males and as many as one-third of all males examined at an infertility clinic have a varicocele. However, only 10 to 15 percent of males with varicoceles have fertility problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with varicoceles can be asymptomatic or present complaining of a dull ache in or fullness of the scrotum upon standing. The key task for the examiner is to differentiate primary varicocele from secondary varicocele caused by obstruction of the inferior vena cava. </p><p>The examination for varicocele initially should be performed with the patient standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The scrotum is inspected for any visible distention around the spermatic cord (indicative of a grade III varicocele). The scrotum, testes, and cord structures are then gently palpated; a palpable varicocele has the texture of a &quot;bag of worms&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73206 \">figure 3</a>). Grade II varicoceles are palpable, but nonvisible. The patient should then be asked to perform the Valsalva maneuver; if the varicocele is palpable only with the Valsalva maneuver, it is Grade I (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51251 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The patient also should be examined in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This maneuver will help to differentiate idiopathic or primary from secondary varicocele. Primary varicocele usually is more prominent in the upright position and disappears in supine, whereas secondary varicocele usually does not get much smaller with change in position from upright to supine.</p><p>If the varicocele persists in the supine position, has acute onset, or is right-sided (secondary varicocele), then processes that cause inferior vena caval (IVC) obstruction must be ruled out with Doppler ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Studies in adolescents correlating varicocele grade and testicular size in adolescents have had conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].

Most varicoceles in adolescents are managed conservatively with observation. When more aggressive treatment is necessary, varicoceles are repaired through surgical ligation or testicular vein embolization. These procedures should be considered under the following circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affected testicular volume is less than that of the unaffected testicle (a difference in size of &gt;10 to 15 percent or &gt;2 mL when assessed by ultrasonography); loss of testicular volume is associated with a decreased sperm count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; testicular growth arrest can be reversed with varicocele repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To alleviate symptoms: Pain, heaviness, swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral varicoceles.</p><p/><p>Although grade of varicocele should not be the sole indication for intervention, treatment may be warranted in adolescents with large varicoceles (grade III) and abnormal semen analysis because varicocele repair has been associated with improved semen analysis in adolescents and young men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>In one study, hormonal tests and orchidometry in 76 sexually mature (Tanner V) adolescents with varicocele were correlated with semen analysis. Twenty patients (26 percent) had abnormal semen. Unstimulated concentrations of LH and FSH were significantly greater in adolescents with abnormal than normal semen analysis (4.1 versus 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL</span> for LH, and 5.3 versus 3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL</span> for FSH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Neither mean testicular volume nor the ratio of testicular volume on the abnormal to the normal side differed significantly between groups. These data suggest that LH and FSH concentrations may be more helpful than testicular volume in identifying patients with testicular dysfunction in adolescents with varicocele.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SPERMATOCELE (EPIDIDYMAL CYST)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spermatocele (epididymal cyst) is a painless, fluid-filled cyst of the head (caput) of the epididymis that may contain nonviable sperm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67291 \">figure 4</a>). A spermatocele can be palpated as distinct from the testis and typically transilluminates as a cystic mass. In contrast, testicular tumors are palpated within the testis and do not transilluminate. Ultrasonography may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of spermatocele. Spermatoceles do not affect fertility. Treatment (eg, surgical excision) is indicated to relieve discomfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTICULAR CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular cancer accounts for 20 percent of cancer diagnosed in males 15 to 35 years old, rendering it the most common solid tumor in males within this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The epidemiology and risk factors for testicular cancer, which include cryptorchidism, family history of testicular cancer, cancer of the other testicle, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS, formerly called intratubular germ cell neoplasia of the unclassified type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]), and race, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular cancer usually presents as a painless mass discovered by the patient or clinician on physical examination, although rapidly growing germ cell tumors may cause acute scrotal pain secondary to hemorrhage and infarction. Other common signs are testicular enlargement or swelling. Many patients also report an aching feeling in the lower abdomen or scrotum.</p><p>On examination, intrascrotal malignancies usually are firm, nontender masses that do not transilluminate unless accompanied by a reactive hydrocele. Some patients may have gynecomastia. The clinical presentation of testicular cancer and advanced or metastatic testicular cancer are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scrotal ultrasound is the initial diagnostic test of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. Although pathology is the definitive diagnostic test, scrotal ultrasound may help to distinguish intrinsic from extrinsic testicular lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several conditions may mimic neoplasia on ultrasound, including inflammation, hematoma, infarct, fibrosis, and tubular ectasia of the rete testis. In cases in which the ultrasound is inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help differentiate benign from malignant lesions. This was illustrated in a study of 622 patients who underwent ultrasound examination to evaluate a variety of scrotal diseases, of whom 17 had a lesion suspicious for cancer but an inconclusive ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. No lesion defined as benign by MRI proved to be malignant (negative predictive value 100 percent), although two benign inflammatory lesions were mistakenly thought to be malignant (positive predictive value 71 percent). These findings suggest ultrasound is sufficient in the vast majority of patients with suspected malignancy on examination, but MRI is a useful adjunct when the ultrasound result is equivocal.</p><p>Boys with lesions that are consistent with cancer should be referred to a urologist for diagnostic evaluation, which may include blood tests for various tumor markers, and radical inguinal orchiectomy.

Inferior vena caval obstruction must be excluded in patients with varicocele if the varicocele persists in the supine position, has acute onset, or is only right-sided. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Varicocele'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A spermatocele (epididymal cyst) is a painless, fluid-filled cyst of the head (caput) of the epididymis that may contain nonviable sperm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67291 \">figure 4</a>). Spermatoceles do not affect fertility and rarely require excision. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Spermatocele (epididymal cyst)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular cancer usually presents as a painless mass in the testicle that is firm and nontender; it may be accompanied by a reactive hydrocele. Such masses must be evaluated promptly. Scrotal ultrasonography is the initial diagnostic test of choice; boys with lesions that are consistent with cancer should be referred to an urologist for additional evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Testicular cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boys with a history of cryptorchidism, previous testicular cancer, HIV infection, intratubular germ cell neoplasia of the unclassified type (also called carcinoma in situ or testicular intraepithelial neoplasia), or family history of testicular cancer are at risk of developing testicular cancer. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Testicular cancer'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Baskin LS, Kogan AB.
