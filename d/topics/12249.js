An extremely high morbidity, relatively low quality of life (due in part to a high level of dependence and unemployment), and high cost have also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The Hemodialysis (HEMO) and Adequacy of Peritoneal Dialysis in Mexico (ADEMEX) trials found that increasing the dialysis dose within the general restrictions of a thrice-weekly regimen or of peritoneal dialysis, respectively, failed to decrease patient mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>). The institution of more intensive dialysis regimens provided evidence of improvement in morbidity and possible mortality in this patient population. Compared with conventional three times per week regimens, for example, dialysis associated with longer duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> higher frequency correlated with enhanced outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>Given these findings, nocturnal hemodialysis (eg, long, nightly home hemodialysis) was introduced as a (possibly) more desirable alternative to conventional dialysis since it provides superior dialysis based upon dose, duration, and frequency. This can be accomplished because it is performed during nightly sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Although Sheldon is credited for overnight dialysis at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], Uldall established the first quotidian (daily) nocturnal hemodialysis program in 1994 at the Wellesley Hospital in Toronto [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>].

These include improved solute clearance, possibly improved quality of life, better blood pressure control, and reduced medication requirements. Some of the benefits with the technique have been clearly shown, such as markedly increased clearances of urea and phosphate and blood pressure control, while others, such as enhanced survival, have not been confirmed. Some of the benefits demonstrated by the observational studies may have been influenced by patient selection biases, with younger and healthier patients choosing home modalities.</p><p>Multiple observational studies and two randomized trials have shown that more frequent dialysis improves selected outcomes. A benefit on survival has not been convincingly shown. These data are discussed elsewhere.

Higher dialysate flows in combination with large surface area dialyzers provide an <span class=\"nowrap\">spKt/V</span> of 1.7 to 2 and weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of approximately 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. This compares favorably with the target weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of only 3.6 that is recommended for patients undergoing conventional hemodialysis by the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiation working group for hemodialysis adequacy. The weekly standard <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> which has been proposed as a measure of dialysis dose across dissimilar regimens and residual renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], is approximately 5, thereby making this technique particularly suitable for large patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>].

At 12 months of follow-up, compared with those receiving conventional hemodialysis, patients receiving frequent nocturnal hemodialysis had a lower serum phosphorus (5.91 versus 4.72 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> respectively), and many more patients did not require phosphate binders (73 percent versus 8 percent in the conventional hemodialysis group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a crossover study, the serum phosphorous levels of eight chronic dialysis patients were measured during five months of conventional hemodialysis and then after the switch to five months of therapy with nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Serum phosphate levels were significantly lower with nocturnal hemodialysis (4.0 versus 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.3 versus 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> than those with conventional hemodialysis. In addition, patients undergoing nightly dialysis increased their dietary phosphorous intake by 50 percent and did not require phosphate binders after the fourth month. Furthermore, to maintain normal serum phosphate concentrations, more than 50 percent of all patients required the addition of phosphate to the dialysate.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta2-microglobulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since large molecule removal by hemodialysis is time dependent, the removal of beta2-microglobulin is markedly higher with nocturnal hemodialysis than with conventional hemodialysis. In one study, nocturnal hemodialysis was associated with a four times higher solute removal of beta2-microglobulin (585 versus 127 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> and a greater reduction in plasma beta2-microglobulin concentrations (39 versus 21 percent) compared with conventional hemodialysis (performed for four hours, three times per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

As an example, in the FHN Nocturnal trial cited above, systolic blood pressure was lower at 12 months among patients who received frequent nocturnal dialysis compared with patients who received conventional three times weekly hemodialysis (137 versus 151 mmHg, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/30,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,40</a>]. To achieve normotension without medications, the target weight is progressively decreased until all antihypertensive agents are discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/20,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Left ventricular hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some, but not all, studies suggest that nocturnal hemodialysis is associated with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/20,26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26,30</a>]. As an example, in a study of 44 patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis who were randomly assigned to nocturnal hemodialysis (six <span class=\"nowrap\">times/week)</span> or continued conventional hemodialysis (three <span class=\"nowrap\">times/week)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], at six months, left ventricular mass had significantly decreased with nocturnal hemodialysis (177 to 164 g) compared with no change in the conventional hemodialysis group (182 to 183 g). The effect was related, in part, to a decrease in blood pressure; however, the effect of improved volume control was unclear since volume status was not assessed.</p><p>However, in the FHN Nocturnal trial, despite a positive trend, there was no difference at 12 months in one of the primary composite endpoints, which included death or change in left ventricular mass, among 87 patients who were randomly assigned to either three times weekly conventional hemodialysis or six times weekly nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited evidence suggests that the switch to nocturnal hemodialysis may improve myocardial function as assessed by ejection fraction. In one small study, for example, cardiac function improved upon conversion to nocturnal hemodialysis in a group of six patients with end-stage renal disease and diminished left ventricular ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Ejection fraction increased from 28 to 41 percent. In another study, intradialytic left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities (myocardial stunning) decreased with increasing dialysis intensity, favoring daily and nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Myocardial stunning is associated with high ultrafiltration requirements, intradialytic hypotension, long-term loss of systolic function, increased likelihood of cardiovascular events, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are improvements in vascular responsiveness with nocturnal hemodialysis. In a prospective cohort study of 18 end-stage renal disease patients before and after conversion to nocturnal hemodialysis, an improvement in blood pressure control was associated with significant decreases in the total peripheral resistance (TPR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This suggests that the hypotensive effect of nocturnal hemodialysis is mediated through a reduction in an elevated TPR rather than exclusively by a fall in the intravascular volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Other studies have shown increased vascular compliance, improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, increased number and function of endothelial progenitor cells, improved angiogenesis, and restoration of perfusion associated with nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart rate variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conversion from conventional to quotidian nocturnal hemodialysis is associated with increased heart rate variability during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The FHN trial also detected beneficial effects of daily hemodialysis in the form of increased vagal modulation and increased beat-to-beat variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis#H9482545\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) daily trial'</a>). A decrease in heart rate variability, a characteristic common in patients with end-stage renal disease, correlates with increased cardiovascular mortality in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. How this affects clinical outcomes needs to be determined. Nocturnal hemodialysis has also been associated with improved baroreflex sensitivity and the baroreflex effectiveness index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of coronary calcification and factors underlying progression were evaluated in an observational cohort study of 38 patients who converted to nocturnal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. At follow-up at a mean period of 16 months, there was no change in coronary calcification (as assessed by multislice computed tomography [CT]) in 24 patients with minimal coronary calcification (initial score of 0.7 to follow-up score of 6.0), while there was a nonsignificant increase in the remaining individuals with higher initial calcification (1874 to 2038). The calcium-phosphate product and use of oral calcium-based phosphate binders also significantly decreased after conversion.</p><p>This rate of coronary calcification progression is significantly lower than that observed in studies of patients undergoing conventional hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Although further study with a randomized, controlled trial is required, these findings suggest that conversion to nocturnal hemodialysis may lower rates of progression of coronary calcification, perhaps due in part to favorable effects upon <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/phosphate</span> metabolism.

Inadequate dialysate calcium can lead to negative calcium balance associated with increased PTH and alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Conversely, an overzealous increase in dialysate calcium can lead to low bone turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Bone density studies performed yearly and occasionally more often are very useful in adjusting dialysate calcium concentrations and ensuring that negative calcium balance is avoided. The role of vitamin D analogs is unknown. In one patient, extensive pre-existing extraosseous tumoral calcifications dissolved upon conversion to nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>There is also an increase in both 25-hydroxy and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D levels, which directly correlates with the enhanced dialysis dose in nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

When pregnancy does occur, intrauterine growth retardation and miscarriage occur unless dialysis frequency is increased to five to six times per week. A paucity of data exists concerning the effect of nocturnal hemodialysis on fertility and pregnancy. In a small cohort study, five women undergoing nocturnal hemodialysis had seven pregnancies, resulting in six live infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Although less common or severe than historic controls, complications included intrauterine growth restriction or small for gestational age (two infants), delivery before 32 weeks (one), and shortened cervix threatening labor (one). Thus, nocturnal hemodialysis may be associated with improved fertility. However, given its small size and observational design, this study is limited. Whether it is the increased frequency, greater dose, or better timed average concentration of urea that produces a greater success rate requires further prospective studies. A study compared the pregnancy outcomes from 22 pregnancies in the Toronto Pregnancy and Kidney Disease Clinic and Registry (2000 to 2013), including mostly women on intensive hemodialysis, with outcomes from 70 pregnancies in the American Registry for Pregnancy in Dialysis Patients (1990 to 2011). The live birth rate in the Toronto cohort was significantly higher than the rate in the American cohort (86.4 versus 61.4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. A dose response between dialysis intensity and pregnancy outcomes was shown, with live birth rates of 48 percent in women dialyzed &le;20 hours per week and 85 percent in women dialyzed &gt;36 hours per week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on patient survival on nocturnal hemodialysis have been published, with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 746 patients initiated for the first time on in-center, three times weekly nocturnal hemodialysis performed at 77 outpatient centers in the United States, the two-year adjusted mortality risk was lower compared with 2062 matched control patients on conventional hemodialysis (19 versus 27 percent, respectively, hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The mortality of the matched cohort was lower than the reported mortality rate for hemodialysis patients in the United States, however, suggesting that patients selected for in-center nocturnal hemodialysis may be healthier than the average hemodialysis patient in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective study, 338 patients who were receiving intensive home hemodialysis (either day or overnight with a mean of 4.8 sessions per week and a mean treatment time of 7.4 hours per session) were compared with 1338 propensity-matched patients on conventional hemodialysis (mean of three sessions per week with a mean treatment time of 7.4 hours per session) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

In a similar study, but including a Canadian rather than an American patient transplantation cohort, the nocturnal hemodialysis patient survival rate was inferior to the diseased-donor cohort. This reflected the difference in mortality between the two transplant cohorts rather than the nocturnal hemodialysis groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p>However, in the FHN Nocturnal trial cited above, there was no difference at 12 months in the two primary composite endpoints, which included death or change in left ventricular mass and death or change in quality of life as assessed by the RAND-36 survey, among 87 patients who were randomly assigned to either three times weekly conventional hemodialysis or six times weekly nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A follow-up study of the patients after the completion of the FHN trial showed a higher mortality rate in the nocturnal hemodialysis group compared with controls dialyzed mainly on conventional home hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The deaths took place mainly during the year after the completion of the trial. The results were unexpected and contradict the data from the observational studies.

Some of the benefits with the technique have been clearly shown, while others require further analysis. Some of the benefits demonstrated by the observational studies may have been influenced by patient selection biases, with younger and healthier patients choosing home modalities. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance of urea, phosphate, and beta2-microglobulin are markedly enhanced with nocturnal hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that quality of life also may be improved, although not confirmed by randomized, controlled studies. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clearances'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Quality of life'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excellent blood pressure control is achieved by nocturnal hemodialysis, with almost all patients no longer requiring antihypertensive medications. Increasing evidence also suggests that nocturnal hemodialysis is associated with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbance is minimal during nocturnal hemodialysis, and sleep architecture appears to improve. Nocturnal hemodialysis also significantly liberates dietary intake of dialysis patients. Patients are kept on a free diet including the unrestricted intake of salt, water, potassium, phosphate, and protein. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Sleep'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant conclusions can be drawn concerning the effect of nocturnal hemodialysis on survival. Despite evidence of improved survival in observational studies, higher mortality rates have been reported during the year after the completion of the Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) trial in the nocturnal group. In addition, depending upon the <span class=\"nowrap\">consumable/personnel</span> cost ratio in different countries, nocturnal hemodialysis can be less or more expensive than in-center conventional hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Survival'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Cost'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possible negative effects of frequent nocturnal hemodialysis include increased vascular complications, accelerated decline in residual renal function, and increased caregiver burden. (See <a href=\"#H2139213930\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1818145712\" class=\"local\">'Residual renal function'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3195490501\" class=\"local\">'Caregiver burden'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In view of the clinical results, acceptance by patients, and favorable financial profile in some jurisdictions, nocturnal hemodialysis should be considered as an attractive option for patients who are willing and capable of performing home hemodialysis. Obstacles to adoption of nocturnal hemodialysis are unfamiliarity with home hemodialysis and the financial impact of the high frequency of dialysis.
