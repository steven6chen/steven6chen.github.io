First, many different types of lesions occur in this location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56637\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56637 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53534\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53534 \">figure 2</a>). Second, biopsies often consist of small, crushed specimens. Third, few pathologists have significant experience with mediastinal pathology because specimens from this location are relatively uncommon.</p><p>Since many tumors that occur in the mediastinum are undifferentiated and have overlapping histologic features, one must consider a broad differential diagnosis and perform a thorough evaluation of each biopsy specimen. This is particularly important since appropriate therapy for various mediastinal tumors differs considerably and may significantly impact survival. Additionally, it may not be apparent whether the tumor actually arises in the mediastinum or from adjacent lung.</p><p>The pathology of mediastinal tumors is reviewed here. The clinical evaluation of mediastinal masses is discussed elsewhere, and clinical and management issues of the specific tumor types are reviewed in the relevant topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most difficult problems in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumors can be obtaining an adequate biopsy specimen. As some mediastinal tumors are not treated surgically (eg, lymphoma), diagnosis is often attempted with needle core or minimally invasive surgical biopsies. Biopsies may be non-diagnostic because the lesion is not sampled adequately or because crush artifact or extensive necrosis, fibrosis, or cystic change obscures the diagnostic lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraoperative frozen sections are often used in the setting of surgical procedures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To determine if diagnostic tissue has been obtained</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To establish the diagnosis so that optimal surgical treatment can be rendered</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To assess resection margins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the stage of the tumor</p><p/><p>While some tumors can readily be diagnosed by frozen section, there are many &quot;mimickers&quot; in mediastinal pathology that can cause diagnostic difficulties. This is illustrated by one study in which only 37 percent of malignant mediastinal tumors were diagnosed correctly on frozen section, while the diagnosis was deferred in 35 percent and incorrect in 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Frozen section processing introduces artifacts, and additional tissue should also be obtained for processing that is not submitted for frozen sectioning. If the tumor is extensively fibrotic or necrotic, generous sampling may avoid the need for additional biopsy procedures. It can be useful to set aside a piece of tumor to be snap frozen for special immunohistochemical or molecular analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THYMOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymoma is defined as a low-grade epithelial neoplasm arising in the thymus; these tumors are commonly located in the anterosuperior mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, thymomas can also be found in other regions of the mediastinum, the neck, pulmonary hilum, thyroid gland, lung, or pleura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of thymoma, including thymic carcinoma, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and management of thymoma and thymic carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grossly, most thymomas are encapsulated, circumscribed, tan, firm masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59567\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59567 \">picture 1</a>). They may range from microscopic lesions to tumors over 30 centimeters in diameter. The cut surface is often lobulated, with bands of fibrous stroma. Cystic changes may be extensive, and in such cases, the cyst wall should be sampled carefully to search for tumor foci.</p><p>Invasive thymomas may be minimally invasive microscopically, or macroscopically, encasing mediastinal structures, spreading to the pleura, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invading the lung. Good communication is necessary between surgeon and pathologist so that margins can be appropriately evaluated and any anatomic structure removed in addition to the thymus (eg, pericardium) can be adequately identified. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of thymomas are surrounded by a fibrous capsule, which may be calcified. Thick collagen bands connected to the capsule divide the tumor into multiple lobules of varying size, giving thymoma a typical low power morphology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70463 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>Thymomas are composed of a mixture of neoplastic epithelial cells and non-neoplastic T lymphocytes, admixed in varying proportions. The epithelial component may have a variety of morphologies, but the two most common are, the polygonal, round, or oval cell type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55619\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55619 \">picture 3</a>), and the spindle cell type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50356\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50356 \">picture 4</a>). &#160;</p><p>Thymomas may have a storiform pattern resembling a fibrous histiocytoma, staghorn-shaped vessels resembling those seen in solitary fibrous tumors, rosettes similar to neuroendocrine tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63167\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63167 \">picture 5</a>), gland-like structures, or a papillary growth pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prominent plasma cell infiltrates, microcystic patterns, and prominent myoid cells (rhabdomyomatous thymoma) may be encountered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Prominent, dilated perivascular spaces, which are seen in approximately 70 percent of thymomas, are a characteristic histologic feature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55619\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55619 \">picture 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The spaces are filled by plasma fluid and may contain a few lymphocytes, plasma cells, or foamy macrophages. Small vessels with hyalinized walls are often present in the center of these spaces. Neoplastic cells surrounding these spaces may show a palisading arrangement. Other histologic features seen in thymomas include Hassall's corpuscles (14 percent), cystic change (19 percent), a &quot;starry-sky&quot; pattern, and squamous differentiation (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Predominantly lymphocytic and epithelial thymomas consist of greater than two-thirds lymphocytes or epithelial cells, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. In predominantly lymphocytic thymomas, the thymic epithelial cells are inconspicuous and may be difficult to recognize (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82468\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82468 \">picture 6</a>). Such cases can be mistaken for small lymphocytic lymphomas. Recognition of the presence of epithelial cells can be facilitated by the use of keratin stains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52137\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52137 \">picture 7</a>). Mixed lymphocytic and epithelial thymomas show approximately equal numbers of lymphocytes and thymic epithelial cells. Predominantly epithelial thymomas may be confused with thymic carcinomas or squamous carcinoma metastatic from other sites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification of thymomas was originally based upon the presence of lymphocytic, epithelial cells, or a mixed tumor cell population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73323\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73323 \">table 1</a>). Subsequently, Marino and Muller-Hermelink (MM-H) proposed a classification system related to the cortical or medullary differentiation of the tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>These earlier systems were consolidated into the World Health Organization (WHO) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53024 \">table 2</a>) classification scheme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A thymoma, corresponding to the medullary thymoma of MM-H, is composed of bland spindle cells and few lymphocytes. These tumors have an excellent prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type AB thymoma, corresponding somewhat to the mixed thymoma of MM-H, is composed of two components, one resembling the type A thymoma and one with plump cells and predominant lymphocytic infiltrate. Their prognosis is very good, with 66 percent being non-invasive and 34 percent minimally invasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B1 thymoma, corresponding to predominantly cortical thymoma of MM-H, is composed of epithelial cells with vesicular nuclei and small nucleoli and an abundant lymphocytic population. Invasion of adjacent organs is reported in 12 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B2 thymoma, corresponding to the cortical thymoma of MM-H classification, is a predominantly lymphocytic thymoma in which scattered plump cells with vesicular nuclei are observed. In the study from the M&uuml;ller-Hermelink group, most cortical thymomas invaded the adjacent structures, and 9 percent had pleural, pericardial, or distant metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B3, corresponding to the well-differentiated carcinoma of MM-H classification, is predominantly composed of polygonal or round epithelial cells with mild atypia. This category also includes the so-called &quot;atypical&quot; thymoma that shows variable degree of cytologic atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Invasion of adjacent structures is present in 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Histologic heterogeneity is common, with more than one histologic subtype frequently present in a given tumor, making histologic subclassification difficult. The size of the biopsy or the extent of histologic sampling may affect the ability to classify the histologic type or degree of invasion. It may be impossible to determine whether a thymoma is invasive, particularly on a mediastinoscopic biopsy.</p><p>The clinical relevance of the WHO classification system has been validated by many studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the prognostic significance may not apply to all subtypes, as some studies have shown a similar clinical outcome for type A and B thymomas, while type B3 thymoma typically have a more adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymic epithelial cells stain for epithelial markers such as keratin and epithelial membrane antigen, as well as Leu-7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thymic lymphocytes stain for LCA, CD3, CD1, and CD99 (MIC2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. According to the MM-H system, the medullary thymomas tend to have fewer immature (CD1+) lymphocytes and more mature (CD1-) lymphocytes, while the cortical thymomas have many CD1+ lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some multivariate analyses suggest that invasion is the only important prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], the prognosis is probably multifactorial, with histologic features, staging, and completeness of resection contributing to the clinical behavior of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and management of thymoma and thymic carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although CT imaging can document extensive local invasion, the best determination of the invasive growth of a thymoma is by the surgeon at the time of operation. </p><p>The presence or absence of capsular invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73210\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73210 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>] should be stated in the pathology report. Inking of the tumor capsule at the time of gross evaluation can be helpful in determining the completeness of the resection. As noted previously, communication between the surgeon and pathologist about the operative findings is very important, particularly if the tumor invades the lung, pleura, or any structures in the mediastinum.</p><p>Thymomas may be adherent to adjacent structures without invasion. In such cases, the surgeon should designate the site of adhesion on the specimen, so the pathologist can take careful sections from that area. An inflammatory fibrous reaction can also lead to the false impression of tumor invasion.</p><p>For staging purposes, thymomas can be divided into encapsulated, invasive, or metastatic tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111399 \">table 3</a>). Invasion may be identified either grossly or microscopically. While one staging system indicated that microscopic invasion into (but not through) the capsule was of prognostic importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], several groups have found that invasion needs to be transcapsular with microscopic invasion into adjacent mediastinal tissue before it impacts upon outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Staging of thymomas, including the impact of invasion on prognosis, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and management of thymoma and thymic carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THYMIC CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terminology of thymic neoplasms is confusing. Historically, &quot;malignant thymoma&quot; has been used to refer to invasive thymoma (type I malignant thymoma) as well as thymic carcinoma (type II malignant thymoma). Subsequently, other authors used the terms &quot;encapsulated thymoma&quot;, &quot;truly invasive thymoma&quot;, and &quot;thymic carcinoma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24</a>]. In the current WHO classification, thymic carcinoma is separated from thymoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53024 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Thymic carcinoma has a distinctive morphology and biology. It is composed of highly atypical cells with cytoarchitectural features of carcinoma similar to those seen in other organs. Although many lymphocytes can be seen in its stroma, they are of B cell type and mature T cell type. Thymic carcinoma lacks the immature T cell lymphocytes that are present in thymoma.</p><p>Interestingly, in some tumors there appears to be a continuum of differentiation from thymoma to thymic carcinoma. Carcinoma and thymoma may be found synchronously, or carcinoma may develop within a preexisting thymoma after an interval of 10 to 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Thymic carcinomas have been classified into low-grade and high-grade histologic types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most well-differentiated tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, but this category also includes well-differentiated mucoepidermoid carcinomas and basaloid carcinomas. Most of the high-grade tumors are lymphoepithelial-like carcinomas (non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas), but poorly differentiated mucoepidermoid carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and <span class=\"nowrap\">anaplastic/undifferentiated</span> carcinoma are also encountered.</p><p>The definition of well-differentiated thymic carcinoma is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Many of these fall into the category of epithelial-predominant thymoma according to the traditional classification. The high frequency of myasthenia gravis and excellent survival in patients with well-differentiated thymic carcinoma suggests considerable overlap with epithelial-predominant thymoma. According to the current WHO classification, this category is classified among thymomas rather than thymic carcinomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymic carcinomas are large, firm, infiltrating masses, with frequent areas of cystic change and necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These tumors are encapsulated in 15 percent of cases or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A mucoid cut surface is described in mucoepidermoid carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Multilocular thymic cysts have been reported in association with mucoepidermoid carcinomas and basaloid carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymic carcinomas are cytologically malignant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61840 \">picture 9</a>) and frequently manifest cystic changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79276\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79276 \">picture 10</a>). While a certain amount of necrosis, atypia, and mitoses can be encountered in occasional epithelial thymomas, these findings are common in thymic carcinomas. An infiltrative growth pattern associated with desmoplastic stroma is often seen, without evidence of immature T lymphocytes. The lymphocytes exhibit the phenotype of mature T cells (CD1a-, CD3+, and CD4+ or CD8+). B cell lymphocytes and plasma cells are also seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61840 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p>Thymic carcinomas display a variety of histologic subtypes, emphasizing the ability of thymic epithelium to differentiate in a variety of directions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is composed of cytologically malignant large polygonal cells and a dense lymphoid infiltrate that may obscure the tumor cells.

They are most frequent in the posterior compartment of the mediastinum, where they can cause neurologic symptoms by compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>A variety of benign and malignant tumors of peripheral nerve origin can occur in the mediastinum, among which benign schwannoma (neurilemmoma) is the most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70025\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70025 \">table 7</a>). Mediastinal benign schwannoma originates from Schwann cells and affects patients of both sexes predominantly in the third and fourth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. These tumors can be multiple in patients with neurofibromatosis.</p><p>Mediastinal neurilemmomas are most often asymptomatic, but signs of nerve compression and paralysis, Pancoast syndrome, and Horner's syndrome can occur. Computed tomography reveals a round, well circumscribed mass located in the paravertebral region or intercostal spaces. Focal calcifications and cystic changes are frequent. A characteristic clinico-radiologic feature of these tumors is their extension through an intervertebral foramen, resulting in dumbbell-shaped tumors, and neurologic symptoms of spinal cord compression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Superior pulmonary sulcus (Pancoast) tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Grossly, neurilemmomas are encapsulated, solid, soft, yellow-pink nodules, with the capsule attached to the epineurium of the nerve that gives rise to the neoplasm. Microscopically, they are composed of spindle cells with elongated nuclei, forming interlacing bundles with focal nuclear palisading (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60032\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60032 \">picture 19</a>). Nuclear atypia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71835\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71835 \">picture 20</a>) and stromal sclerosis can be seen in older lesions (&quot;ancient&quot; schwannomas). Mitotic figures are rare. Immunohistochemical studies reveal a strongly positive reaction with S-100 protein.</p><p>Benign mediastinal neurilemmomas are cured by surgical resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">MESENCHYMAL TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either benign or malignant, mesenchymal tumors are rare mediastinal neoplasms (less than 2 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70025\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70025 \">table 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The symptoms are identical to those of other mediastinal masses, and the pathologic features are similar to those of other tumors of soft tissue occurring at other sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of pathologic specimens from the mediastinum requires familiarity with a wide range of neoplasms and careful clinical correlation.
