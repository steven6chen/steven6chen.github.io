Overweight refers to a weight above the &quot;normal&quot; range, with normal defined on the basis of actuarial data. This is determined by calculating the body mass index (BMI, defined as the weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> obesity is defined as a BMI of &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Severe obesity is defined as a BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (or &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in the presence of comorbidities). Although these categorical definitions are clinically useful, it is clear that the risks imparted by increasing body mass follow a continuum.</p><p>An overview of the management of obesity is provided here.

The higher the body mass index (BMI), the greater the risk of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The relationship between BMI and mortality is likely to be similar for all races and ethnicities, but the minimal BMI where excess risk is seen may differ. These risks are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342829129\"><span class=\"h2\">Morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life insurance reports were the first to suggest that lower body weight was associated with lower morbidity and mortality. In subsequent randomized trials, weight loss (via lifestyle or pharmacologic therapy) has been shown to reduce morbidity (reduction in risk factors for cardiovascular disease [CVD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The frequently cited Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) significantly reduced the rate of progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes over a three-year period in participants randomized to intensive lifestyle modification focusing on weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The efficacy of intensive lifestyle modification for diabetes prevention continued over 15 years but was somewhat attenuated over time. There was also a persistent reduction in risk factors for CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Other trials have also reported a beneficial effect of weight loss on risk factors for CVD, including blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and plasma lipid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity, weight reduction, and cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Benefits of weight loss'</a>). Additional benefits of weight loss include reductions in urinary incontinence, sleep apnea, and depression, as well as improvements in quality of life, physical functioning, and mobility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779611484\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no randomized trials that show a reduction in mortality with weight loss, there is evidence from observational and other studies that weight loss in overweight and obese adults is associated with a reduction in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Bariatric surgery has also been associated with a decrease in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical outcomes following bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial, 5145 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> were randomly assigned to an intensive lifestyle intervention (group and individual meetings to achieve weight loss with diet and exercise) or standard diabetes education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After a median follow-up of 9.6 years, the composite primary outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for angina) occurred in a similar number of patients in the intervention and control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Possible reasons for this finding include the lower-than-expected rates of cardiovascular events in both groups, improved overall cardiovascular risk factor treatment with medical therapy (eg, antihypertensives, statins), enrollment of a relatively healthy patient population, and gradual weight loss in the control group such that the differential weight loss between the two groups was only 2.5 percent at study end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Of note, the active intervention group achieved its results with significantly less use of CVD risk-lowering medications than the control group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to management outlined below is based upon the available clinical trial evidence (reviewed in the individual topics) and clinical expertise and is largely in agreement with published guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F93424\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93424 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The goal of therapy is to prevent, reverse, or ameliorate the complications of obesity and improve quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Thus, the selection of patients for treatment is based upon initial risk assessment.</p><p>More than two-thirds of adults in the United States are either trying to lose weight or maintain their weight at any given time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, only 20 percent are both eating fewer calories and engaging in at least 150 minutes of physical activity during leisure time each week. Thus, clinicians can play an important role in educating people regarding the need for and the optimal strategies for losing weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447678688\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of therapy is to prevent, treat, or reverse the complications of obesity. Studies have reported health benefits with weight loss of only 5 percent of body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many patients, however, have a weight loss goal of 30 percent or more below their current weight, a goal that is often not achievable. With lifestyle measures only, an initial weight loss goal of 5 to 7 percent of body weight is more typical. In trials comparing pharmacologic therapy with placebo, weight loss of 10 to 15 percent using both drug and behavioral intervention is considered a very good response, and weight loss exceeding 15 percent is considered an excellent response. Thus, realistic and achievable weight loss goals should be individualized and agreed upon by patient and clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of an individual's overall risk status includes determining the degree of overweight (body mass index [BMI]), the presence of abdominal obesity (waist circumference), and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) or comorbidities (eg, sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). The relationship between BMI and risk allows identification of patients to target for weight loss intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F93424\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93424 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation#H13187471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Assessing obesity-related health risk'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Little or no risk</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>A BMI of 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is associated with little or no increased risk unless waist circumference is high (a marker of increased cardiometabolic risk) or the subject has gained more than 10 kg since age 18 years.

Individuals in the highest risk categories should receive the most aggressive treatment (lifestyle intervention, pharmacologic therapy, bariatric surgery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The second Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS-II) has made recommendations for bariatric surgery for obese patients with type 2 diabetes based upon BMI categories and glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>BMI is calculated as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;BMI &#160;= &#160;body weight (in kg) &#160;&divide; &#160;height squared, in meters</p></div></div><p>The BMI can be estimated from a table or a calculator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63600%7EENDO%2F74762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63600 graphicRef74762 \">table 1A-B</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). BMI is correlated with body fat. Overweight and obesity are defined as a BMI between 25 and 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and a BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> respectively. As noted, an elevated BMI is a necessary but not sufficient basis for treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Body mass index'</a>.)</p><p>Waist circumference is measured with a metal or plastic, nondistensible tape measure, placed around the abdomen parallel to the floor at the level of the iliac crest with the patient standing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77584\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77584 \">figure 2</a>). A waist circumference of &ge;40 inches (102 cm) for men and &ge;35 inches (88 cm) for women is considered elevated and indicative of increased cardiometabolic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the BMI range of 25 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> an increased waist circumference may indicate need for more aggressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Waist circumference'</a>.)</p><p>There is ethnic variability in waist circumference values that predict increased risk. As an example, Japanese Americans and Indians from South Asia have more total fat and visceral fat and therefore may be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes for a given BMI than whites. In Asian females, waist circumference &gt;80 cm (31.5 inches) and in Asian males a value &gt;90 cm (35.4 inches) are considered abnormal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Waist circumference'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of individuals who would benefit from weight loss is a comprehensive lifestyle intervention: a combination of diet, exercise, and behavioral modification. All patients who would benefit from weight loss should receive counseling on diet, exercise, and goals for weight loss. The role of behavioral therapy, diet, and exercise for obesity are all reviewed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Goals of weight loss'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise&quot;</a>). The behavioral component facilitates adherence to diet and exercise regimens. It includes regular self-monitoring of food intake, physical activity, and body weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H985126051\"><span class=\"h3\">Comprehensive lifestyle intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One example of a successful comprehensive lifestyle intervention program is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], subsequently used in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The two major goals of the DPP lifestyle intervention were a minimum of 7 percent weight loss and a minimum of 150 minutes of exercise per week (such as brisk walking). Several behavioral components were used to help achieve these goals, including behavioral self-management training, individual case managers, group <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> individual sessions, individualized adherence strategies, and a network of training, feedback, and clinical support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Using this approach, the DPP reported that lifestyle intervention was more effective for preventing diabetes than a pharmacologic intervention (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although a number of commercially available weight loss programs boast &gt;10 percent weight loss, a meta-analysis of 22 behavioral weight loss studies showed just over 4 percent average loss compared with 1 percent for the control groups, with maximal effect within the first six months after the initiation of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/2,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,21</a>]. Regrettably, as with other therapies for obesity, maintenance of these initial weight losses has been difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. One exception is bariatric surgery, which results in 15 to 30 percent total weight loss that can be sustained for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many types of diets produce modest weight loss. Options include balanced low-calorie, <span class=\"nowrap\">low-fat/low-calorie,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate-fat/low-calorie,</span> and low-carbohydrate diets, as well as the Mediterranean diet. Dietary adherence is an important predictor of weight loss, regardless of the type of diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, we suggest tailoring a diet that reduces energy intake below energy expenditure to individual patient preferences, rather than focusing on the macronutrient composition of the diet. The addition of dietary counseling may facilitate weight loss, particularly during the first year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Types of diets'</a>.)</p><p>Metabolic studies using state-of-the-art techniques have shown all adults will lose weight when fed &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span>. Thus, even subjects who are concerned that they are &quot;metabolically resistant&quot; to weight loss will lose weight if they comply with a diet of 800 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span>. More severe caloric restriction might be expected to induce weight loss more quickly, but a comparison with 400 versus 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> diet formulas showed no difference in weight loss, presumably due to slowing of resting metabolic rate. We thus recommend diets with &gt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Very low calorie diets'</a>.)</p><p>Continued surveillance by both clinician and patient are essential for treatment success. Return visits with the clinician, dietician, or behaviorist should be scheduled at regular intervals to assess barriers, discuss next steps, and offer encouragement. If weight loss is less than 5 percent in the first six months, something else should be tried. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3443093850\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although less potent than dietary restriction in promoting weight loss, increasing energy expenditure through physical activity is a strong predictor of weight loss maintenance. Physical activity should be performed for approximately 30 minutes or more, five to seven days a week, to prevent weight gain and to improve cardiovascular health. There appears to be a dose effect for physical activity and weight loss, and much greater amounts of exercise are necessary to produce significant weight loss in the absence of a calorically restricted diet. Therefore, when weight loss is the desired goal, a diet should be combined with physical activity and the activity should be gradually increased over time as tolerated by the patient. A multicomponent program that includes aerobic and resistance training is preferred. Existing medical conditions, age, and preferences for types of exercise should all be considered in the decisions.

The goal of behavioral therapy is to help patients make long-term changes in their eating behavior by modifying and monitoring their food intake, modifying their physical activity, and controlling cues and stimuli in the environment that trigger eating. These concepts are usually included in programs conducted by psychologists or other trained personnel as well as many self-help groups.

Removal of fat by aspiration after injection of physiologic saline has been used to remove and contour subcutaneous fat. While this can result in a significant reduction in fat mass and weight, it does not appear to improve insulin sensitivity or risk factors for coronary heart disease. This was illustrated in a study of 15 obese women (eight with normal glucose tolerance and seven with type 2 diabetes) who underwent metabolic evaluation before and 10 to 12 weeks after large-volume abdominal liposuction with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liposuction decreased the volume of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue by 44 percent (9 kg) in the women with normal glucose tolerance and by 28 percent (10.5 kg) in those with diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although waist circumference and plasma leptin concentrations were significantly decreased, no improvements in insulin sensitivity of muscle, liver, or adipose tissue were seen in either group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liposuction did not alter plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or adiponectin, and there were no significant improvements in other risk factors for coronary heart disease, including blood pressure, plasma glucose, lipid, or insulin concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Thus, removal of large volumes of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue with liposuction does not improve insulin sensitivity or risk factors for coronary heart disease in obese women with or without type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the negative energy balance induced by decreased nutritional intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> removal of visceral fat are necessary for achieving the metabolic benefits of weight loss.

Examples of dietary supplements include ephedra, green tea, chromium, chitosan, and guar gum. Ephedra and ephedra alkaloids (Ma Huang), a group of ephedrine-like molecules found in plants, have been removed from the market because of safety concerns.

Most of the available drugs have minor side effects that diminish with treatment; however, a few serious side effects have been identified that should preclude short-term use in subjects who wish to lose small amounts of weight (the majority of overweight people). Even with potentially dangerous drugs, chronic treatment may be needed when the magnitude of the obesity carries larger risks, eg, a BMI above 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> or a BMI between 27 and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> with complicating factors such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
