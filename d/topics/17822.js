The rationale is that there is risk for further organ <span class=\"nowrap\">damage/ischemia</span> and progression of anemia unless the underlying cause of the deficiency is addressed and adequate iron stores are replenished. An exception is when iron depletion is used therapeutically (eg, porphyria cutanea tarda, polycythemia vera). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis#H514912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Phlebotomy'</a> and <a href=\"#H1941331699\" class=\"local\">'Myeloproliferative syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9250414\"><span class=\"h3\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with iron deficiency anemia will be asymptomatic; others will have symptoms that may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of anemia, which may include weakness, headache, decreased exercise tolerance, fatigue, irritability, or depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodevelopmental delay (children)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pica and pagophagia (ice craving)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beeturia (reddish urine after eating beets)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restless legs syndrome</p><p/><p>Similar symptoms, especially fatigue and exercise intolerance, can also be present in individuals who are iron deficient but not anemic. These symptoms and their pathophysiology are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H20317248\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations of IDA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>When treatment is indicated, the usual approach is repletion of iron. Blood transfusion should <strong>not </strong>be used a treatment for iron deficiency unless the individual has severe anemia or hemodynamic instability. (See <a href=\"#H1768578822\" class=\"local\">'Severe/life-threatening anemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9250420\"><span class=\"h3\">Iron deficiency without anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some individuals with reduced or absent iron stores who have not yet developed anemia may have symptoms such as fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance.</p><p>The approach to therapy is individualized according to etiology and severity of iron deficiency. We replace iron stores in most patients who have iron deficiency without anemia, with the rationale that this treatment is likely to improve symptoms, and failure to treat is likely eventually to result in anemia. These patients are often referred to the hematologist after iron studies reveal iron deficiency as part of screening laboratory tests performed to evaluate fatigue or unexplained microcytosis.</p><p>The benefit of iron replacement for iron deficiency-associated fatigue without anemia has been demonstrated in several small trials and observational studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial randomly assigned 90 non-anemic premenopausal women with fatigue, serum ferritin &le;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and hemoglobin &ge;12.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to receive a cumulative dose of 800 mg of intravenous (IV) iron or placebo over two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Six weeks after treatment initiation, fatigue was improved in the IV iron arm (decrease of 1.1 versus 0.7 on a 10-point scale, from a baseline of 4.5 in both groups). The effect was more pronounced in those with a baseline serum ferritin &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span>. Benefits of iron supplementation persisted at 12 weeks. Adverse events were greater in the IV iron group (21 versus 9 percent), but none were considered serious. As expected, the IV iron group had increased ferritin (mean increase, 98 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> and the placebo group did not. Observational studies have also reported improvement in symptoms in non-anemic premenopausal women with low ferritin who were treated with IV iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three trials that randomly assigned groups of non-anemic women with low ferritin to oral iron supplementation (typically 80 mg of elemental iron daily) versus placebo or a high-iron diet all reported improvement in fatigue with oral iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The trial that used dietary iron as a comparator also found improvement with dietary iron, but mean increases in ferritin were greater in the supplement group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional trials in runners and blood donors have demonstrated that iron repletion can improve athletic performance, sleep disturbance, and fingernail breakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3049021862\" class=\"local\">'Athletes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>These data are supportive of the above recommendation that iron should be repleted in those with iron deficiency without anemia. The importance of finding the source of blood loss or iron loss also applies in these individuals. (See <a href=\"#H219997\" class=\"local\">'Source of deficiency/blood loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Routine iron administration to individuals without iron deficiency is not advised. Rarely, some experts will treat a patient who has symptoms compatible with iron deficiency (eg, restless legs syndrome) without overt laboratory evidence of reduced iron stores if all other interventions have been exhausted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults#H1663765\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Iron replacement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219997\"><span class=\"h2\">Source of deficiency/blood loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia involves more than simply replacing iron. In <strong>all patients</strong>, the cause of iron deficiency must be identified and addressed. This is especially true for men and non-menstruating women, in whom new onset iron deficiency is strongly suggestive of blood loss from an occult gastrointestinal malignancy or other bleeding lesion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dietary deficiency</strong> &ndash; Infants and young children may not receive adequate dietary iron if they are exclusively given cow&rsquo;s milk, breast milk, or formula that is not supplemented with iron. For adults in resource-rich countries, dietary iron deficiency is exceedingly rare because of iron availability in many meats (as heme iron) and vegetables (as non-heme iron), along with routine supplementation of grains with iron. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impaired absorption</strong> &ndash; Certain gastrointestinal conditions may lead to iron deficiency due to impaired absorption. Examples include inflammatory bowel disease and gastric bypass surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric surgery: Postoperative nutritional management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Pregnancy results in increased iron requirements for <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/placental</span> development and to increase maternal red blood cell mass. Total iron loss associated with pregnancy and lactation is approximately 1000 mg. Iron deficiency may be seen, especially in women with multiple pregnancies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> borderline iron status prior to pregnancy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Menstruating women &ndash; Normal menstruation does not lead to iron deficiency. However, abnormal uterine <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/menorrhagia</span> has been reported to cause iron deficiency anemia in one-fifth to two-thirds of affected women. Approaches to determining the site and cause of bleeding are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-evaluation-and-approach-to-diagnosis#H502482930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Evaluation and approach to diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Approach to diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other known bleeding site &ndash; Other known bleeding sites include gastrointestinal lesions, telangiectasias associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, also called Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome), and renal pulmonary syndromes. Specific lesions may be amenable to surgical or medical intervention in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia-osler-weber-rendu-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adults without an obvious source of blood loss &ndash; Adults without an obvious source of blood loss must be evaluated for occult gastrointestinal malignancy unless there is a clear reason not to do so. This is especially true for individuals &gt;50 years of age, non-menstruating women, and those at increased risk of colorectal cancer based on family history or other risk factors.

Compared with controls, women with iron deficiency anemia were at increased risk of transfusion (odds ratio [OR] 5.48; 95% CI 4.57-6.58), preterm delivery (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.36-1.76), and cesarean delivery (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.13-1.49). Increased adverse fetal outcomes included 5-minute Apgar &lt;7 (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.84-2.64), intensive care admission (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.04-1.57), macrosomia (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.12-1.35), and large for gestational age (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.20-1.39). Anemic women were also more likely to be younger and multiparous.</p><p>We often use intravenous (IV) iron to treat iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in our practice, in order to avoid the gastrointestinal side effects of oral iron; these may be compounded by pregnancy-associated bloating and constipation due to high progesterone levels and the pressure of the gravid uterus on the rectum. We routinely administer 1000 mg of low molecular weight <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-dextran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron dextran</a> (LMW ID) in one hour to iron deficient pregnant women in the second or third trimester, whether or not they are intolerant of oral iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The efficacy of this approach was demonstrated in a study in which 73 women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy were treated with LMW ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mean hemoglobin level increased from 9.7 to 10.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and the mean ferritin increased from 15 to 126 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Six individuals had minor infusion reactions that resolved spontaneously after interruption of the infusion for 15 to 30 minutes, after which the remainder of the dose was given after premedication with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Allergic and infusion reactions'</a> below). We have not observed any serious adverse effects in over 2000 pregnant patients treated. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous iron'</a> below.)</p><p>The efficacy of this approach was demonstrated in a series of 189 consecutive pregnant women with hemoglobin &lt;10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> who were treated with 1000 mg of IV LMW ID during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The full dose was administered over one hour after a test dose and without premedications, with the exception of individuals with a history of asthma or multiple drug allergies who were given 125 mg of IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>. There were no serious adverse events, and hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Four patients (2 percent) had a transient infusion reaction (sneezing, congestion, myalgias) treated with brief interruption of the infusion (10 to 15 minutes) and one dose of methylprednisolone, followed by administration of the remainder of the dose.</p><p>However, not all women will have access to (or choose to receive) IV iron. For these individuals, anemia due to iron deficiency can be treated by adding an oral iron supplement to the standard prenatal vitamin, as discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy#H717781762\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Iron'</a>). Approaches to reducing the gastrointestinal toxicities of oral iron are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H230894239\" class=\"local\">'Strategies to improve tolerability'</a> below.)</p><p>A 2011 Cochrane review of randomized trials for the treatment of iron deficiency in pregnancy found that iron supplementation was effective in treating maternal anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some studies showed better improvements in anemia with parenteral versus oral iron and others did not. Fetal outcomes were similar with oral versus IV iron repletion, but fetal outcomes with iron supplementation versus placebo were not evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Oral iron was associated with increased frequency of abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, itching and rash; intramuscular iron was associated with pain at the injection site. From the standpoint of the developing fetus, iron repletion, as well as a more liberal use of IV iron in pregnancy, will likely minimize the chance that the neonate of an iron-deficient woman will also be iron deficient, especially in view of evidence that iron-deficient neonates have delayed growth and development and an increase in behavioral problems that persist up to 10 years after iron repletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The safety and efficacy of IV iron in pregnancy has been illustrated by a number of small trials and case series that have found IV iron to be as good or better than oral iron without serious adverse events; however, most of these were too small to allow extensive safety evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/12,13,18-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,18-24</a>]. As noted above, we reserve IV iron for the second and third trimesters, as safety during the first trimester has not been established.</p><p>If iron was not repleted (or incompletely repleted) during pregnancy, it may be administered postpartum. However, delaying iron repletion until after delivery is not advised, because this practice is likely to leave the infant iron deficient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3311278776\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older individuals may become iron deficient for a number of reasons. As noted above, a search for the cause of new onset iron deficiency is mandatory for all older individuals for whom a new underlying lesion would be treated.

Lower doses of iron may be effective and at the same time cause less gastrointestinal toxicity.

For many years, the recommended daily dose for the treatment of iron deficiency in adults has been in the range of 150 to 200 mg of elemental iron daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106069 \">table 3</a>). As an example, a 325 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> tablet contains 65 mg of elemental iron per tablet; three tablets per day will provide 195 mg of elemental iron, of which approximately 25 mg is absorbed and used in production of heme and other molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, the best way to administer oral iron is an area of active study, with increasing evidence suggesting that alternate-day dosing (taking the iron every other day rather than every day) may result in better iron absorption than daily dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Thus, we typically advise our patients to take this dose every other day as long as they can manage the schedule appropriately; a reasonable variation on the schedule that is easier to follow is to give the dose on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The following evidence is relevant in this regard:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intriguing findings from a study of the response of 54 iron-deficient women to daily oral iron suggest that giving multiple doses per day could cause a paradoxical decrease in iron absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. These women with depleted iron stores (ferritin &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> but without anemia were given various doses of oral iron that contained a traceable isotope to track absorption. Iron absorption was best when dosing was restricted to lower doses and less frequent administration (40 to 80 mg of iron no more than once a day). Higher or more frequent doses of iron raised circulating hepcidin levels and <strong>reduced</strong> subsequent fractional iron absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent pair of trials assessed absorption in 60 women ages 18 to 40 years with iron deficiency (ferritin &le;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL;</span> most were not anemic) who were given isotope-labeled iron at different schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In the first trial, 20 women were randomly assigned to receive same total oral daily dose of iron (120 mg of FeSO<sub>4</sub>) as a single dose or divided into two doses; this showed no difference in absorption. In the second trial, 40 women were randomly assigned to receive oral iron (60 mg of FeSO<sub>4</sub>) once daily for 14 days or once every other day for 28 days (same cumulative dose). Compared with daily dosing, every other day dosing resulted in <strong>greater</strong> iron absorption (131 versus 175 mg total). There was a trend towards decreased nausea in the every other day group that did not reach statistical significance; constipation was not assessed. It is possible that individuals assigned to alternate-day dosing were more likely to take the assigned medication; if true, this does not diminish the potential value of this approach. Additional concerns with the trial included lack of central randomization and lack of blinding; trials that address these concerns are eagerly awaited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p>Older individuals may have greater toxicity from oral iron and may be treated with lower doses, although there is a lack of high quality evidence to guide dosing in older adults. In a randomized study in 90 hospitalized patients &gt;80 years of age who had iron deficiency anemia, daily doses of 15, 50, or 150 mg of elemental iron for two months were equally effective in raising hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations, while adverse side effects were significantly less common at the lower iron doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When using oral iron to treat older adults with iron deficiency, we typically use 10 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> oral elixir mixed in one-fifth of a glass of orange juice (to enhance absorption) and taken 30 minutes before breakfast, every other day. This provides 88 mg of elemental iron per dose. The dose can be reduced to 5 mL if the 10 mL dose causes irritation. An ascorbic acid (vitamin C) tablet can be substituted for the orange juice. Another option is to give a dose of oral iron once daily on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. (See <a href=\"#H3311278776\" class=\"local\">'Older adults'</a> above.)</p><p>The bioavailability and absorption of oral iron may be enhanced by attention to the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64874 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food</strong> &ndash; Phosphates, phytates, and tannates in foods may bind iron and impair its absorption.

In a series of 12 individuals treated with iron during intake of a normal or vitamin C-supplemented diet, the absolute dose of vitamin C did not appear to have a major effect on iron absorption, and the increase in iron absorption with vitamin C was modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p>As noted above, enteric-coated or sustained-release capsules are less efficient for oral absorption because they release iron too far distally in the intestine (or not at all). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Choice of oral preparation'</a> above.)</p><p>The duration of treatment differs among experts and in different settings. Some stop treatment when the hemoglobin level normalizes because this allows early detection of recurrent anemia from further blood loss (eg, following therapy for a gastric lesion). Others treat for at least six months after the hemoglobin has normalized in order to completely replenish iron stores (eg, following delivery for a multigravid woman). Treatment with oral iron may take as long as six to eight weeks in order to fully ameliorate the anemia, and as long as six months to replete iron stores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects (oral iron)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal side effects are extremely common with oral iron administration.

This was demonstrated in a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of trials that randomly assigned patients to IV iron versus oral iron or no iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Patients in the IV iron arms had a lower frequency of blood transfusions (risk ratio [RR] 0.74; 95% CI 0.62-0.88). The meta-analysis included trials in a number of conditions, including chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, surgery, and pregnancy, among others (see <a href=\"#H1809132799\" class=\"local\">'Patient populations'</a> above). Additional randomized trials published subsequently, such as a 2016 trial in 252 pregnant women, have also found that compared to oral iron, IV iron has similar efficacy in improving hemoglobin level and fewer adverse events, including markedly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

We generally treat patients who have uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia with oral iron due to the ease of administration. However, the availability of IV iron formulations with improved toxicity profiles has lowered the threshold at which many patients would prefer an IV preparation. We often use IV iron when treating pregnant women and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, gastric surgery, or chronic kidney disease.

The dose of oral iron depends on patient age, the estimated iron deficit, the rapidity with which it needs to be corrected, and side effects, which include metallic taste, and a number of gastrointestinal effects that generally correlate with dose. For individuals treated with oral iron, we suggest that the dose be taken every other day rather than every day (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is based on evidence in individuals with iron deficiency that demonstrates improved absorption and reduced gastrointestinal side effects. Other strategies to improve tolerability are listed above.

We do not use routine premedication prior to IV iron and we avoid diphenhydramine. For individuals with asthma, inflammatory rheumatic conditions, or multiple drug allergies, we generally limit premedication to a glucocorticoid alone.

Some of these additional diagnoses, such as celiac disease, may be especially important to evaluate.
