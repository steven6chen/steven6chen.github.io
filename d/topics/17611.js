Although this disorder was initially thought to follow a benign course, it is now recognized that slow progression to end-stage renal disease occurs in up to 50 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], often over 20 to 25 years of observation. The remaining patients enter a sustained clinical remission or have persistent low-grade hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria. Although the prognosis may be difficult to predict in some individuals, important risk factors for progressive renal disease have been identified. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical predictors of progression'</a> below.)</p><p>There are two major clinical presentations of IgA nephropathy: gross hematuria, often recurrent, following shortly after an upper respiratory infection or athletic exertion; and persistent asymptomatic microscopic hematuria with or without mild to moderate proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The diagnosis requires a kidney biopsy, which, as described below, often provides prognostic information. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Histologic predictors of progression'</a> below.)</p><p>The renal prognosis and treatment of IgA nephropathy will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy and the outcomes in patients who undergo renal transplantation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA nephropathy: Recurrence after transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with IgA nephropathy who have little or no proteinuria (less than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> usually have a low risk of progression. However, progressive proteinuria and renal insufficiency develop in a substantial proportion of patients over the long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Among patients who develop overt proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated serum creatinine concentration, progression to end-stage renal disease is approximately 15 to 25 percent at 10 years and 20 to 30 percent at 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/3,4,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11-14</a>].</p><p>The rate of progression is typically slow with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often falling by as little as 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year, a change not associated with an elevation in the serum creatinine concentration in the short term. Thus, a stable and normal serum creatinine concentration does not necessarily indicate stable disease. The frequency with which this occurs has been evaluated in studies in which repeat renal biopsy was used to assess the frequency of progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In one report, repeat renal biopsies were performed at five years in 73 patients with persistent proteinuria and a normal or near-normal initial serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Histologic improvement occurred in only 4 percent, with 41 percent remaining stable and 55 percent showing progressive glomerular and secondary vascular and tubulointerstitial injury. An increase in serum creatinine to more than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> was associated with major pathologic lesions.</p><p>These observations and those in the following sections are generally from patients with biopsy-confirmed IgA nephropathy in which some factor other than hematuria prompted the biopsy, such as proteinuria or an elevated serum creatinine concentration. In many countries, such as the United States, patients who have only hematuria are often not biopsied. However, such individuals should be monitored periodically because progression to proteinuria and impaired renal function can occur. (See <a href=\"#H450429\" class=\"local\">'Hematuria without proteinuria'</a> below.)</p><p>The potential impact of biopsy criteria on prognosis was evaluated in a retrospective study that evaluated geographic differences in the clinical course of 711 patients with a biopsy diagnosis of IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Renal survival at 10 years was 96, 87, 64, and 62 percent in Finland, Australia, Scotland, and Canada, respectively. The better outcomes in Finland and Australia were largely, although not completely, attributable to the diagnosis of milder cases (eg, less proteinuria, higher creatinine clearance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower blood pressure). This raises the possibility of lead-time bias influencing the prognosis, as opposed to a better prognosis in some geographic areas compared with others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical predictors of progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with IgA nephropathy who develop progressive disease typically have one or more of the following clinical or laboratory findings at the time of diagnosis, each of which is a marker for more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/3,4,8-12,18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8-12,18-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum creatinine concentration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;140/90</span> mmHg) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent (eg, for more than six months) protein excretion above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453254\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A reduction in GFR, as manifested by an elevated serum creatinine concentration at diagnosis or during the course of the disease, is associated with a worse renal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/3,11,12,22,23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12,22,23,25,26</a>]. The magnitude of the effect of reduced GFR on prognosis was illustrated in a study from Japan of 2270 patients with IgA nephropathy in which the cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease at seven years varied directly and markedly with the serum creatinine (SCr) at diagnosis (p value for the trend &lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCr &le;1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (111 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> &ndash; 2.5 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCr 1.26 to 1.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (111 to 147 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> &ndash; 26 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCr &gt;1.68 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&gt;148 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> &ndash; 71 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452224\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When present at diagnosis, hypertension or a significant elevation in blood pressure (eg, from <span class=\"nowrap\">100/60</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg) is predictive of a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/10,20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20,24</a>].

The cumulative incidence of dialysis or death was much higher in patients with hypertension (defined as <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;140/90</span> mmHg) at disease discovery compared with those without hypertension (15 versus 3 percent and 41 versus 6 percent at 10 and 20 years, respectively).</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a second prospective study of 542 patients with IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A higher mean arterial pressure was associated with a higher risk of progressive renal disease, an effect that was seen at all levels of proteinuria. However, as described in the next section, the degree of proteinuria was the most important predictor of renal outcome.</p><p>It is thought that the adverse prognosis associated with hypertension is primarily related to its being a marker of more severe glomerular disease. However, if untreated, hypertension can directly contribute to progressive kidney disease.

This study also confirmed the above observation that sustained proteinuria less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> could be used as a practical definition of partial remission in IgA nephropathy. Over the long term, the incidence of dialysis or death was much lower in patients who achieved a reduction in protein excretion to less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> with treatment compared with those with persistent protein excretion above this level (2 versus 29 percent and 2 versus 67 percent at 10 and 20 years, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in an observational study of 542 patients with IgA nephropathy who were followed for a mean of 6.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The rate of decline in renal function was 24 times faster in patients with sustained proteinuria of more than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> compared with patients with persistent protein excretion below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (0.72 versus 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per month) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65711 \">figure 1</a>). Patients who presented with protein excretion above 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> who attained a partial remission (less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> had a similar rate of progression to renal failure as patients with sustained proteinuria from presentation of less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78495 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from China, patients with less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> had significantly better outcomes than patients excreting 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, data regarding the effect of lowering proteinuria to different levels were not provided, in contrast to the above study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78495 \">figure 2</a>). Thus, the better prognosis in patients with protein excretion below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> could have reflected less severe disease or better blood pressure control.</p><p/><p>Among patients with IgA nephropathy, proteinuria measured by any method is predictive of disease progression. A spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) may be better at predicting disease progression than other methods of quantifying proteinuria. One study of 438 Chinese patients with IgA nephropathy compared the association of urine ACR, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), and 24-hour urine protein excretion (UPE) with disease severity and progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In all patients, urine ACR and PCR were quantified at the time of kidney biopsy; 24-hour UPE was measured within a few days of the procedure. All three tests correlated well with the severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD), presence of hypertension, and extent of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis on kidney biopsy. Urine ACR, compared with PCR and 24-hour UPE, was slightly better at predicting disease progression (a composite end point of &ge;30 percent reduction in estimated GFR [eGFR], end-stage renal disease, or death).</p><p>However, the association between the urine ACR and prognostic outcomes may be confounded by the fact that low urinary creatinine excretion is an independent predictor of end-stage renal disease and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A low urinary creatinine excretion can cause a spurious increase in urine ACR, but not 24-hour UPE. In this setting, it may be difficult to differentiate the adverse prognostic implications of high urinary albumin excretion versus low urinary creatinine excretion. A urine ACR corrected for estimated creatinine excretion may improve the accuracy of albuminuria assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Even the degree of proteinuria by dipstick at the baseline evaluation has predictive value. This was demonstrated in a report from Japan of 2270 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy who were surveyed three, five, and eight years after the baseline survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The seven-year cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease was 0.7 percent in patients who had no or trace proteinuria at presentation compared with 6.4, 18.3, and 30.9 percent in patients with 1+, 2+, and 3+ proteinuria at presentation. The urine albumin concentration ranged from less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> with a negative or trace positive dipstick to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or more with a 3+ dipstick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83037486\"><span class=\"h4\">Acute onset of nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrotic-range proteinuria can occur in more severe IgA nephropathy and is an adverse predictor of prognosis. However, some patients have an acute onset of nephrotic syndrome and renal biopsy reveals only mild mesangial proliferation, with the most prominent finding being diffuse fusion of the foot processes on electron microscopy, similar to that seen in minimal change (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58414 \">picture 1</a>). Furthermore, many of these patients behave as if they have minimal change disease, as remission of the nephrotic syndrome can be induced with glucocorticoid therapy. Whether these patients actually have IgA nephropathy is unclear. IgA nephropathy may also overlap with membranous nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults#H445388995\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minimal change disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid therapy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450429\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematuria without proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have recurrent episodes of gross hematuria without proteinuria are at low risk for progressive kidney disease compared with patients who have persistent microscopic hematuria and proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/3,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32</a>]. In addition, isolated persistent hematuria (ie, with little or no proteinuria) at presentation may be associated with progressive disease over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/8,11,12,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12,33</a>]. The following observations are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from China, 72 consecutive patients with IgA nephropathy who underwent renal biopsy because of hematuria with no or minimal proteinuria (defined as less than 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> were followed for a median of seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Protein excretion above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> hypertension, and impaired renal function (serum creatinine &ge;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [120 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> developed in 33, 26, and 7 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from Israel found persistent asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria (proteinuria less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> in 3690 young adults (0.3 percent of 1.2 million eligible individuals) who were examined for fitness for military service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 16 years, treated end-stage renal disease occurred significantly more often than in those without hematuria (0.70 versus 0.05 percent, adjusted hazard ratio 18.5). Four of the 26 patients had progressive disease had IgA nephropathy on renal biopsy.</p><p/><p>Some patients with isolated hematuria (ie, no significant proteinuria or renal dysfunction at presentation) undergo remission of abnormal laboratory findings, with reported rates ranging from 5 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/13,15-18,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-18,34</a>]. Remission appears to occur most often in children. This was illustrated in a study of 181 Japanese children diagnosed by renal biopsy before the age of 15 years; 30 percent had proliferative glomerulonephritis and were treated with immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Renal biopsy in these patients reveals mesangial proliferation and segmental crescents in a small proportion of glomeruli (usually less than 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/35,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37,38</a>]. These findings are insufficient to account for the AKI, which has been ascribed to tubular obstruction by red cell casts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/36,37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,39</a>]. However, the most common histologic lesion is acute tubular necrosis, which may be induced by the iron released from lysed red cells in the tubules, possibly acting via the local generation of toxic oxygen free radicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/36,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38,39</a>].</p><p>The serum creatinine concentration typically returns to baseline levels within several weeks to months, although dialysis may be temporarily required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Significant risk factors for lack of complete recovery included duration of gross hematuria longer than 10 days, age greater than 50 years, decreased eGFR at baseline, and more severe tubular necrosis on renal biopsy.</p><p>One concern in such patients with known IgA nephropathy is that transformation to crescentic disease, which has a different prognosis and requires immediate therapy, can present in a similar fashion.

The slow rate of loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) seen in many patients (1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year) hinders the ability to perform adequate studies.

(See <a href=\"#H450429\" class=\"local\">'Hematuria without proteinuria'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent proteinuria (above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or perhaps above 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> a normal or only slightly reduced GFR that is not declining rapidly, and only mild to moderate histologic findings on renal biopsy are initially managed with nonimmunosuppressive therapies to slow progression.

This classification may also allow the identification of features that are steroid responsive. This was suggested in the original Oxford classification and also seen in the North American IgA nephropathy validation study, in which patients with endocapillary proliferation who received immunosuppressive therapy (largely corticosteroids) had a markedly lower rate of decline in GFR than those who did not receive this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, such an observation does not prove cause-and-effect.

As a result, clinical parameters are typically used, whether or not the patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. The major parameters that are serially monitored are the urine sediment, serum creatinine concentration or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and protein excretion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematuria</strong> &ndash; Persistent hematuria is generally a marker of persistent immunologic activity, but not necessarily of progressive disease. Hematuria alone does not require any form of therapy but monitoring over time is essential since some patients develop proteinuria and progressive disease. (See <a href=\"#H450429\" class=\"local\">'Hematuria without proteinuria'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Proteinuria</strong> &ndash; Protein excretion above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> is a marker of more severe disease and is a major risk factor for disease progression unless the degree of proteinuria is reduced. (See <a href=\"#H449899\" class=\"local\">'Protein excretion above 1 g/day'</a> above.) Because of the prognostic importance of the degree of proteinuria, we suggest an initial 24-hour urine collection for both protein and creatinine. The completeness of the 24-hour urine collection can be estimated from the rate of creatinine excretion. Normal values of creatinine excretion vary with age: in patients under the age of 50 years, 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> estimated lean body weight in men and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> estimated lean body weight in women; and, in patients between the ages of 50 and 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to as low as 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> estimated lean body weight in men). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20663247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Limitations of using creatinine clearance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the initial 24-hour urine collection seems complete, then the rate of protein excretion is probably an accurate estimate. In this setting, the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on this specimen can be related to the total amount of proteinuria, and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on a random specimen can subsequently be used to monitor the degree of proteinuria, as long as muscle mass appears stable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Increasing proteinuria may be due to ongoing active disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> secondary glomerular injury due to nonimmunologic progression. It is often not possible to distinguish between these two possibilities, except for a rapid increase in protein excretion, which is usually associated with active disease. Issues related to secondary factors and progression of any cause of proteinuric chronic kidney disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Protein excretion often falls with therapy with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, and the degree of proteinuria is one of the major end points of such therapy. Protein excretion also may fall spontaneously, particularly during recovery from an acute episode, following effective immunosuppressive therapy, and perhaps in children. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin inhibition'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum creatinine</strong> &ndash; The serum creatinine concentration, unless it is rapidly rising, permits an estimation of the GFR. As noted above, most patients with chronic IgA nephropathy have stable or slowly progressive disease. The rate of loss of GFR is often as low as 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year, a change that may not raise the serum creatinine level to above normal values for a number of years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Because of a compensatory rise in single-nephron GFR among less injured glomeruli, a stable normal serum creatinine level or estimated total kidney eGFR does not necessarily indicate stable disease.

The target blood pressure was less than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg, and initially normotensive patients received a fixed dose of antihypertensive drugs. Blood pressure control throughout the study was similar in the two groups. At follow-up of about six years, renal survival, defined as less than a 50 percent increase in the serum creatinine concentration, was significantly more likely in the enalapril group (92 versus 55 percent) and a significant decrease in proteinuria was only observed in the enalapril group (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> at baseline versus 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> at the last visit). The proteinuria decline after one year of therapy correlated with renal survival.

Only five patients were hypertensive. At a median follow-up of 38 months, the primary end point (greater than a 30 percent decrease in creatinine clearance) was reached by only a few patients and significant efficacy could not be determined. However, benazepril therapy did result in a significantly lower incidence of the secondary composite end point (greater than 30 percent decrease in creatinine clearance or worsening of proteinuria until the nephrotic range was reached, 3 versus 27 percent) and a higher incidence of a partial (41 versus 9 percent) or complete remission of proteinuria (13 versus 0 percent). Although blood pressures were higher in the placebo group in the last one to two years of the study, the effect of blood pressure on outcomes was probably small since differences were not observed in the first three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Benefit from angiotensin inhibition was also seen in two observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].

The 27 patients who were treated with an ACE inhibitor, when compared with the 55 patients treated with other antihypertensive drugs, had the following significant benefits: a slower rate of loss of creatinine clearance (0.4 versus 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per month), a longer time to loss of one-third of creatinine clearance, and a higher frequency of remission of proteinuria (18.5 versus 1.8 percent). When compared with the 33 patients who were not treated with antihypertensive drugs, the patients treated with an ACE inhibitor had the same rates of fall in creatinine clearance and progression to renal failure and a higher rate of remission of proteinuria, despite having more severe histologic changes on renal biopsy and a higher initial serum creatinine.</p><p>By contrast, angiotensin inhibition does not appear to be beneficial in non-proteinuric patients or those with low levels of protein excretion. This was shown in a trial of 60 Chinese patients with IgA nephropathy, proteinuria below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> normal kidney function, and blood pressure below <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

The primary end point of the analysis was a renal event, defined as a doubling of serum creatinine, a 50 percent decline in GFR, or end-stage renal disease, depending upon the study. The nine trials were heterogenous with respect to the glucocorticoid regimen (eg, high- versus low-dose, short- versus long-term), duration of follow-up (6 months to 10 years), the use of a placebo control, and concurrent therapy with ACE inhibitors. The major findings were as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid therapy significantly reduced the incidence of renal events compared with the control (2.4 versus 15 percent; relative risk reduction 0.32 [95% CI 0.15 to 0.67]).

Also, patients receiving immunosuppression had a higher rate of infections, impaired glucose tolerance, and weight gain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although this trial suggests that immunosuppressive therapy might not help preserve kidney function in patients with IgA nephropathy, the findings are not directly applicable to our treatment suggestions (see <a href=\"#H284610036\" class=\"local\">'Indications for glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above). The inclusion of patients with less severe proteinuria (ie, &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> and possibly patients with chronic fibrotic disease (no morphologic data was reported) may have obscured a beneficial effect of glucocorticoid monotherapy.

Slow progression to end-stage renal disease occurs in up to 50 percent of affected patients, often over 20 to 25 years of observation. The remaining patients enter a sustained clinical remission or have persistent low-grade hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical predictors of progression of IgA nephropathy include elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and persistent protein excretion above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Patients who have recurrent episodes of gross hematuria without proteinuria are at low risk for progressive kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical predictors of progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic findings on renal biopsy in patients with IgA nephropathy have been associated with an increased risk of progressive disease. These include both markers of more severe inflammatory disease, such as crescent formation, and immune deposits in the capillary loops in addition to the mesangial deposits that are present in all patients, and markers of chronic fibrotic disease such as glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and vascular disease. The Oxford classification is a pathologic classification that identified several variables that correlated with adverse renal outcomes independent of the clinical features, including mesangial proliferation, endocapillary proliferation, segmental glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. It has been validated in numerous cohorts. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Histologic predictors of progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute kidney injury can occur in patients during episodes of gross hematuria. This is usually due to acute tubular necrosis, and the serum creatinine concentration typically returns to baseline levels within several weeks. However, acute kidney injury can also represent transformation to crescentic disease, which requires immediate therapy. Among patients with IgA nephropathy who have an acute deterioration of renal function that does not improve within a maximum of a week's observation, we suggest a repeat renal biopsy to exclude crescentic disease. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury with gross hematuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19826620\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two major approaches to the therapy of IgA nephropathy (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonimmunosuppressive therapies to slow progression, including blood pressure control and, in patients with proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs); and fish oil. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids, with or without other immunosuppressive agents, to treat the underlying inflammatory disease. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with isolated hematuria, no or minimal proteinuria (less than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> and a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are typically not treated and often not biopsied and therefore not identified as having IgA nephropathy. However, these patients should be periodically monitored at 6- to 12-month intervals since there is an appreciable rate of progressive disease as manifested by increases in proteinuria, blood pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"#H450429\" class=\"local\">'Hematuria without proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent proteinuria (above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or perhaps above 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> a normal or only slightly reduced GFR that is not declining rapidly, and only mild to moderate histologic findings on renal biopsy are <strong>initially</strong> managed with nonimmunosuppressive therapies to slow progression. The sequence of nonimmunosuppressive therapy is as follows (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive therapies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angiotensin inhibition with either an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The goals of therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB are a urinary protein excretion below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and a blood pressure less than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin inhibition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Proteinuria and blood pressure goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fish oil (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or more), which can be tried in patients with protein excretion above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> despite three to six months of therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Fish oil may have cardiovascular benefits and is unlikely to be harmful. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Fish oil'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest anti-inflammatory therapy with glucocorticoids in patients with clinical features supporting active disease and progression, which include hematuria in addition to one or more of the following (see <a href=\"#H284610036\" class=\"local\">'Indications for glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids as sole immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An increasing serum creatinine </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent proteinuria above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> after maximal antiproteinuric nonimmunosuppressive therapies </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Morphologic evidence of active disease based upon kidney biopsy (eg, proliferative or necrotizing glomerular changes) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, we suggest <strong>not</strong> treating with glucocorticoids in patients with a chronically elevated serum creatinine or morphologic evidence of prominent glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial atrophy or fibrosis (see <a href=\"#H888782229\" class=\"local\">'Lack of benefit in chronic fibrotic disease'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either of the following two regimens is acceptable in patients with IgA nephropathy who are selected for glucocorticoid therapy (see <a href=\"#H1392575\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid regimen'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, 1 g, for three consecutive days at the beginning of months 1, 3, and 5, combined with 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> given on alternate days for six months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a>, 0.8 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, for two months followed by monthly dose reductions of 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day during the next four months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined immunosuppressive therapy can be considered in patients with more severe disease as defined by a more rapidly progressive clinical course <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histologic evidence of severe active inflammation (eg, crescent formation).

These histologic findings are characteristic of minimal change disease. Such patients with acute onset of nephrotic syndrome and diffuse foot process fusion on renal biopsy are treated as if they have minimal change disease. (See <a href=\"#H83037486\" class=\"local\">'Acute onset of nephrotic syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no specific serologic markers to identify continued immunologic activity in IgA nephropathy. As a result, clinical parameters are typically used, whether or not the patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. The major parameters that are serially monitored are the serum creatinine concentration or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and protein excretion.
