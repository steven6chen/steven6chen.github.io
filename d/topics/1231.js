Novel immunosuppressive therapies create a diverse set of immune deficits that create the substrate for opportunistic infections. These patients are defined by their susceptibility to infection with organisms of low native virulence for immunologically normal hosts. Survival has improved with the availability of newer antimicrobial agents but is threatened by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>Pulmonary infection remains the most common form of tissue-invasive infection in these hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. In particular, the incidence of pulmonary fungal infection is increasing in immunocompromised individuals despite advances in antifungal prophylaxis and therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates will be reviewed here.

The general rule is to be aggressive in pursuing a specific microbiologic diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates to enable early therapy while avoiding overly broad antimicrobial therapy. A specific diagnosis avoids the potential toxicities of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapies, most notably nephrotoxicity, drug interactions, and <em>Clostridium difficile</em> colitis. Invasive diagnostic techniques are often required.</p><p>A number of general principles are useful for the evaluation of immunocompromised patients presenting with fever and pulmonary infiltrates.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most immunocompromised patients with any sign of possible invasive infection should be hospitalized for evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Awareness of the epidemiology of infection in the community (eg, respiratory viruses, tuberculosis) and the individual (eg, travel history, sexual history, occupational exposures) often provide helpful clues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple simultaneous pulmonary processes are common. These include infectious (eg, viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic) and noninfectious (eg, pulmonary edema, malignancy) etiologies. Routine chest radiography and sputum sampling may fail to detect these concomitant diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing is generally not useful in the acute management of immunocompromised patients. These patients often fail to generate an adequate antibody response to infection. Microbiologic testing should include antigen detection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nucleic acid detection-based assays as well as cultures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence or absence of pulmonary infiltrates should be defined by chest imaging. A chest radiograph is not sufficient to exclude pulmonary involvement if there are any respiratory symptoms or historical features that suggest a possible pulmonary process. Thus, minor abnormalities on a chest radiograph in the immunocompromised host merit further evaluation, generally including computed tomography scanning. Comparison with old imaging studies is essential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some patients, radiographic evidence of pneumonitis may appear only with immune reconstitution, notably engraftment after neutropenia. In such patients, there are few data to guide decisions regarding empiric antimicrobial therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After obtaining microbiologic samples, empiric antimicrobial therapy is initiated and is continued until specific microbiologic data are available to guide therapy. Specific guidelines such as those for fever and neutropenia must be modified based on physical and radiologic findings and past medical history, including exposures, previous infections, and prior antimicrobial therapies. Empiric therapy must be initiated for individuals who are clinical unstable, notably for those with hypotension, hypoxemia or progressive pulmonary processes, altered mental status or meningitis, evolving skin lesions, bleeding diathesis, or severe hyperglycemia.

The epidemiology and risk for pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts have shifted with the increased intensities of chemotherapeutic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppressive regimens and with patterns of antimicrobial use. Routine prophylaxis has increased the risk for unusual pathogens that are resistant to prophylactic agents including fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococci, multidrug-resistant bacteria, azole-resistant molds, and ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. As a result, empiric therapies for infection require use of agents not used for prophylaxis in the recent past and review of prior microbiology data from individual patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutropenia is the most common risk factor for pulmonary infection in immunocompromised patients. Whether due to underlying malignancy, chemotherapy, or the side effects of other drugs, the depth and duration of neutropenia are correlated with the risk for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Rates of infection vary depending upon the host. Nosocomial infections in neutropenic cancer patients occur at a rate of 46.3 episodes per 1000 neutropenic days (48.3 episodes per 100 neutropenic patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The rate of infection was similar in another study that included patients with acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or after conditioning for hematopoietic cell transplantation (37.7 episodes per 1000 neutropenic days), although over 64 percent of patients had febrile episodes while neutropenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Rates of infection in solid tumor patients and solid organ transplant recipients are somewhat less.</p><p>The originating site of infection frequently cannot be identified in febrile cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. When identified, common sources of infection in the febrile neutropenic patient are colonizing organisms from the upper and lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract (including the perineal and perirectal areas), the urinary tract, and the skin (including intravenous lines and wounds). Pulmonary infections are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in febrile neutropenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Many infections are detected only at autopsy, particularly disseminated fungal or combined fungal and bacterial infections.</p><p>Mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients (eg, umbilical cord blood or matched unrelated donor transplants) being treated for hematologic malignancies require intensive induction chemotherapy, which may result in prolonged neutropenia. Such patients also require immunosuppression to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These patients are therefore at particularly high risk of infection, often with organisms resistant to prophylactic agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354232681\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids have an important role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia due to depression of phagocytic function of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, decreased mobilization of inflammatory cells into areas of infection, and alterations in antigen presentation and lymphocyte mobilization. These effects increase the risk of bacterial and fungal infections (including those due to <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>, <em>Nocardia </em>spp, and <em>Aspergillus </em>spp) and the risk for pulmonary involvement in the setting of certain herpes virus infections (eg, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354232690\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and blockade of other mediators of inflammation (cytokines and chemokines) predispose to infection with intracellular pathogens (mycobacteria, Legionella species) as well as systemic viral and fungal infections, including those caused by molds (<em>Aspergillus</em> spp), yeasts (<em>Cryptococcus </em>spp), dimorphic fungi (<em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Coccidioides </em>spp), and <em>P. jirovecii</em>.

B lymphocyte depletion is used in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies and for antibody-mediated graft rejection and may predispose to infection due to encapsulated bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The agents used to suppress T lymphocyte function include the calcineurin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>) used in organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation. These predispose to herpesvirus infections (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and varicella-zoster) and community-acquired respiratory viruses, fungal infections (including <em>Cryptococcus</em>, <em>Pneumocystis</em>, and <em>Aspergillus</em> spp), and parasites (eg, <em>Strongyloides</em>, <em>Toxoplasma,</em> and <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fludarabine</a> produces a prolonged deficit in T cell functions. Malignancies related to viral activation (eg, Epstein Barr virus&ndash;associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, skin cancers) are common complications of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with autoimmune diseases, antibody deficiencies (eg, glomerulonephritis with proteinuria or Goodpasture's syndrome), and some hematologic malignancies are susceptible to bacterial infections (ie, bacteremia) and to a lesser extent to opportunistic infections similar to those of cancer and transplant patients. Bacterial infections may be related to deficiencies in opsonization and phagocytosis. Dual infections (respiratory virus followed by bacterial or fungal infections) are common. The severity and nature of these infections depend on the type, duration, and intensity of immunosuppressive therapy. The spectrum of opportunistic infections seen in this patient population is widening as the number and variety of immunosuppressive agents used to treat autoimmune diseases has increased, ranging from calcineurin inhibitors, anti-TNF alpha agents, costimulatory blockade, and other biologic agents.

Lymphadenopathy may be observed with acute viral infections (CMV, EBV), sarcoidosis, and infections due to mycobacteria, <em>Cryptococcus</em> spp, and with drug reactions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>). Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) may differentiate infection from tumor.</p><p/><p>CT scans will frequently detect multiple patterns simultaneously, in contrast with conventional radiographs, which can raise the possibility of dual or sequential infection of the lungs. In a patient being treated for PCP, for example, the appearance of acinar, macronodular, or cavitary lesions is highly suggestive of a complicating infection, often secondary <em>Aspergillus</em> invasion of lung tissue compromised by the primary process.</p><p>Another important use of the CT scan is to identify the site for optimal sampling and assist in defining the most appropriate invasive procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

CT can also help to predict whether bronchoscopy is likely to be useful. As an example, the demonstration of a feeding bronchus that communicates with a pulmonary nodule greatly increases the diagnostic yield when bronchoscopy is performed (60 versus 30 percent when the feeding bronchus is not visible).

These other sites may be more accessible than the lungs for establishing a microbiologic diagnosis. Thus, skin lesions or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may demonstrate <em>Cryptococcus </em>spp or mycobacterial infection before the microbiologic results from sputum or lung biopsy specimens are available. (See <a href=\"#H1420650\" class=\"local\">'Site of entry'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1420242\"><span class=\"h3\">Lung sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An invasive diagnostic procedure such as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transbronchial biopsy, percutaneous needle biopsy, video-assisted thorascopic biopsy (VATS), or open lung biopsy is frequently required to obtain a sample of sputum or lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/52-56,58-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56,58-65</a>]. The selection of the optimal procedure is determined both by the nature (ie, focal or diffuse) and location of the pulmonary lesion and the skills available locally. Diffuse lesions may be sampled by transbronchial biopsy, whereas nodules are better located by CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy, VATS, or open lung biopsy. VATS is also very useful for sampling of peripheral pulmonary lesions. The sensitivity of BAL is improved early (days 1 to 2) over later sampling and is reduced by antimicrobial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/58,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,65</a>]. The yield of invasive procedures varies between 25 and approximately 60 percent depending on the patient population studied. In 199 patients with hematologic malignancy and fever, BAL was performed 246 times and produced a microbiologic diagnoses in 118 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>It is reasonable to obtain an induced sputum for certain studies (eg, acid-fast bacilli, <em>Pneumocystis</em>, cytology, and routine stains and cultures) while awaiting more invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Positive results may allow for more invasive procedures to be avoided. The yield of induced sputum samples is higher than routine sputum samples only for mycobacteria, PCP, and cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic yield of BAL is greatest in untreated HIV-infected patients due to the large numbers of organisms (eg, <em>P. jirovecii</em>, mycobacteria) compared with other compromised individuals. Conversely, transbronchial biopsy may be considered with BAL in HIV-uninfected immunocompromised hosts without specific contraindications to avoid the need for multiple sequential procedures. In particular, BAL alone is less often useful for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection than for PCP or bacterial processes. Further, biopsy allows distinction between colonization and invasion of fungal (or viral) infection and may detect underlying processes such as bronchiolitis obliterans and drug-induced lung injury. Bronchial brushings do not generally add much information in immunocompromised patients. BAL fluid may be tested for <em>Aspergillus</em> galactomannan antigen, potentially aiding in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p>In patients in whom transbronchial biopsy is not feasible, VATS or open lung biopsy will often provide the best means for establishing a diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/65,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,70</a>]. One study from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center evaluated the results of lung biopsy (either via thoracotomy or VATS) in 63 patients with hematologic malignancies: 40 percent of patients had active malignancy at the time of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Only 6 percent of patients were neutropenic at the time of the biopsy. Open lung biopsy resulted in a specific diagnosis in 62 percent of these cases and in a change of therapy in 57 percent. Patients with focal abnormalities by chest radiography were more likely than those with diffuse findings to obtain a specific diagnosis following biopsy (79 versus 32 percent). Forty-six percent of patients who underwent bronchoscopy with BAL, 50 percent of the eight patients who underwent transbronchial biopsy, and 50 percent of patients who underwent needle aspiration had specific diagnoses made after lung biopsy. The procedure resulted in complications in 13 percent of cases, including two with major complications. However, the mortality was improved at 30 and 90 days post-procedure for those in whom a specific diagnosis was made compared with those without a specific diagnosis, especially in patients who had undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation (8 versus 62 percent 90 day-mortality).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiologic assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine sputum samples should be collected for cultures and staining whenever possible.

Examples include CMV viral loads (nucleic acid testing [NAT]) or antigenemia, serum cryptococcal antigen (with any signs of meningitis), syphilis serology, human herpesvirus 6 NAT, <em>Aspergillus galactomannan</em> antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen, and 1,3-beta-D-glucan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New molecular diagnostic techniques may be applicable to BAL fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p/><p>In the case of CMV or <em>Aspergillus</em> infection, the finding of the agent or antigens in the lungs may be the basis of therapy in immunocompromised patients with consistent clinical syndromes and radiologic findings (&quot;probable disease&quot;). Such evidence is useful as a basis for empiric therapy but are confounded by colonization. Some of these assays are more useful for screening of asymptomatic patients than for diagnosis; the sensitivity and specificity of each assay should be ascertained. As an example, the presence of CMV viremia indicates CMV reactivation but may not provide information about the presence of invasive disease. Conversely, the absence of CMV viremia may mitigate against the diagnosis of invasive CMV pneumonitis.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Novel immunosuppressive therapies create a diverse set of immune deficits that create the substrate for opportunistic infections. These patients are defined by their susceptibility to infection with organisms of low native virulence for immunologically normal hosts. Pulmonary infection remains the most common form of tissue-invasive infection in these hosts. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early diagnosis and specific therapy of opportunistic infections is the cornerstone of successful treatment. The general rule is to be aggressive in pursuing a specific microbiologic diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates to avoid overly broad antimicrobial therapy; invasive diagnostic techniques are often required.

These patients are generally considered to be at higher risk and are best managed as inpatients until clinically stable. Patients with a history of frank rigors or hypotension also should be admitted. A very low threshold should also exist for admission and treatment of splenectomized patients with fever.

The pattern of involvement can be helpful in establishing the etiology of the process. A chest radiograph is not sufficient to exclude pulmonary involvement if there are any respiratory symptoms or historical features that suggest a possible pulmonary process. The threshold for performing a chest CT should be very low in immunocompromised hosts.
