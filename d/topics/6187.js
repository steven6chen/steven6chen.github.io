When fully expressed, the manifestations include ovulatory dysfunction, androgen excess, and polycystic ovaries. It is recognized as one of the most common <span class=\"nowrap\">endocrine/metabolic</span> disorders of women. This syndrome was first described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although the presence of sclerocystic ovaries had been recognized for at least 90 years prior to their report.</p><p>The definition, epidemiology, and pathogenesis (including genetics) of PCOS will be reviewed here.

Of note, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Evidence-based Methodology Workshop Panel on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in 2012 suggested the following recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: (1) renaming the disorder to more adequately reflect the complex metabolic, hypothalamic, pituitary, ovarian, and adrenal interactions that characterize the syndrome (and their reproductive implications, although no specific name was recommended); and (2) maintaining the broad, inclusionary diagnostic criteria of Rotterdam (which includes the &quot;classic NIH&quot; and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society criteria), while specifically identifying each of the subphenotypes in research and clinical initiatives.

Others subsequently observed excess luteinizing hormone (LH) activity in the urine of women with the Stein-Leventhal syndrome, determined using a bioassay (ie, the ovarian response of immature female rats or the prostatic response of hypophysectomized male rats to urinary extracts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. This was later confirmed by plasma levels determined by radioimmunoassay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Prior to the description of polycystic ovaries by Stein and Leventhal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the presence of sclerocystic ovaries was felt to be due to a number of disparate etiologies. In 1910, Fogue and Massabuau described three potential mechanisms: inflammation, congestion, and dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The inflammation theory proposed that the microcystic ovary was the result of infection either of internal or external provenance. The congestion theory suggested that the lesion was the result of pressure, partial torsion, or other interruption in circulatory flow to the ovary. Finally, the dystrophy theory proposed that the abnormalities were caused by modifications or abnormalities in the nutrition of the ovary.</p><p>Others suggested that the development of polycystic ovaries was due to the morphological changes observed in the ovaries, including a thickened tunica albuginea that impeded normal ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]; however, these anatomic changes appear to primarily reflect the endocrine milieu, and effective ovulation is achievable by modulating the endocrine environment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a>, gonadotropins, or insulin sensitizers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction#H523298549\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;, section on 'Oral agents'</a>.)</p><p>Some investigators proposed an adrenal etiology for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) based upon observations in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia or adrenal neoplasms (both of whom often present with irregular menses and hyperandrogenism), and the response of the patients to cortisone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

The inherited basis of PCOS was established by twin studies and reports demonstrating an increased prevalence of PCOS in female first-degree relatives of affected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/26,27,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,49</a>].</p><p>The largest twin study documented monozygotic correlation of 71 percent and a dizygotic correlation of 38 percent; the study authors estimated that genetic influences account for as much as 70 percent of the variance in the pathogenesis of PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The prevalence of PCOS in mothers and sisters of PCOS women is 20 to 40 percent, considerably higher than that seen in the general population, strongly supporting a genetic basis of PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The principal genetic targets for the variants that have been identified include genes regulating gonadotropin secretion and action, ovarian folliculogenesis, insulin secretion and action, weight and energy regulation, and androgen biosynthesis and action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64337 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Many candidate genes have demonstrated some evidence of linkage or association with PCOS, but follow-up studies have often failed to replicate results on the same candidate gene in different populations.

In the first genome-wide association and replication studies of PCOS, conducted in Chinese Han individuals, three loci were identified that were significantly associated with PCOS: two loci on chromosome 2 and a third locus on chromosome 9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. One of these loci, on chromosome 2p16.3, contains the gene for the <span class=\"nowrap\">LH/hCG</span> receptor (<em>LHCGR</em>), a logical susceptibility gene for PCOS. Two of the three, 2p21 and 9p33.3, contained multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appeared to be independently associated with PCOS. The chromosome 2p21 locus contained SNPs in <em>THADA</em>, a gene that codes for a thyroid adenoma-associated protein. A report in patients with type 2 diabetes suggested that the <em>THADA</em> gene variant is associated with impaired beta cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>A subsequent GWAS observed that several of the same variants in <em>DENND1A</em> and <em>THADA</em> associated with PCOS in the Chinese population also affected the odds of PCOS in individuals of European origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Six independent signals reached genome-wide significance for association with PCOS. Four were novel signals in or near the genes <em>ERBB4</em>, <em>FSHB</em>, <em>RAD50,</em> and <em>KRR1</em>.

In a 2004 study from the United States, 60 percent of women with PCOS were obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>], approximately twice the rate seen in the general adult population at that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

Likewise, while the prevalence of obesity in the population varies widely throughout the world, the prevalence of PCOS appears to be relatively uniform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/6-8,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,92</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 675 unselected women seeking an employment history; the prevalence rates of PCOS in underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese women were 8.2, 9.8, 9.9, and 9.0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3385590248\"><span class=\"h4\">Rates of obesity and referral bias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Current data suggest that obesity is not as frequent in PCOS as previously thought, and it appears that the high rate of obesity reported in the disorder may, to a large extent, reflect referral bias in the populations studied. In a study of 292 PCOS patients identified at a tertiary care outpatient facility (referral PCOS) and 64 unselected PCOS subjects identified through the screening of a population of 668 women seeking a pre-employment physical, the referral PCOS subjects had higher mean BMI, hirsutism scores, and degrees of hyperandrogenemia, and they were more likely to be non-Hispanic white (84 percent) and have a more severe PCOS subphenotype than the unselected PCOS or unselected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of obesity and severe obesity in referral PCOS women was 2.3 and 2.5 times greater than estimates of the same in unselected PCOS and 2.2 and 3.8 times greater than estimates in unselected controls, respectively. Alternatively, unselected PCOS subjects had a prevalence of obesity and severe obesity and a mean BMI similar to those of the general population from which they were derived. A meta-analysis also confirmed that the BMI of PCOS patients seen in referral populations is significantly higher than for PCOS patients identified in unselected populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. This referral bias is not entirely surprising, since obesity is a significant detractor from quality of life and likely drives patient self-referral for medical care. Overall, these newer data suggest that while women with PCOS may appear to be more obese than their peers, much, if not all, of this increased prevalence may be the result of referral bias.</p><p>Although excess adiposity may not be a principal driver of the high prevalence of PCOS, the mean BMI of women with PCOS seen in the clinic has been gradually increasing over time; the change parallels the increase in BMI seen in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The prevalence of PCOS is increased in the presence of obesity; insulin resistance; type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes mellitus; oligoovulatory infertility; premature adrenarche; a positive family history for PCOS among first-degree relatives; and possibly, in certain ethnic groups. Regardless of the definition used, clinical and research reports should clearly describe the type of PCOS phenotypes being included (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F115329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115329 \">table 1</a>).

Further studies of well-defined patients, preferably selected from medically unbiased populations, are necessary to develop an understanding of the etiology(s) of this highly prevalent and morbid disorder.
