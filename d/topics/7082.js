It is designed to protect against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and is available without prescription. No contraindications exist to its use, but it may not be appropriate for women who are not comfortable touching their genitals or who may have other problems with insertion. Female condoms account for less than 1 percent of condoms produced globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) published <a href=\"http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/family_planning/female_condom_specification.pdf&amp;token=zK0GRzvVv6gwKHhH5BERtavKzXW3iAPPQdOL1UwgGdJDfkxPuMFcTcmu9S5N49BFT2Ni9DL2oKK+utXVTzoGUVov0PShXWUhQt2bNM9aSCYhAGTbn6aa+WKQWFhnTxSc&amp;TOPIC_ID=5471\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WHO/UNFPA Female Condom: Generic Specification, Prequalification and Guidelines for Procurement</a> to provide a technically sound, systematic process to support the manufacture, prequalification, procurement and distribution of quality female condoms that meet the needs of different populations in a broad spectrum of challenging environmental conditions. In 2015 the US Food and Drug Administration announced it was considering reclassification of the female condom from a Class III to a Class II device. This change would reduce regulatory control to the level assigned to male condoms, potentially expanding innovation opportunity for female condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF FEMALE CONDOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All female condoms currently available or in development have an anchor (eg, ring, frame) outside the vagina to prevent the condom from being pushed inside the vagina during use; the anchor is also used for removing the condom. Female condoms have been made out of natural rubber latex, synthetic latex (nitrile), and polyurethane. They prevent preejaculatory fluid, semen, and vaginal secretions from entering the users&rsquo; vagina. No spermicide is required, but a lubricant is often needed. An illustration can be seen at the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/17063.htm&amp;token=HelhfZzi93KrxesxRAWl9uov+Rfl3VTCkW8Vbf4SQcnNkiyW0jvseJ5nmDsaetY4nrjWeL5mF+9OXSrih/yC93EweIiQ1gEQluy7sXAEOdE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5471\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">US National Library of Medicine</a>. </p><p>The most widely available female condom today is FC2, manufactured by the Female Health Company (Chicago, Illinois). It is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile sheath or pouch with two flexible rings. One ring is contained within the closed end of the sheath and serves as an insertion mechanism and internal anchor. The other ring forms the external, open edge of the device; it remains outside the vagina after insertion. Silicone-based lubricant lines the inside of the condom, but additional lubrication for the inside <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> outside could be used. The condom is about 17 cm (6.5 inches) in length (similar to a male condom). </p><p>In 2009, FC2 replaced the FC1, the first condom marketed to women also manufactured by the Female Health Company. FC2 is similar in design to FC1, but made of nitrile (rather than polyurethane) and without a seam. In comparative trials, it performed as well as the FC1 in terms of patient satisfaction, breakage, slippage, and invagination (ie, when the outer frame of the condom pushes into the vagina during intercourse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. No data on pregnancy prevention or STI prevention are available for FC2 specifically, but effectiveness is assumed to be similar to the FC1 given the similar design, specifications, and functionality. The FC2 is indicated for preventing pregnancy, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS,</span> and other sexually transmitted infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It may make less noise during intercourse than the FC1 and is projected to be cheaper when mass produced. It is available in about 100 countries. It has been approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); has CE Marking, which certifies that the device meets consumer safety standards and can be marketed in countries in the European Union; and has been cleared by the World Health Organization (WHO) for purchase by United Nations agencies.</p><p>Variations to the <span class=\"nowrap\">FC1/FC2</span> have been developed. One randomized, crossover trial examining condom failure events (eg, breakage, slippage, and invagination) showed non-inferiority for the following three devices versus the FC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural Latex Female Condom (Cupid) &ndash; The Natural Latex Female Condom, manufactured by Cupid Limited, Mumbai, India, is the second female condom that has received WHO approval. It is distributed in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Netherlands, South Africa, and Mozambique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PATH WC &ndash; The Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) Woman's Condom (WC) is another recently developed female condom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is made of polyurethane and inserted using an insertion capsule, which dissolves after insertion and releases the condom. Hydrophilic areas on the condom allow it to cling lightly to the vaginal wall and keep it in place. It is not prelubricated, but is sold with a water-based lubricant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The WC was granted CE Marking in 2010 and the South African Bureau of Standards certification mark in 2013. To support market registration in China, a single-arm couples&rsquo; use study was conducted to assess WC performance and safety. The study showed levels of functionality consistent with condom performance data from other female condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In 2016, the product was cleared by the World Health Organization for purchase by United Nations agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VA w.o.w &ndash; The VA w.o.w (worn of women) (also known by the brand names Condom Feminine, L'amour female condom, Reddy FC) is made of natural rubber latex and is available in some parts of Europe, Asia, and Latin America. It has been granted CE Marking and India Drug Control Authority approval. The condom has a medical grade sponge at one end that is used for insertion; the other end has a triangular frame to anchor it outside the vagina. It is prelubricated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Other female condoms with less availability include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phoenurse and Natural Sensation Panty Condom &ndash; The polyurethane Phoenurse is manufactured and distributed in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A randomized crossover trial conducted in China showed that breakage, slippage, and incorrect penetration of the penis were significantly more common with the Phoenurse than with the FC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The Natural Sensation Panty Condom, manufactured in Colombia, is available in parts of Europe and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No published randomized trials have compared the clinical effectiveness of male and female condoms for prevention of either pregnancy or STIs (including HIV). However, two randomized crossover trials in the United States and Brazil used the proxy measures of breakage, slippage, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as indicators of semen exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Participants used both condom types, completed condom-specific questionnaires to report problems, and collected precoital and postcoital samples of vaginal fluid for PSA. Although PSA detection rates were similar for both female and male condoms, users in both trials reported female condoms were associated with significantly more mechanical problems (eg, slippage, breakage, incorrect penetration) than male condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Regardless of the type of female condom, use difficulties like slippage and invagination decrease with experience, markedly after as few as five uses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most rigorous data regarding contraceptive effectiveness of female condoms were derived from a cohort study of 221 couples using the FC1 (Reality) female condom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The estimated rates of pregnancy during the first 12 months of perfect use and typical use were 5 and 21 percent, respectively; these pregnancy rates are higher than those associated with use of the male condom (perfect and typical use pregnancy rates of 2 and 18 percent, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]).

Two of three randomized trials of behavioral interventions to promote use of the female condom observed that groups assigned to use FC1 had lower STI rates than groups assigned to use male condoms, but the differences were not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In the third trial, the STI rate in the group who only had access to male condoms was the same as that for the group with access to both male and female condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-condoms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].
