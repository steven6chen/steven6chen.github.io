In such high risk individuals, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is recommended for as long as the NSAID is used. In one trial of patients with bleeding ulcers who tested positive for <em>H. pylori</em> and had to remain on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, maintenance therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> was more effective in preventing recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding than anti-<em>H. pylori</em> therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In clinical practice, however, ulcer patients who are <em>H. pylori</em> positive are generally treated with a PPI along with <em>H. pylori</em> eradication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management#H527229648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Eradication of Helicobacter pylori'</a>.)</p><p>When first introduced, COX-2 inhibitors held promise as an alternative to traditional NSAIDs in preventing recurrent peptic ulcer disease in individuals who required ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;, section on 'Selective COX-2 inhibitors'</a>.) Simply substituting a COX-2 inhibitor for the prior nonselective NSAID in patients with NSAID-related ulcer disease and ulcer complications should not be chosen over PPI maintenance therapy. This was demonstrated in a trial of 273 arthritis patients with NSAID-related bleeding ulcers. Once the ulcers had healed, the authors found that substituting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> 200 mg bid plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> (20 mg bid) for a year was significantly more effective in preventing recurrent bleeding ulcers than simply substituting celecoxib (plus placebo bid) for the NSAID that the patient had been taking previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, patients treated with low-dose aspirin have an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which must be weighed against a possible decrease in cardiovascular mortality. The risk of recurrent bleeding in aspirin users may be higher in patients without a past or current <em>H. pylori</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Different approaches using a PPI to prevent recurrent GI bleeding in patients who continue low-dose aspirin therapy have been evaluated in several randomized trials performed in East Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/2,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-11</a>].</p><p>Placebo-controlled trials showed a significant reduction in recurrent ulcer complications with PPI therapy among low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> users. The trials can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients infected with <em>H. pylori</em>, the rate of recurrent ulcer complications was significantly lower at one year with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> (30 mg daily) compared to placebo (1.6 versus 14.8 percent). Lansoprazole or placebo was started after the ulcer had healed and <em>H. pylori</em> had been eradicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar difference in recurrent bleeding at one year (0.7 versus 8.6 percent) in <em>H. pylori</em> negative patients was noted with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> (20 mg twice daily) plus low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (80 mg daily) compared to an esomeprazole placebo twice daily plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A similar trial was stopped early because of a higher bleeding rate in the clopidogrel group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other trials in low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> users compared different therapies without a placebo group. In one, a PPI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a>) was associated with a significantly lower rate of recurrent symptomatic or bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">ulcers/erosions</span> than an H2-blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a>) (0 versus 20 percent at 48 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a second trial, limited to patients who were <em>H. pylori</em> positive, there was no significant difference in recurrent bleeding at six months with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> compared to anti-<em>H. pylori</em> therapy (0.9 versus 1.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a third trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a> (5 or 10 mg per day) markedly reduced the incidence of recurrent ulcers over 24 weeks compared to the comparator therapy, teprenone (a mucosal protective agent), with no bleeding ulcers occurring in the rabeprazole groups but in nearly 5 percent of the teprenone group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>In summary, patients who require low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for cardiovascular prophylaxis and have had a bleeding ulcer while taking low-dose aspirin should be treated with a PPI (rather than an H2-blocker), along with <em>H. pylori</em> eradication if they test positive for <em>H. pylori</em>.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.) Patients with a history of a complicated, NSAID-related peptic ulcer (especially if recent) who must resume an NSAID in addition to low-dose aspirin are at very high GI risk. A major controlled clinical trial was performed in Hong Kong in patients with bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers related to NSAID and aspirin use. Once the ulcer had healed, patients were placed on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> (COX-2 selective) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (COX nonselective) plus esomeprazole; both groups were encouraged to continue taking their low-dose aspirin. Although recurrent ulcer bleeding over the ensuing 18 months was common in both groups, it was significantly less common in the celecoxib group than in the naproxen group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>In another major clinical trial, 24,081 patients whose arthritis pain could not be controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> were randomly assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>. Nearly half of them were also receiving low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for cardiovascular prophylaxis. All patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> co-therapy. Patients at very high GI risk due to recent ulcer complications or uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease were excluded, although some patients with a more remote history of ulcer disease may have been included. Thus, this study mainly compared celecoxib plus PPI with a nonselective NSAID plus PPI for primary prevention of GI toxicity, but in some patients, the study likely constituted a secondary prevention trial. Clinically significant GI events were uncommon during a median follow-up period of 34 months and were similar in the groups (celecoxib 0.7 percent, naproxen 0.7 percent, and ibuprofen 0.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In summary, if an NSAID and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> must be resumed in high GI risk patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> plus a PPI may be preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> plus a PPI. However, in patients at lower GI risk, celecoxib plus a PPI may not have an advantage over nonselective NSAIDs plus a PPI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of stopping low-dose aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benefits and risks of stopping low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> were addressed in a randomized trial of 156 adults with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease who were being treated with low-dose aspirin and developed peptic ulcer bleeding. After control of bleeding with endoscopic therapy and use of a PPI, patients were assigned to continue taking aspirin (80 mg per day) or to stop the aspirin and switch to a placebo for eight weeks. Stopping aspirin therapy was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in the primary endpoint of recurrent ulcer bleeding within 30 days (5.4 percent versus 10.3 percent with continued aspirin therapy). Stopping aspirin was also associated with a significant increase in the secondary endpoint of overall mortality at eight weeks (12.3 versus 1.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Because the magnitude of this mortality difference was much greater than seen in previous large randomized trials of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with much longer follow-up, the authors appropriately concluded that larger trials are needed to confirm their findings.
