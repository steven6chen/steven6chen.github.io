Periprocedural myocardial necrosis, which can range from a low-level elevation of cardiac biomarkers to a large MI, is the most common complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With advances in technology, particularly the use of coronary stents, the incidence of early, major cardiac events of death and large MI (both non-ST and ST elevation MI) have fallen to less than 3 percent, even in complex multivessel PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

In the American College of Cardiology-National (United States) Cardiovascular Data Registry, there were over 200,000 patients without an acute coronary syndrome or elevated baseline biomarkers who underwent PCI between January 2004 and March 2007. Of these, 8 percent had a peak CK-MB &gt;3 X ULN.</p><p>An elevation of cardiac troponin above the upper limits of normal following PCI has been noted in as many as 50 percent of patients undergoing PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/3,5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,13,14</a>]. Cardiac troponins are a more sensitive marker than CK-MB for minor degrees of myocardial damage and elevated values after PCI with or without stenting are more common than increases in serum CK-MB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In an analysis from the Mayo Clinic PCI registry, approximately 20 percent of patients with normal pre-procedural CK-MB and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) values had an isolated post-procedural elevation in serum cTnT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may lead to myocardial injury with cell necrosis due to periprocedural events such as coronary dissection, occlusion of a major coronary artery or a side-branch, disruption of collateral flow, slow flow or no-reflow, distal embolization, and microvascular plugging. In patients with PCI related myocardial injury, cardiac troponin (cTn) values will rise. The more sensitive the cTn test used, the higher the percentage of patients who will have detectable myocardial injury. The level of myocardial injury (cTn value) that should qualify as a periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) has been debated for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/18-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-27</a>]. Two issues have caused significant discussion: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of cTn above which an MI would be said to have occurred (in patients with normal baseline values). The tension in this area is attributable in large part to the fact that a definition that allows for a high degree of sensitivity for the diagnosis of myocardial necrosis will likely have a low specificity for events that are clinically meaningful; the converse is also true. Unlike a type I MI (acute coronary syndrome), many experts have recommended that a diagnosis of a periprocedural MI be made only if the level of the biomarker is associated with a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Their concern is that small increases from baseline in biomarker levels after PCI are expected (microembolization is an example) and do not necessarily represent a complication or a condition for which management needs to change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The difficulty in interpreting post-procedure elevations in patients with elevated baseline values of cTn.</p><p/><p>The 2012 Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction formulated by a joint European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/World</span> Health Federation task force arrived at the following definition, which addresses these two (and other) concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]: MI associated with PCI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values &gt;5 x 99<sup>th</sup> percentile upper reference limit (URL) in patients with normal baseline values (&le;99<sup>th</sup> percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values &gt;20 percent if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, or (ii) new ischemic electrocardiographic changes or new left bundle branch block, or (iii) angiographic loss of patency of a major coronary artery or a side branch or persistent slow- or no-flow or embolization, or (iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality are required. The incidence of periprocedural MI using this new definition has not yet been well described.</p><p>The task force also made the following recommendation: When a cTn value is elevated but &le;5 x 99<sup>th</sup> percentile URL after PCI and the cTn value was normal before the PCI, or when the cTn value is &gt;5 x 99<sup>th</sup> percentile URL in the absence of ischemic, angiographic, or imaging findings, the term &ldquo;myocardial injury&rdquo; should be used.</p><p>Other definitions have been proposed, including one by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. For patients undergoing PCI or CABG who have a normal baseline creatinine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB), MI was defined as that resulting in CK-MB &ge;10 x the ULN, or a lower threshold of &ge;5 x the ULN in patients in whom new pathologic Q-waves in &ge;2 contiguous electrocardiograph leads (or new persistent left bundle branch block) develop after PCI. Separate criteria were given for individuals without a normal value for CK-MB at baseline. This issue is in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H609187310\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'SCAI definition'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">New Q waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of new pathological Q waves occurs in approximately 0.5 percent of PCI cases and is usually due to acute stent thrombosis (also called abrupt closure in the absence of a stent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The available evidence, in the aggregate, suggests that biomarker elevation before PCI is the more important determinant of long-term mortality, while both might play a role in in-hospital mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Predictors of mortality and major complications'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence from elevated CK-MB studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although current guidelines recommend troponin as preferred to CK-MB for diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in all instances, including periprocedural, the majority of studies that evaluated the prognosis of periprocedural biomarker elevation have used CK-MB. However, CK-MB is no longer measured routinely after PCI. The following studies illustrate the range of findings. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a post hoc analysis of the 7773 patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes in whom PCI was performed in the ACUITY trial, the one-year outcomes of the 6 percent of patients who developed periprocedural MI were compared to those without periprocedural MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulant-therapy-in-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes#H3076151766\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulant therapy in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;, section on 'UFH compared with bivalirudin'</a>.) Periprocedural MI was defined as a CK-MB &gt;3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) within 24 hours after PCI. After multivariable analysis (adverse baseline and angiographic characteristics, including elevated baseline CK-MB), there was no significant difference in one-year mortality comparing patients to those without periprocedural MI (hazard ratio 1.3, 95% CI 0.85-1.98). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from the EVENT registry of unselected patients undergoing PCI evaluated the relationship between periprocedural MI (defined as a peak CK-MB &gt;3 X ULN) and one-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. After excluding patients with elevated pre-PCI CK-MB and ST-elevation MI, there were 5961 patients. After multivariable adjustment, periprocedural MI was independently associated with one-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.17-2.89). However, in a time-period specific analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio was significantly greater only for 30-day mortality, but not between one month and one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 60 studies have shown that the greater the elevation of CK-MB after the PCI (either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting), the greater the subsequent mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/5,6,13,29-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13,29-36</a>]. While elevations of more than 8- and 10-fold the ULN have been associated with increased death or death and MI, the evidence on the impact of lesser degrees of elevation (&gt;1x to &gt;3x ULN) on mortality is less robust [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/5,13,30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,30-36</a>]. In these studies, the baseline CK-MB was taken into account. However, it appears that the critical level is the pre-PCI cardiac troponin (cTn) value, which, because cTn is so much more sensitive than CK-MB, is often elevated. If cTn is increasing, the CK-MB value will also be increasing, although this increase may be more difficult to appreciate because CK-MB is a less sensitive marker.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 3687 patients with stable disease who underwent stenting, the mortality rates using the Universal Definition did not increase at up to two years with elevation of the CK-MB, including values &gt;10 x ULN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, this study is limited by the lack of use of the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile as the cut-point. </p><p/><p>If one uses the appropriate cut-off value of the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile upper reference limit in the analysis, the prognostic importance of pre-PCI elevations is substantial and renders the post-PCI values of substantially less importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Unfortunately, only one study has used this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In that study, there was marginal significance to the short-term prognosis driven by mostly non-cardiac events. A 2012 report indicates that it may be possible to define criteria for a declining and then rising pattern of CK-MB that identifies peri-PCI myocardial injury associated with adverse events in the long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additional details concerning the metrics of this approach and analysis are needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence from elevated troponin studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results with troponin have been conflicting, with some studies showing long-term prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>] and others not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/17,31,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31,41,42</a>]. We believe the following studies provide the best evidence of the relationship between a periprocedural rise in troponin and subsequent mortality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 15 studies including over 7500 patients with normal baseline troponin levels, troponin elevation occurred in 29 percent of the procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Using the Joint European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/World</span> Health Federation Task Force definition discussed above, PCI-related MI occurred in about half. The following findings were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elevated troponin was associated with a significantly increased risk of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (the composite of all-cause death, MI, repeat target vessel PCI, and coronary artery bypass grafting) (odds ratio [OR] 11.29, 95% CI 3.00-42.48) or death (OR 7.16, 95% CI 1.95-26.27).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Troponin above the cut-off for MI was reported in a subset of patients (n = 2359) from four studies. In an unadjusted analysis, patients with PCI-related MI had a significantly increased risk of death (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.26-4.00) at 26-month follow-up. An increase of the troponin below the cut-off was not associated with major adverse cardiovascular events, but this finding may have been due to a relatively small sample size. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of 2352 patients who underwent PCI assessed the predictive value of baseline and post-procedural troponin (and CK-MB) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Baseline troponin elevations were present in 733 patients (31 percent) and were associated with worse short- and long-term outcomes. When these elevations were taken into account, neither post-procedural troponin nor CK-MB elevations added to the long-term prognostic significance. Post-procedural elevations or increases in the degree of elevation correlated only with in-hospital complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent study from the Mayo Clinic, which evaluated only patients with normal pre-procedural levels of cTnT (and CK-MB), found that the 20 percent of patients with a post-procedural elevation of troponin had a significantly lower estimated three-year survival compared with those with normal troponin (86.9 versus 93.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk of in-hospital death was low irrespective of cTnT status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of nearly 5000 patients undergoing elective coronary stent placement between 2004 and 2007, MI was defined as the peak value between 6 and 24 hours normalized to the local diagnostic level for MI and values greater than three times the ULN were classified as an MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, elevated troponin (and CK-MB) was significantly associated with one-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.35). The mortality hazard for troponin, however, was found only for much higher elevations. Troponin more than 20 times the diagnostic level demonstrated similar mortality risk as CK-MB more than three times the ULN. The mortality association may be overestimated by the absence of baseline troponin elevation as a co-variate in the multivariable analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 2365 patients who underwent elective PCI for stable coronary artery disease assessed the predictive value of baseline and post-procedural troponin (and CK-MB) concentrations and provided a possible explanation for the discrepant findings in previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Baseline troponin elevations had both short- and long-term prognostic significance. When these elevations were taken into account, post-procedural troponin (or CK-MB) elevations did not add to long-term prognostic significance. Post-procedural elevations or increases in the degree of elevation correlated only with in-hospital complications. <br/><br/>This was the first study to use the baseline troponin measurement (as recommended in guidelines) in the analysis along with sensitive contemporary cut-off values, but has been confirmed by a larger analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The marginal significance for in-hospital events was driven by non-cardiac events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 5467 patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes enrolled in three randomized trials, there were 212 who experienced a procedure-related MI after five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There was no difference in the cardiovascular death rate between those who had a procedure-related MI and those who did not (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.47-1.71). This may reflect the fact that as assay sensitivity has increased, the baseline sample, even if the guideline-derived cut-off values are not used, still reduces any effect of post-PCI elevations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 13,608 patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, among the 600 patients who experienced a type 4a (periprocedural) MI in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet agents in acute non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>), 490 had elevated biomarkers before the procedure. Patients with non-ST elevation MI (n = 335 with Type 4 MI) were enrolled and underwent PCI within 72 hours of qualifying symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, whereas patients with ST elevation MI (n = 155 with Type 4 MI) could be enrolled up to two weeks after presentation. Then, if the baseline CK-MB was normal or lower than the original value, a threefold elevation &gt;ULN on two successive measurements or a fivefold elevation on a single sample post-PCI was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death at 180 days (3.2 versus 1.3 percent; adjusted hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.7). The rigorous approach taken in this study to discriminate periprocedural injury that was distinct from the qualifying ischemic syndrome may account for the ability to detect a significant risk relationship in this study. Application and refinement of this strategy in additional populations with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI will be important to understanding whether a similar approach will be valid with troponin-based definitions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 5772 patients with stable or descending cardiac troponin after PCI in two randomized trials among patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, peak cTn and peak CK-MB were associated with one-year mortality. Comparing the adjusted probability of death by one year according to peak cTn and peak CK-MB, the adjusted risk of death was similar for a 60-fold elevation of cTn (4.9 percent) compared with threefold elevation of CK-MB (5.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 5268 patients, both postprocedure cTnT and CK-MB mass levels were associated with three-month mortality.

The duration of hospitalization may be longer based on factors such as the clinical stability, indication for PCI, outcome during the case, biomarker <span class=\"nowrap\">peak/trajectory,</span> and the presence or absence of other acute processes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly associated patient-related risk factors are older age (in most studies &gt;65 years), the extent of coronary disease, the presence of pre-procedural acute coronary syndrome (including unstable angina) and pre-procedural elevation of cardiac markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Other factors include a history of prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, prior myocardial infarction (MI), low ejection fraction, diabetes, and smoking. The presence of a thin fibrous cap or increase lipid core by intravascular imaging are also predictors of a periprocedural MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. A pre-procedural elevation of inflammatory markers such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein is associated with a two- to fourfold increase in periprocedural MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Percutaneous coronary intervention of degenerated saphenous vein grafts, multivessel interventions, and complex lesions, particularly those with evidence of thrombus, are also associated with an increased risk. Other procedural factors associated with post-procedural MI include the number and length of the stents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevations of cardiac enzymes can be due to a number of factors including embolization of atheroma or thrombus, side branch occlusion, no reflow, epicardial or microvascular spasm, or stent thrombosis. With elevations of creatinine kinase MB fraction &gt;5 to 8 x upper limit of normal, distal vessel occlusion from a large embolus, acute stent thrombosis, or major side branch occlusion are usually responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) due to a side branch occlusion is the most common cause (60 percent) and has the lowest associated mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Smaller increases in cardiac biomarkers are likely due to micro-embolization of thrombotic or atherosclerotic material. Evidence for micro-embolization comes from magnetic resonance imaging studies that have shown small, irreversible myocardial injury in patients with elevated cardiac markers following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/51,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54</a>]. Since the size of the infarcts in this setting is small, these minor elevations have been felt to be a marker of more severe coronary atherosclerosis that is responsible for the poor prognosis in these patients. In addition, an enhanced inflammatory state (as evidenced by an elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein) can predispose patients to thrombosis as well as vasospasm, and is felt to play a role as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The mechanism for a periprocedural ST elevation MI (STEMI) is most commonly due to acute stent thrombosis or abrupt closure of the vessel, resulting in complete occlusion of the vessel. Rarely is it due to embolization of large thrombus or atheroma with distal vessel occlusion. Embolization is more common in degenerated saphenous vein graft interventions than in native vessel interventions.</p><p>Distal embolization can contribute to the &quot;no-reflow&quot; phenomenon after PCI. No-reflow is thought to reflect microvascular dysfunction since there is evidence of myocardial ischemia and reduced antegrade coronary flow in the absence of epicardial stenosis or loss of a distal branch. In a report of patients undergoing PCI for a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, those with a post-procedural troponin I elevation were significantly more likely to have reduced tissue-level perfusion than those without a troponin I elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
