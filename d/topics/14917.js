MPGN resulting from complement dysregulation is called C3 glomerulopathy.</p><p>Patients with C3 glomerulopathy commonly progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require renal replacement therapy, including dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transplantation.

Immune complex-mediated MPGN is characterized by both immunoglobulin and complement protein deposition in the kidney, as identified by immunofluorescence microscopy. C3 glomerulopathy is characterized by complement deposition in the absence of immunoglobulin deposition.</p><p>C3 glomerulopathy includes two subtypes that are defined by structural characteristics observed on electron microscopy (EM); these are called dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both subtypes are caused by excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway. Excessive complement pathway activation results from the abnormal generation of a C3 convertase stabilizing autoantibody called C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF), from loss of function of one of the complement regulatory proteins (factor H or factor I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>], or from gain-of-function mutations in C3 that result in resistance to regulation by factor H.

The recurrence rate of dense deposit disease (DDD) is much higher and approaches approximately 80 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Recurrence after transplantation occurs earlier and is more aggressive if associated with monoclonal gammopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence include low complement levels and living-related kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553012018\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with recurrent C3 glomerulopathy typically present within one to two years following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The clinical manifestations are the same among patients with dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and include some or all of the following: proteinuria, hematuria, increased creatinine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypocomplementemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The degree of proteinuria is variable. In one study of 14 patients with recurrent C3GN, protein excretion ranged from 22 to 4288 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Six patients in this series had hematuria, and, among 11 patients with available data, 5 had low serum C3 levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H209916435\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of recurrent C3 glomerulopathy is strongly suspected when patients with known dense deposit disease (DDD) or C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) in the native kidney present with proteinuria, hematuria, or a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The diagnosis is made by kidney biopsy. A biopsy with analysis of tissue by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy should be performed in all transplant recipients who have either DDD or C3GN as a cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the native kidney and who present with unexplained new or worsening proteinuria, hematuria, or a decline in eGFR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-classification-and-causes-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, classification, and causes of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis&quot;, section on 'Pathology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The histologic features that characterize the disease are discussed elsewhere.

Similarly, this should be performed among patients who have a histologic diagnosis of recurrent C3 glomerulopathy, if this has not been done previously. This evaluation is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;C3 glomerulopathies: Dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis&quot;, section on 'Special diagnostic tests'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients who have a known complement abnormality, an extensive re-evaluation is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H209916441\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At this time, there are no controlled studies on which to base therapeutic recommendations for recurrent C3 glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>We treat patients based upon the severity of the presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild disease</strong> &ndash; If the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is stable and proteinuria is &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> we treat with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). This is based upon the observed benefit of these agents in nontransplant recipients with proteinuric kidney disease; a benefit has not been demonstrated specifically among transplant recipients with C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN). The dose is targeted to a decrease in protein excretion to &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/day</span>. We generally give an ACE inhibitor or ARB, even if the patient does not have hypertension. Among such patients, the dose may be limited by hypotension. For hypertensive patients, we also target a blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/80</span> mmHg.

In one analysis that included 70 patients with C3 glomerulopathy (21 with DDD and 59 with C3GN), 20 progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of these, among six patients with DDD who underwent transplantation, disease recurred in all six patients and contributed to allograft loss in three patients. Among seven patients with C3GN who underwent transplantation, disease recurred in four and contributed to allograft loss in three. Allograft survival was estimated to be 94 percent at 1 year (95% CI 65-99), 69 percent at 5 years (95% CI 41-86), and 28 percent at 10 years (95% CI 6-56). Univariable analysis showed that renal impairment at the time of the first renal biopsy, crescentic glomerulonephritis, and severe arteriolar sclerosis by light microscopy were predictive of ESRD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H209916447\"><span class=\"h1\">DE NOVO DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little is known about de novo C3 glomerulopathy in transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
