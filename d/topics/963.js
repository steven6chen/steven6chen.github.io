An ankle fracture is when a person breaks a bone in the ankle. The ankle bones include two lower leg bones called the tibia and fibula, and one foot bone called the talus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83112\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83112 \">figure 1</a>). There are different kinds of ankle fractures. The type of fracture depends on which bone breaks and how it breaks.</p><p>Ankle fractures are common in both children and adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919806\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an ankle fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of an ankle fracture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising or blistering of the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to walk or put weight on the ankle</p><p/><p>An ankle fracture can also make the ankle look crooked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919821\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for an ankle fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about the injury and symptoms, and do an exam. He or she might also order an X-ray of the ankle. But for some types of ankle injury, X-rays are not needed.</p><p>Some people need other imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919836\"><span class=\"h1\">How are ankle fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of ankle fracture and how severe it is.</p><p>Treatment for a mild ankle fracture usually involves:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting the ankle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising the ankle above the level of the heart, for example, by propping it up on pillows &ndash; This is helpful only for the first few days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on the ankle &ndash; Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and the skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after the injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing a splint, brace, or cast &ndash; With some braces and casts, people are able to put weight on their ankle and walk around. With other braces and casts, people are not allowed to put weight on their ankle or walk around.</p><p/><p>Treatment for an ankle fracture also includes medicine to treat the pain. Doctors can prescribe a strong pain medicine if people have a lot of pain or a severe fracture. For mild fractures, doctors usually recommend that people take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>A severe ankle fracture is treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor will put the ankle bones back in position by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using screws, pins, rods, or plates to fix the bones inside the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting pins or screws through the skin and into the bones, and then attaching the pins or screws to a bar that is outside the skin</p><p/><p>Doctors sometimes recommend that adults work with a physical therapist (exercise expert) after their ankle fracture heals. Physical therapists teach people exercises and stretches to strengthen the muscles, help the joints move more easily, and improve balance. Doctors or physical therapists might also suggest exercises for you to do at home. Children usually heal fully without needing physical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919851\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do ankle fractures take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ankle fractures take weeks to months to heal, depending on the type of fracture.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919866\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It is important to follow all of the doctor's instructions while the fracture is healing. This includes instructions about when to put weight on the ankle.</p><p>Doctors also usually recommend that people with a fracture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid getting their cast or splint wet, if they have a cast or splint that shouldn't get wet.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking. Fractures can take longer to heal if people smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919881\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, the doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You (or your child) get a fever, chest pain, or have trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pus drains out of the cut from the surgery, or the skin around the cut looks redder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain is severe, or the pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The foot or toes get numb, or the toes look blue or purple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The splint is too tight or too loose.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cast gets damaged or wet, and it's not supposed to get wet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919896\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
