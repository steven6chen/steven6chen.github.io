The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is a mixed nerve composed of about 80 percent afferent sensory fibers carrying information to the brain and 20 percent efferent fibers sending signals from the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-surgical-approaches/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The nerve is connected to the nucleus solitarius, which communicates with brain stem nuclei implicated in mood regulation (eg, the locus coeruleus). In addition, neuroimaging data suggest that vagus nerve stimulation can alter activity in several cortical and subcortical brain regions that may be involved in mood regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-surgical-approaches/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671842\"><span class=\"h2\">External sources of patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Educational material explaining vagus nerve stimulation for patients and family members is freely available for printing at the United States <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/&amp;token=JSo2OzASLn/5+FunBFzSQFbOxSBzuePezztrqsxgt8w=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16518\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Institute of Mental Health</a> website.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9580672\"><span class=\"h1\">DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep brain stimulation is an investigational treatment for intractable unipolar major depression, in which one or more electrodes are implanted into targeted brain regions through burr holes or a craniotomy using a stereotactic frame and magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-surgical-approaches/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

A second procedure is performed under general anesthesia to tunnel wires beneath the scalp and skin of the neck to connect the electrodes to a pulse generator that controls stimulation parameters and is implanted subcutaneously in the chest. Stimulation is usually continuous rather than intermittent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-surgical-approaches/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and parameters (eg, voltage, pulse-width, and frequency) are adjusted with a handheld transmitter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-surgical-approaches/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>]. In the United States, deep brain stimulation is available to patients with unipolar major depression only through a research protocol.
