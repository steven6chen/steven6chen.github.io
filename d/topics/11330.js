Teeth can break, fall out, become loose, and cause pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225127\"><span class=\"h1\">How common are mouth and dental injuries in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very common. Close to half of all children hurt their mouths or teeth at some point. In most cases, children get better without problems. But mouth and tooth injuries can be serious.

You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press on the area with a clean cloth or gauze, if there is bleeding. Hold the pressure for 10 minutes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your child pain medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225155\"><span class=\"h1\">What tests should my child have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or dentist will decide which tests your child should have, based on his or her symptoms and individual situation. Often all the doctor or dentist needs to do is examine the child and ask how the injury happened. In some cases, an X-ray or other imaging test might be needed to check for broken bones, tooth damage, or swallowed teeth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225162\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need treatment for a tooth injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on where the injury is, how severe it is, and how old your child is. Your child might not need any treatment. For tooth injuries, treatment depends on whether the injury is in a baby tooth or an adult tooth.</p><p>Adult teeth usually start to come in after age 6 or 7. They look different than baby teeth. If you and your child's doctor are not sure which type of tooth is hurt, an X-ray can help. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225169\"><span class=\"h1\">How are injuries to baby teeth treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the type of injury. The dentist might repair the tooth, remove it, or do nothing. If a baby tooth is removed or falls out, the adult tooth usually grows in just fine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225176\"><span class=\"h1\">How are injuries to adult teeth treated in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the type of injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If one of your child's adult teeth is loose, the dentist might push it back in place. To hold it there while it heals, he or she might use stitches or a splint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If one of your child's adult teeth breaks, the dentist might:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Put broken pieces back on (make sure to save any pieces you find by putting them in tap water)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fix the tooth with a material that looks like teeth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If one of your child's adult teeth falls out, act fast. You should put the tooth back in its socket (the hole in the gums) as soon as possible. The tooth is most likely to survive if it goes back in within 15 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Here are some tips for putting a tooth back in its socket:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hold it on the end that normally sticks out</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gently rinse the tooth socket with tap water</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Put the tooth back in its socket with your fingers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have the child bite on a towel to hold the tooth in place</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Get to a dentist right away</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you must wait to put the tooth back in, you can put it in cold milk or the child's saliva. If possible, it is even better to put the tooth in a special liquid for knocked-out teeth (sample brand names: ViaSpan, Hank's <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanced-salt-solution-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Balanced Salt Solution</a>). Then, get the tooth in its socket within an hour.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225183\"><span class=\"h1\">How are injuries to other parts of the mouth treated in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on where the injury is, what kind of injury it is, and how bad it is. Your child might not need any treatment. In some cases, your child might need:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stitches to fix a cut on the tongue or lips</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery, if your child pierces the back of his or her throat with an object and it is still stuck in the throat. This can happen if your child falls with something in his or her mouth, such as a pencil, toothbrush, lollipop, or straw.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics to prevent or treat some infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tetanus shot to prevent serious disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225190\"><span class=\"h1\">Can mouth and dental injuries be prevented in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child can reduce his or her chances of getting mouth or dental injuries by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing a mouth guard during sports. The best type of mouth guard is made by a dentist just for your child.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sitting while eating. This is most important when eating something on a stick or with a straw.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting only food and drinks in his or her mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not eating in the car</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553225197\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mouth-and-dental-injuries-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Mouth and dental injuries in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
