More detailed discussions of the normal physiologic changes in the cardiopulmonary system during pregnancy are presented separately. This review will emphasize those changes that directly impact or are influenced by co-existent asthma.

Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio, and peak expiratory flow are stable to slightly increased in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. As in non-pregnant patients, the diagnosis of asthma can be confirmed by demonstrating reversible airflow limitation before and after bronchodilator inhalation or before and after initiation of empiric treatment for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The diagnosis of asthma and the pharmacologic treatment of asthma during pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asthma during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although spirometry is minimally affected by pregnancy, some pulmonary function test measurements do change during pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80850 \">figure 1</a>). Vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (TLC) are usually preserved during pregnancy due to increased mobility and flaring of the ribs and unimpaired diaphragmatic excursion, although TLC may decrease slightly in the last trimester. In contrast, residual volume (RV) and functional residual capacity (FRC) normally decrease during gestation due to diaphragm elevation from the enlarging uterus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal airway hyperresponsiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoprovocation challenge is generally avoided during pregnancy, so limited data are available about maternal airway hyperresponsiveness during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a small prospective study of 16 asthmatic women, for example, the airways became less hyperreactive in most patients during pregnancy, as shown by measurements of the PC20 (ie, the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> needed to produce a 20 percent fall in FEV<sub>1</sub>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65099 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These changes did not correspond to changes in the levels of estriol or progesterone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal arterial blood gases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minute ventilation increases during pregnancy, presumably due to increased circulating levels of progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The increase in minute ventilation, which exceeds metabolic demands, lowers alveolar and arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) while simultaneously increasing alveolar and arterial oxygen tension (PAO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub>). The resulting respiratory alkalosis induces secondary compensation through renal loss of bicarbonate. Thus, normal blood gases during pregnancy reveal a higher PaO<sub>2</sub> (100 to 106 mmHg [13.1 to 14.1 kPa]) and a lower PaCO<sub>2</sub> (28 to 30 mmHg [3.72 to 3.99 kPa]) than in the non-pregnant state, typically accompanied by a slightly alkalotic pH.</p><p>During an acute asthma exacerbation, any associated changes in blood gases are superimposed on the &quot;normal&quot; respiratory alkalosis of pregnancy. Thus, a PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;35 mmHg (4.66 kPa) or a PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;70 mmHg (9.31 kPa) associated with acute asthma represent more severe compromise during pregnancy than in the non-gravid state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial oxygen tension PaO<sub>2</sub> in the fetus is only about one-third to one-fourth the PaO<sub>2</sub> in the adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The fetus normally thrives at this low oxygen level due to a number of compensations, such as fetal hemoglobin and changes in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. However, fetal oxygenation may be threatened in a number of ways that are potentially relevant to gestational asthma. First, maternal hypoxemia directly reduces oxygen supply to the fetus. Second, hypocapnia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alkalosis itself may cause fetal hypoxia, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Finally, reduction in uterine blood flow (potentially due to exogenous or endogenous vasoconstrictors, dehydration, hypotension, or significant maternal alkalosis) may compromise fetal oxygenation.</p><p>It appears that the fetus can compensate for hypoxemia in a number of ways, including redistribution of circulation to vital organs, decreased gross body movements, and increasing tissue oxygen extraction. The exact level and duration of fetal hypoxemia that exceed these compensatory mechanisms are not defined in humans. A common response to chronic hypoxia is deferment of growth needs in favor of vital functions, resulting in a small for gestational age fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY ON ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical effect of pregnancy on asthma is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,8,9,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9,19,20</a>].

Being overweight or obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and excessive first trimester weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] have been identified as risk factors for asthma exacerbations during pregnancy. These exacerbations are not uniformly distributed over the course of pregnancy. In one observational study that followed 504 pregnant asthmatic patients, exacerbations occurred most frequently during weeks 17 through 24 of pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73070\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73070 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Maternal arterial blood gases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of asthma during pregnancy is based on the demonstration of reversible airflow obstruction by spirometry. However, bronchoprovocation challenge is usually avoided during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Maternal pulmonary function'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, asthma worsens during pregnancy in a third of patients, improves in a third, and is unchanged in a third. However, other studies suggest that asthma severity prior to pregnancy is related to asthma severity during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Effects of pregnancy on asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma exacerbations affect 20 to 36 percent of pregnant asthmatic patients and tend to occur during the middle trimester. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute exacerbations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational asthma is associated with a relatively small but statistically significant increase in pregnancy complications, such as perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, and preterm delivery. However, appropriate therapy and good asthma control probably minimize these complications.
