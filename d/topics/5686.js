DILI accounts for approximately 10 percent of all cases of acute hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and it is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. DILI is also the most frequently cited reason for withdrawal of medications from the marketplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. DILI may not be detected prior to drug approval, because most new drugs are tested in fewer than 3000 people prior to drug approval. As a result, cases of DILI with an incidence of 1 in 10,000 may be missed. It has been suggested that for every 10 cases of alanine aminotransferase elevation (&gt;10 times the upper limit of normal) in a clinical trial, there will be one case of more severe liver injury that develops once the drug is widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Several risk factors have been associated with the development of DILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In general, adults are at higher risk for DILI than children (with the notable exception of DILI from valproic acid, which is more common in children). Women may be more susceptible to DILI than men, which may in part be due to their generally smaller size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Chronic liver injury can resemble other causes of chronic liver disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, or alcoholic liver disease. In some patients, chronic injury secondary to DILI progresses to cirrhosis.</p><p>DILI cholestasis is defined as an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to ALP ratio of less than 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76892 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The presence of jaundice (serum bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal) in association with an elevation in serum aminotransferases (&gt;3 times the upper limit of normal) is associated with a worse prognosis (an observation noted by Hyman Zimmerman and known as &quot;Hy's law&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/29,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33-35</a>].

Patients with acute DILI who are symptomatic may report malaise, low-grade fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, acholic stools, or dark urine. In addition, patients with cholestasis may have pruritus, which can be severe, leading to excoriations from scratching. Hepatomegaly may be present on physical examination. In severe cases, coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy may develop, indicating acute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with chronic DILI may go on to develop significant fibrosis or cirrhosis and have signs and symptoms associated with cirrhosis or hepatic decompensation (eg, jaundice, palmar erythema, and ascites).

The diagnosis includes obtaining a thorough history and performing blood tests to look for other causes of hepatic injury. If there is evidence of cholestasis, imaging to rule out biliary obstruction is also indicated. If testing for alternative causes of liver injury is negative and the patient has been exposed to a drug known to be associated with hepatic injury, we typically do not proceed with a liver biopsy. However, if the diagnosis remains uncertain (particularly in the setting of acute liver failure) or if there is clinical evidence of chronic liver disease, a liver biopsy should be obtained. A transjugular approach may be needed in patients with a coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19404856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18155526\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing causality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosing DILI can be difficult. It depends on obtaining a careful drug use history and ruling out other potential causes of liver injury. There are no specific serum biomarkers or characteristic histologic features that reliably identify a drug as the cause of hepatic injury. The general approach to evaluating a patient with abnormal liver tests is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The key elements for attributing liver injury to a drug include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug exposure preceded the onset of liver injury (although the latent period is highly variable)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying liver disease is excluded</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping the drug leads to improvement in the liver injury </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid and severe recurrence may occur if there is repeated exposure to the drug (however, rechallenge is not advised)</p><p/><p>Another factor that supports a diagnosis of DILI is hepatic injury occurring in the setting of exposure to a drug with a history of causing DILI in other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Identifying the offending drug may be difficult for several reasons. Obtaining a reliable drug history can be challenging. Reviewing a patient's pharmacy records may help confirm the medications the patient is taking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Even when a reliable drug history is available, the relationship between exposure to the drug and hepatic toxicity is not always clear. Patients may be taking multiple medications, making identification of a single offending agent difficult. In addition, patients may have concomitant liver disease, which can produce similar clinical and laboratory features.</p><p>The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) developed a series of standard designations of drug-induced liver disorders and classification of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Hepatotoxicity Steering Committee proposed modifications to the CIOMS classification scheme for classifying hepatotoxicity in clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76892 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>A number of scales have been developed that attempt to codify causality of drug toxicity into objective criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Examples include the CIOMS Roussel-Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) scale and the Maria &amp; Victorino (M &amp; V) clinical scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/25,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,42-44</a>]. However, they do not address all risk factors in all patients, and none of these scales are used routinely in clinical practice. The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) developed the DILIN Causality Scoring System to adjudicate the causality of drug-induced injury for patients enrolled into its prospective clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This model relies on structured expert opinion, and when compared with the RUCAM, it produces higher agreement rates and likelihood scores. However, intraobserver variability remains significant in both scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Unfortunately, the DILIN scale is not a clinically viable option for assessing causality, because it relies on expert opinion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18155532\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic findings in patients with DILI differ based on the mechanism of injury (eg, hepatocellular injury or cholestatic injury) and often mimic other causes of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. While histologic findings are not diagnostic for a specific cause of DILI, the pattern of injury may provide clues to the etiology of the liver injury and may help to rule out other causes of liver injury (eg, Wilson disease and hemochromatosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70335 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute hepatocellular</strong> <strong>injury</strong> &ndash; DILI leads to acute hepatocellular injury in about 90 percent of cases of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Histologically, acute portal and parenchymal hepatocellular injury leads to hepatocellular necrosis or apoptosis, steatosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cellular degeneration. Hepatocellular injury can be spotty, affecting single isolated hepatocytes, or it can be confluent, affecting groups of hepatocytes. Confluent necrosis, the death of larger groups of hepatocytes, can be zonal or nonzonal, depending on the offending agent. If extensive, confluent necrosis leads to bridging, submassive, or massive necrosis and can result in acute liver failure. Severe confluent necrosis will show collapsed hepatic parenchyma intermingled with bile ductular reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Most acute hepatocellular injury recovers without the development of significant fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Zonal necrosis is characteristic of compounds with predictable, dose-dependent, intrinsic toxicity, such as halothane (zone 3), carbon tetrachloride (zone 3), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (zone 3), yellow phosphorus (zone 2), beryllium (zone 2), cocaine (zone 1), or iron sulfate (zone 1). Isolated necrosis in zones 1 and 2 is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Centrilobular (zone 3) necrosis is the most common type of zonal necrosis seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with chronic cholestasis develop vanishing bile duct syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. In this setting, prolonged damage leads to the loss of bile ducts and overt ductopenia. In rare cases, a progression to cirrhosis and ultimately liver failure results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60162666\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventing drug-induced liver injury (DILI) includes educating patients taking hepatotoxic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>) on their safe use, including appropriate dosing and potential interactions with other drugs or alcohol. Patients should also be warned about signs and symptoms associated with hepatic injury. Whether to monitor for DILI by checking alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels during treatment with a known hepatotoxin is controversial. In some cases acute liver failure has developed in patients who were undergoing screening, and the significance of mild ALT elevations is not always clear and may lead to inappropriate discontinuation of a needed medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-liver-injury/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Our approach is to monitor the ALT level in patients taking medications associated with relatively high incidences of severe liver injury, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

(See <a href=\"#H156230473\" class=\"local\">'Associated drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DILI can be classified in several ways, including by its clinical presentation (hepatocellular injury, cholestatic injury, or mixed injury), the mechanism of hepatotoxicity (predictable or idiosyncratic), and the histologic findings (eg, hepatitis, cholestasis, and steatosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74021 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H68083470\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with DILI are asymptomatic and are only detected because of laboratory testing. Patients with acute DILI who are symptomatic may report malaise, low-grade fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, acholic stools, or dark urine. In addition, patients with cholestasis may have pruritus. In severe cases, hepatic encephalopathy may develop, indicating acute liver failure. Patients with chronic DILI may go on to develop significant fibrosis or cirrhosis and have signs and symptoms associated with cirrhosis or hepatic decompensation (eg, jaundice, palmar erythema, and ascites). (See <a href=\"#H156226461\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hepatocellular injury have a disproportionate elevation of their aminotransferases, whereas patients with cholestatic injury predominantly have an elevation of their alkaline phosphatase. Serum bilirubin may be elevated both with hepatocellular and cholestatic injury. DILI is generally considered clinically significant if the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is more than three times the upper limit of normal, if the serum alkaline phosphatase is more than twice the upper limit of normal, or if the total bilirubin is more than twice the upper limit of normal and is associated with any elevation of the ALT or alkaline phosphatase. (See <a href=\"#H18157466\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific symptoms developing after introduction of a drug (such as nausea, anorexia, malaise, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, or pruritus) may indicate drug toxicity and should prompt an evaluation for DILI. Making a diagnosis of DILI can be difficult. It depends on obtaining a careful drug use history and ruling out other potential causes of liver injury. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary treatment for DILI is withdrawal of the offending drug and monitoring to ensure the liver tests normalize. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recovery will occur in the majority of patients with DILI once the offending medication is stopped.
