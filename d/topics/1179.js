The many causes of acute vision loss and the time-sensitive need for evaluation and treatment pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A careful history is key to narrowing the differential diagnosis and will allow for a more focused physical examination. Prompt diagnosis and treatment may influence the visual outcome.</p><p>This topic will present an overview of the approach to patients with acute persistent visual loss. Transient visual loss, the differential diagnosis of the red eye, and specific causes of acute vision loss are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular or binocular visual loss)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF TERMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute persistent visual loss is defined as lasting at least 24 hours and is typically not caused by transient ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Acute transient visual loss is defined as a sudden deficit in visual function in one or both eyes lasting less than 24 hours. It is caused by a temporary vascular occlusion in the circulation to the eye or visual cortex, or by neuronal depression after a seizure or migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular or binocular visual loss)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To achieve clear vision, light must follow an unhindered path from the front to the back of the eye, traveling through the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor to the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67844\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67844 \">figure 1</a>). Refracted by the cornea and lens (and perhaps also by glasses or contact lenses), light is focused onto the retina where it is transformed into an electrochemical signal by photoreceptors and supporting cells. The signal is transmitted via the optic nerve through the visual pathways to the occipital lobes.</p><p>Alterations in function of any of the structures along the visual pathway may cause vision loss. Pathology can be broadly divided into three major anatomic categories: media, retina, and neural visual pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61855 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Media problems include keratopathy, hyphema (anterior chamber opacification by blood), lens changes, vitreous hemorrhage, the cellular infiltrates of uveitis, and endophthalmitis.</p><p>Retinal problems includes vascular occlusion, retinal detachment, and acute maculopathy.</p><p>Neural visual pathway problems may be subdivided into optic nerve, chiasmal, and retrochiasmal pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Media problems</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keratitis is inflammation of the cornea due to trauma, abrasive exposure, allergy, or infection. It is marked by cloudiness, irregularity, or loss of epithelial or sub-epithelial corneal tissues. Typically the eye is tearing, red, and painful or irritated.</p><p>Loss of epithelial cells is demonstrated by corneal uptake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> dye, creating a focal or diffuse green glow under a cobalt blue light. Deeper corneal disease may be visible as a focal or diffuse white opacity, or by dulling of the usually distinct reflection of light off of the cornea (corneal light reflex). The most common causes of keratitis are infection (viral, bacterial, fungal) and trauma. Both can also cause corneal edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Corneal edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corneal swelling results in loss of corneal clarity. Examination may reveal dulling of the corneal light reflex or a frank grey or white color to the substance of the cornea.</p><p>A serious cause of sudden corneal edema is acute angle-closure glaucoma. The patient with severely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) typically has nausea and vomiting and may see colored halos around lights. The eye is tearing, red, and extremely painful, often with ipsilateral brow ache. In angle closure, the pupil may be fixed in a mid-dilated position, and biomicroscopic (slit lamp) examination may reveal a shallow anterior chamber. IOP is often dangerously elevated (usually 40 to 80 mmHg). If formal tonometry is not available, severely elevated IOP may be suspected by noting hardness to palpation in comparison to the fellow eye. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angle-closure glaucoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyphema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hyphema is blood in the anterior chamber. It may result from blunt trauma or may occur spontaneously in a handful of conditions marked by abnormal growth or fragility of iris blood vessels (eg, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus). Biomicroscopic examination reveals red blood cells circulating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> layered in the anterior chamber. IOP may become dangerously elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Lens changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in the size, clarity, or positioning of the crystalline lens may alter the focus of light onto the retina, resulting in visual disturbance. Trauma or a variety of congenital conditions can lead to lens dislocation and resultant vision loss. Lens clouding (cataract) does not typically occur acutely, except in the setting of trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopia-lentis-dislocated-lens-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopia lentis (dislocated lens) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Elevated blood glucose can cause increased lens tumescence, altering the refractive error. If the change is great enough, patients may perceive vision loss. Vision impairment typically resolves within days to weeks of normalization of blood glucose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitreous hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding into the vitreous humor can occur in the setting of trauma, spontaneous retinal tear, spontaneous vitreous detachment, or any condition with retinal neovascularization such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.</p><p>The reduction in vision is directly proportional to the amount of blood in the vitreous. If the hemorrhage is dense enough, there may be a decreased red reflex (the reddish orange reflection off the subretinal layers when examining the eye with an ophthalmoscope), or the retina may not be visible with ophthalmoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Uveitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uveitis is the general term for inflammation inside the eye. Inflammation of the anterior structures of the eye typically is associated with red, painful light sensitivity, whereas isolated inflammation of intermediate and posterior structures may be associated with normal general appearance of the eye with decrease in the red reflex <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient complaint of new floaters. Biomicroscopic examination reveals white blood cells in the anterior chamber, vitreous space, or both. A hypopyon (white blood cell accumulation) may form in the anterior chamber. Corneal edema and a decreased red reflex may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endophthalmitis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The most important cause of acute persistent visual loss in this category is acute endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis is a serious bacterial or fungal infection of all intraocular tissues, caused by surface organisms (usually in the setting of recent ocular surgery) or bloodborne pathogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-endophthalmitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial endophthalmitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-endogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of endogenous endophthalmitis due to Candida species&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-exogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of exogenous endophthalmitis due to Candida species&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of endophthalmitis due to molds&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute retinal necrosis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Acute retinal necrosis (also known as acute viral panuveitis) is a rare and serious cause of visual loss. It is usually caused by herpesviruses and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Acute retinal necrosis (ARN)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections&quot;, section on 'Viruses'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other etiologies for uveitis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinal problems</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinal artery occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis, embolism, or arteritis of the central retinal artery results in retinal ganglion cell damage, leading to severe, sudden, painless, central or paracentral visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central and branch retinal artery occlusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Within minutes to hours of the occlusion, the only abnormality noted on ophthalmoscopy may be vascular narrowing. An embolus is visible in about 20 percent of patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After several hours, the inner layer of the retina becomes ischemic, turning milky white, except in the fovea, which appears as a cherry-red spot. An afferent pupillary defect is typically present. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of giant cell arteritis (GCA) must be ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Giant cell arteritis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinal vein occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis of the central retinal vein results in venous stasis, leading to disc swelling, diffuse nerve fiber <span class=\"nowrap\">layer/pre-retinal</span> hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots that create a dramatic appearance, often called &quot;the blood and thunder&quot; fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72976\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72976 \">picture 1</a>). Treatments include intravitreal injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents or corticosteroids and application of retinal laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vein occlusion: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vein occlusion: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While vision loss may be severe, the onset is typically subacute in contrast to the sudden visual loss typical of CRAO. When venous stasis is severe, infarction may occur due to slowed retinal blood flow on the arterial side. In this setting, a relative afferent pupillary defect is often present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detachment of the neurosensory retina may occur spontaneously or in the setting of trauma. The most common form is related to a tear or break in the retina in patients with a preexisting area of retinal thinning (usually highly myopic, or nearsighted, individuals). Patients may describe sudden onset of new floaters or black dots in their vision, often accompanied by flashes of light (photopsias). In its early stages, a detachment may present as a persistent missing portion of the monocular visual field. Once the macula (central retina) has become involved, visual acuity will be severely compromised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-detachment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal detachment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Retinal detachment is not painful and does not cause a red eye. There may be a dulling of the red reflex, and ophthalmoscopic examination may reveal the retina to be elevated with folds. If the detachment is extensive, there may be a relative afferent pupillary defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute maculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that affect the macula are associated with a central blind spot (scotoma), blurred vision, or visual distortion. Alteration of the macula due to fluid leakage, bleeding, infection, inflammation or other causes can occur de novo or as an acute worsening of a chronic disease (eg, new edema in previously dry diabetic retinopathy, or new bleeding in previously dry macular degeneration). Diagnosis usually requires detailed ophthalmoscopy with a high magnification lens through pharmacologically dilated pupils.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2813894390\"><span class=\"h2\">Neural visual pathway problems</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Optic nerve lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optic nerve lesions usually produce monocular visual loss. Optic neuritis is the most common cause of optic nerve disease in younger adults, while ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common etiology in older patients. Acute visual loss can also occur when orbital cellulitis spreads to infect and damage the optic nerve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic neuropathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H459379620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Extraorbital extension'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemic optic neuropathy</strong> &ndash; Ischemic optic neuropathy is generally categorized as anterior (affecting the optic disc) or posterior (retrobulbar) and as arteritic or nonarteritic. The arteritic designation refers to instances associated with GCA. Infarction at the optic nerve head due to thrombosis or transient hypotension leads to a superior or inferior altitudinal visual field defect, or diffusely reduced vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An afferent pupillary defect is typically present (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below). In anterior optic neuropathy, the optic disc is swollen, often accompanied by splinter hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66013 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50320\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50320 \">picture 3</a>). If nerve damage occurs posterior to the globe, no abnormalities may be seen on initial ophthalmoscopic exam. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonarteritic-anterior-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">GCA must be ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Giant cell arteritis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Optic neuritis </strong>&ndash; Inflammation of the optic nerve may be associated with a variety of conditions, most notably multiple sclerosis. Optic neuritis is the presenting feature in 15 to 20 percent of patients with multiple sclerosis, and it occurs at some time during the course of the disease in 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-neuritis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic neuritis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Affected patients note pain on eye movement, reduced visual acuity, and washed out color vision. An afferent pupillary defect is typically present (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below), and the optic disc is either normal or swollen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Papilledema</strong> &ndash; Elevated intracranial pressure can lead to transient visual obscurations or mild persistent blurred vision. Examination reveals bilateral optic nerve swelling without relative afferent pupillary defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-differential-diagnosis-of-papilledema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and differential diagnosis of papilledema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Chiasmal disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of the chiasm is suggested by visual loss of any type associated with pituitary dysfunction or by a monocular or bitemporal hemianopia.</p><p>Compressive chiasmal lesions typically cause gradual decline in vision, as they impinge upon the chiasm, optic nerve, or optic tract. Peripheral vision loss is often asymptomatic until visual acuity is compromised; therefore, most visual complaints are of gradual blurring or dimming of vision. Sudden chiasmal vision loss is less common and implies a rapidly expanding mass or an infectious, vascular, or inflammatory cause.</p><p>Ophthalmic examination may reveal optic disc pallor if the process is longstanding. Optic disc swelling may result from papilledema (with third ventricle obstruction causing elevated intracranial pressure) or from an infiltrative or inflammatory process.</p><p>Chiasmal visual field defects classically involve the temporal fields and respect the vertical midline in one or both eyes. Defects of ocular motility, due to palsies of the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve, may accompany chiasmal lesions that extend into the cavernous sinus.</p><p>Pituitary apoplexy is relatively rare, occurring predominantly in patients with preexisting adenoma. Emergency steroid and other hormonal replacement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transsphenoidal surgery, is often indicated. The clinical syndrome is characterized by the acute onset of visual loss, headache, ophthalmoplegia, and altered mental status due to hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland, resulting in rapid expansion into the suprasellar space and cavernous sinuses. Clinical suspicion mandates magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as computed tomography (CT) may miss the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Retrochiasmal disorders</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Homonymous hemianopia</strong> &ndash; Brain lesions in the region of the optic tract, the lateral geniculate body, the optic radiations, or the visual cortex produce a loss of vision on one side of both visual fields (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74068 \">figure 2</a>). The visual field defect is relatively symmetric and respects the vertical midline. No other abnormalities are seen on ophthalmic examination. The most common cause is stroke or hemorrhage into a brain tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=homonymous-hemianopia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Homonymous hemianopia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cortical blindness</strong> &ndash; Extensive bilateral damage to the cerebral visual pathways may result in complete loss of vision. Rarely, patients may confabulate and deny blindness, exhibiting a condition known as Anton syndrome. Other than blindness, no other abnormalities are seen on ophthalmic examination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychogenic problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients describing visual loss without an organic basis are said to have &quot;functional&quot; visual loss. Patients who are purposely feigning blindness are malingerers, whereas those who truly perceive blindness have a conversion disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis#H2516790\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conversion disorder in adults: Terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Malingering'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity#H13158915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conversion disorder in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and comorbidity&quot;, section on 'Visual symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>The visual loss may be monocular or binocular, total, or sub-total.</p><p>Malingerers have been known to pharmacologically alter pupillary function.</p><p>Once organic disease has been ruled out, sophisticated ophthalmic techniques and slights of hand may be required for proper diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care practitioners in the urgent setting most often do not have the equipment or expertise to perform a comprehensive ophthalmic examination. Key history and physical examination findings can help determine the general category, if not the specific etiology, of vision loss. A symptomatic approach to the differential diagnosis is presented in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72615\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72615 \">table 2</a>) and in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50345\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50345 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history of present illness should include inquiry about the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing &ndash; A distinction must be made between sudden onset of visual loss and sudden discovery of preexisting visual loss. If the normal eye is inadvertently covered, a longstanding or gradual loss of vision in the other eye may be mistaken for acute loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laterality &ndash; Bilateral loss often suggests a retrochiasmal visual pathway disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality &ndash; Monocular loss of a portion of peripheral vision suggests subtotal retinal detachment, ischemic optic neuropathy, or branch retinal vascular occlusion. However, patients with a homonymous visual field defect often perceive vision loss only in the eye ipsilateral to the visual field cut.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain &ndash; Keratitis produces a sharp superficial pain, acute glaucoma produces a deep brow ache with nausea and vomiting, endophthalmitis and certain uveitic conditions may also produce a deep boring pain, and optic neuritis produces pain worse with eye movement. Other causes of vision loss are typically painless.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness &ndash; Patients with keratitis, acute glaucoma, and uveitis usually present with conjunctival hyperemia (red eye).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms &ndash; Neurologic deficits can accompany a stroke (homonymous defect) or multiple sclerosis (optic neuritis). Nausea and vomiting accompany severely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Rhinorrhea is common when tearing is present. Some patients with monocular or binocular vision loss complain of a vague sense of disorientation or difficulty with balance and depth perception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma &ndash; Mild trauma can cause keratitis or uveitis; more severe trauma can cause hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, retinal detachment, or traumatic optic neuropathy. Trauma with a sharp or blunt object may produce a ruptured globe.</p><p/><p>Elements of the past medical history should focus on the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular disease &ndash; Patients with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercoagulability, or vascular risk factors are at increased risk for retinal vascular occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, or visual pathway stroke. Patients with preexisting diabetic retinopathy can experience a vitreous hemorrhage or acute maculopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refractive status &ndash; Highly nearsighted (myopic) eyes have a higher incidence of retinal tears, leading to retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients who have had refractive surgery to correct for myopia still have increased risk.

Media problems include keratitis, corneal edema, hyphema, lens changes, vitreous hemorrhage, and uveitis. Retinal problems include vascular occlusion, retinal detachment, and acute maculopathy.
