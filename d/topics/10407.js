Additionally, feeding problems such as food aversion and limited acceptance of a variety of foods may occur in children with food allergies and may significantly contribute to poor energy and overall nutrient intake. Certain food allergic disorders, such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and gastroenteritis, are more commonly accompanied by poor appetite and early satiety, potentially contributing to decreased energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Diets must be carefully planned to meet protein needs for optimal growth and nutrition when high-quality protein sources are eliminated from the diet.</p><p>Although rare in affluent countries when unrelated to chronic illness, cases of kwashiorkor have been reported in patients on elimination diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a review of 12 cases of kwashiorkor referred to tertiary care centers in the United States (age range 1 to 22 months), one-half were the result of a deliberate deviation from a standard diet due to suspected food allergies without adequate protein in the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Inadequate dietary protein intake may also contribute to decreased stature reportedly seen in children with food allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>].

The AMDR for protein is 5 to 20 percent for children 1 to 3 years of age, 10 to 30 percent for children 4 to 18 years of age, and 10 to 35 percent for adults. Dietary protein recommendations are based upon the assumption that energy intake is adequate. If energy intake is insufficient, free amino acids will be oxidized for energy, allowing for fewer available amino acids for anabolic and synthetic pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An estimated 65 to 70 percent of protein intake should come from sources of high biologic value, typically animal products, which contain a full complement of essential amino acids. Animal products are not necessary to provide optimal protein, but most alternative sources from plants (eg, legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, and vegetables) do not contain a full complement of essential amino acids. Thus, a diet without animal products requires greater dietary planning to ensure that a variety of plant-based foods are provided to meet essential amino acid needs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary history and recommended dietary intake in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vegetarian-diets-for-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vegetarian diets for children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary fat is an important source of energy, supports the transport of fat-soluble vitamins, and provides the two essential fatty acids (EFAs), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA). Assessing fat intake in the patient with food allergy is a simple but often overlooked step in the nutrition evaluation.</p><p>The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of total energy intake for older children and adults (30 to 40 percent for children one to three years of age). The risk of insufficient energy, vitamin E, and EFAs increases when fat intake falls below 20 percent of the total dietary energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. The AMDR for LA and ALA is 5 to 10 percent and 0.6 to 1.2 percent, respectively, for children one year of age and older and adults. Although EFA deficiency is rare, the amount and type of dietary fat present in the diet will determine if fat intake is healthful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Micronutrient deficiencies associated with malnutrition in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To meet fat recommendations (AMDR), most dietary fats should come from monounsaturated and polyunsaturated sources (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214 \">table 2</a>). Intake of saturated should be limited to &lt;10 percent of total energy intake in children &gt;2 years and adults. Trans fat intake should be kept as low as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children#H611096072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary recommendations for toddlers, preschool, and school-age children&quot;, section on 'Fat'</a>.)</p><p>The recommended intake for LA is easily met as LA is abundant in most diets and is found in a wide variety of vegetable oils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51635\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51635 \">figure 1</a>). ALA is less abundantly found, and the best sources tend to be from more commonly allergenic foods, such as fatty fish, certain nuts, and seeds.</p><p>Dietary fat is present in a wide variety of foods, such as dairy products, eggs, meat, fish, poultry, nuts, avocado, vegetable oils and margarines, and many convenience foods. Treatment of food allergy often results in the elimination of the allergen as well as many manufactured food products that contain the allergen. The resulting diet tends to come from primarily whole foods rather than processed foods, which may result in inadequate fat intake if additional fat is not added to the diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vegetable oils are easily added to the allergen-restricted diet when fat and EFA needs are not met (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51635\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51635 \">figure 1</a>). Refined oils (as opposed to expressed or expeller-pressed oils) do not contain significant amounts of allergenic protein and therefore are a safe form of dietary fats for most patients with food allergies. The amount and type of oil used is individualized based upon current dietary intake and degree and type of dietary restrictions. Adding fats that are predominantly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and those that contain at least 10 percent of daily EFA requirements are preferred.

Individuals with grain allergies may have an especially difficult time ingesting sufficient carbohydrates without appropriate grain substitutions. In addition to grains, other foods that contribute carbohydrates in the diet are fruits, vegetables, milk products, and legumes. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Wheat allergy'</a> below.)</p><p>The AMDR for carbohydrate is between 45 to 65 percent of total caloric intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> for children one year of age and older and adults, based upon the role of carbohydrates as the primary source of energy for the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Micronutrients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Micronutrients include vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.

However, there is a greater risk of insufficiency of certain nutrients, depending upon the food allergen(s) avoided.

However, dietary supplements may contain or be contaminated with the very food allergen(s) the patient is trying to avoid (even those products labeled allergen free).

The nutritional impact of cow's milk elimination in children is even greater since milk and milk products are the primary source not only of calcium and vitamin D, but also fat and protein for most children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74819 \">table 7</a>). Milk also provides vitamin B12, vitamin A, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), riboflavin, and phosphorus. Finding a nutritionally dense substitute for cow's milk in the pediatric diet is essential. Alternative dietary sources for these nutrients are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55081 \">table 3</a>).

However, nursing mothers of infants with CMA should do a trial of complete avoidance of milk protein in their diet if the infant has allergic symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> growth issues since immunologically recognizable proteins from the maternal diet can be found in breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The nutritional adequacy of the maternal diet may need to be assessed since dairy elimination can compromise maternal nutrient intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Maternal dietary calcium replacement or calcium supplementation (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> is recommended to maintain maternal stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Vitamin D and vitamin A concentration in breast milk is reduced if the maternal diet is deficient, but calcium content of breast milk may not be affected by maternal intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Although soy formula is tolerated by approximately 85 percent of infants with IgE-mediated CMA, the prevalence of hypersensitivity to both soy and milk is up to 60 percent for infants in the United States with non-IgE-mediated CMA, such as enterocolitis syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Another caveat in selecting a soy formula for infants &lt;4 to 6 months of age with CMA is that soy is not considered a good choice for atopy prevention in infants at high risk for allergy compared with hypoallergenic formulas. However, we generally do not switch infants with CMA to an eHF if they are already on a soy formula and tolerate it <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if cost or taste preferences preclude the use of hypoallergenic formulas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introducing formula to infants at risk for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Soy formula versus others'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introducing formula to infants at risk for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Formula selection for the high-risk infant'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Children &gt;1 year old</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants are usually transitioned from a complete formula or breast milk to whole cow&rsquo;s milk at approximately one year of age, usually around the time that at least two-thirds of the total daily caloric intake comes from a varied solid food diet. However, other criteria must be considered in the child with CMA, especially one with multiple food allergies, since a varied solid food diet may not be possible. Assessing the nutritional contribution of the solid food diet and the growth of the child as well as considering the nutritional benefits and pitfalls of the alternative beverages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74819 \">table 7</a>) before transitioning from a formula to a milk substitute is strongly advised. Hypoallergenic formulas or breast milk are the preferred substitute in children under two years of age. Soy beverage, if tolerated, or another alternative beverage with higher fat and protein content (eg, oat or hemp) if the child is also allergic to soy are options in the child over two years of age.</p><p>Continued use of commercially prepared complete formulas beyond infancy is recommended for children with multiple food allergies on very limited diets or for those avoiding both milk and soy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63667 \">table 9</a>). Enriched alternative beverage sources (usually soy, nut, seed, or grain based) generally do not provide comparable nutrition with whole cow's milk or formulas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74819 \">table 7</a>). Thus, the DRACMA summary report recommends substituting a hypoallergenic formula or breast milk for cow's milk until two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The use of enriched alternative beverages for children between one and two years of age is not recommended in general, but they can be used on an individual basis after dietary assessment.</p><p>Enriched soy beverage is an appropriate alternative for older toddlers, if tolerated, that provides dietary calcium, vitamin D, and protein sources similar to milk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74819 \">table 7</a>). It is important to confirm that the child is consuming an enriched version since unenriched alternative milk beverages are available. There is at least one reported case of a patient with rickets due to consumption of an unenriched soy beverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk of inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D among children with CMA is decreased if a dairy-free enriched soy beverage or commercially prepared hypoallergenic <span class=\"nowrap\">infant/toddler</span> formula is provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Soy beverage is generally lower in dietary fats, so additional fat in the form of vegetable oil may need to be added to the young toddler's diet.</p><p>For children with concomitant milk and soy allergy, enriched oat beverage provides calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and phosphorus but is lower in protein and fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74819 \">table 7</a>). Other enriched grain (eg, rice) and nut (eg, almond) beverages tend to be even lower in fat and protein than oat beverage. Enriched hemp beverage is seed based and would provide adequate fat but is low in protein. Protein requirements should be met entirely through solid foods in the diet before switching to enriched alternative grain or nut beverages. Fat intake may also need to be assessed. Additional fat in the form of vegetable oils may be required. When the child is ready to transition to an enriched alternative grain or nut beverage, intake should be limited to the amount required to meet calcium needs. Lastly, in addition to the poor nutritional quality of rice milk beverage, the presence of inorganic arsenic makes it a poor daily milk substitute for young children. Young children drink a relatively large amount of <span class=\"nowrap\">milk/milk</span> substitute relative to their body weight. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not issued specific guidance for the use of rice beverage as a milk substitute in young children, the European Food Standards Agency does not recommend the use of rice beverage as a daily milk substitute for children under 4.5 years of age based on the poor nutritional quality and inorganic arsenic content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Most alternative mammalian milks, such as goat's or sheep's milk, are also not suitable. Up to 92 percent of individuals with cow's milk protein allergies will also react to goat's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Donkey's or mare's milk may be better tolerated in some cases, although these milks are generally not commercially available.

However, a one year old must drink 16 ounces per day of a highly fortified juice (30 percent of the daily value for <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/serving)</span> to consume adequate calcium. Excessive intake of a nutritionally inferior milk substitute or juice may displace nutrients from other dietary sources resulting in subsequent deficiencies, particularly protein, fat, and energy.</p><p>There are numerous other &quot;dairy-free&quot; products on the market, such as soy or coconut-based yogurt and soy or rice-based cheese. However, not all &quot;dairy-free&quot; products are milk protein free; therefore, reading all ingredient labels is imperative. As an example, casein is an ingredient in a rice cheese brand. Additionally, many of these products are manufactured on shared equipment with milk products and run the risk of cross contact with milk. It is possible to find some dairy-like products that are truly milk protein free and manufactured on dedicated equipment. The nutritional contribution of these foods should be evaluated, however, as they are not comparable with the milk versions. As an example, coconut yogurt is essentially protein free. In addition, these products typically are not enriched.

Four servings of wheat-based products, such as whole grain and enriched cereals or breads, generally provide greater than 50 percent of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for carbohydrate, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin for individuals one year of age and older and are a significant source of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, vitamin B6, and magnesium. Whole grain wheat products also contribute fiber to the diet. Alternative dietary sources of these macro- and micronutrients should be provided when wheat is eliminated from the diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54072 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grain-allergy-allergens-and-grain-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grain allergy: Allergens and grain classification&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient with an allergy to wheat must avoid all wheat-containing foods, resulting in the elimination of many processed and manufactured products including bread, cereal, pasta, crackers, cookies, and cakes. Wheat is also commonly used as a minor ingredient in other commercial food products, such as condiments and marinades, cold cuts, soups, soy sauce, some low or nonfat products, hard candies, licorice, jelly beans, and gummies.</p><p>Many alternative grains and flours are available to patients with wheat allergy, including rice, corn, oat, barley, buckwheat, rye, amaranth, millet, quinoa, tree nuts, and legumes, if tolerated. Some of these alternatives to wheat flour come from other commonly allergenic foods, such as nuts, so caution is warranted. Additionally, 20 percent of individuals with one grain allergy may be clinically reactive to another grain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Thus, use of these alternative products should be individualized and based upon tolerance as determined by the patient's allergy specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergens: Overview of clinical features and cross-reactivity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alternative grains may improve the nutritional quality, variety, and convenience of the wheat-restricted diet. Many of these are commercially available as flours for home use. In addition, there are a wide variety of wheat-free and gluten-free products made from these grains. One issue is that many of these flours and products are not well fortified. Additionally, they may be lower in fiber. When choosing alternatives to wheat, the nutritional quality of the alternative flour or product should be considered. Choosing whole or enriched grains greatly improves the nutritional quality of the diet. When baking with unenriched alternative flour, a safe, fortified infant cereal can be substituted for a portion of the alternative flour used in baked products to increase the quantity of nutrients such as iron, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Many foods supply the nutrients found in eggs, including milk, soy, meats, fish, and poultry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74067 \">table 5</a>). In addition, egg in the diet usually does not account for a large percentage of daily dietary intake. Thus, egg avoidance is unlikely to negatively impact nutritional intake. However, egg is a common ingredient in the Western diet; therefore, patients with egg allergy will need to learn how to replace egg in recipes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62743 \">table 10</a>). Many commercial egg substitutes are not suitable for the individual with egg allergy, since they contain egg protein; however, safe versions are available.
