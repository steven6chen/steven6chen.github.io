Patients (and family members) often ask what their future holds; thus, information regarding prognosis after MI is necessary for patient care.</p><p>The outcomes discussed in this topic, such as mortality, are presented using pooled data. However, the prognosis may vary widely between individuals, according to the presence or absence of risk factors present before the MI. These risk factors are discussed elsewhere.

For most patients with MI, clinicians should risk stratify them using validated risk prediction models. This process is described in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a report that evaluated the interval 1987 to 2002, the 28-day case fatality fell from 5.3 to 3.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A similar trend was noted in an analysis of data on 2.5 million patients from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction in which in-hospital mortality after an acute MI declined from 10.4 percent in 1994 to 6.3 percent in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">STEMI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 30-day mortality rate of patients with STEMI is between 2.5 and 10 percent in reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-15</a>]. </p><p>Both in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates after STEMI have been lower in clinical trials compared to registries and reports in patients not in clinical trials. This has been explained by enrollment of a lower risk population and better adherence to proven therapies in the former. Among patients with STEMI enrolled in trials, approximate in-hospital or 30-day mortality rates were 13 percent with medical therapy alone, 6 to 7 percent with optimal fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and as low as 3 to 5 percent with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when performed within two hours of chest pain onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,19</a>].

The reported in-hospital mortality has been reported between 7 and 9.7 percent and the 30-day mortality between 11.1 and 14 percent for patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20,21</a>]. A number of factors could contribute to this difference, including patient selection, less frequent use of appropriate therapies, and data collection before trials, supporting the value of primary PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20-22</a>].</p><p>More contemporary reports of patients not enrolled in trials have documented a continued decline in mortality in STEMI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12,13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,23</a>]. For example, outcomes were presented in a 2012 report of 6707 STEMI patients in four French nationwide registries conducted five years apart (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were significant decreases in crude 30-day mortality (from 13.7 to 4.4 percent) and mortality standardized to 2010 population characteristics (from 11.3 to 4.4 percent). These declines were seen irrespective of the type of reperfusion (fibrinolysis or PCI) and in patients who were not reperfused.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased, with a shorter time from onset to first call, and broader use of mobile intensive care units.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During this time, the average age fell and the prevalence of most risk factors increased</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of reperfusion therapy increased from 50 to 75 percent, driven mostly by an increase of the use of PCI, as did the use of recommended preventative medical therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within the STEMI population assessed in these registries, the relative proportion of older patients decreased, and the proportion of younger men and women increased. These registry data suggest that future strategies aimed at further reducing acute MI incidence and mortality will need to specifically target prevention in younger men and women.

Although an early invasive strategy is now performed in most patients, because of reductions in recurrent MI or rehospitalization for an ACS, mortality rates in randomized trials were not significantly reduced in-hospital (or at six months) by this strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>The following studies include the range of findings for patients not enrolled in randomized controlled clinical trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the GRACE registry of over 16,000 patients from 14 countries seen between 2001 and 2007, the in-hospital mortality was 3.3 percent with non-ST elevation ACS (NSTEACS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the French registry of 1645 patients with NSTEMI managed with an invasive strategy in 2005, the in-hospital mortality was 2.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Worcester (Massachusetts, United States) Heart Attack Study, the hospital and 30-day post-admission case fatality rates for 2005 were 9.5 and 14.0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">STEMI versus NSTEMI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term mortality is lower in patients with NSTEMI (2 to 4 percent) compared to patients with STEMI (3 to 8 percent) treated with primary PCI within two hours of hospital arrival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,18,19,21,25,26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,19,21,25,26,30</a>].

The risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality between 2007 and 2009 for the subset of acute MI patients who underwent PCI was about 6 percent for STEMI and about 4 percent for NSTEMI. For both types of MI, there were trends toward lower mortality with time.</p><p>Better short-term outcomes for patients with NSTEMI have also been noted in other studies (eg, in-hospital mortality 5 to 7 percent compared with 7.0 to 9.3 percent with STEMI in the GRACE and Euro Heart registries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20,21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12574987\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse non-fatal outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Besides death, other patient-important outcomes include stroke, recurrent MI, heart failure, and major bleeding.

In a single-community (Olmsted County, Minnesota, United States) study of 3010 patients who were hospitalized for a first-ever MI (31 percent STEMI) between 1987 and 2010, rehospitalization within 30 days occurred in about 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In an analysis of 23 published studies in which follow-up was completed prior to 1980, the death rate was about 28 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A report had a five-year death rate of about 21 percent in patients treated between 1989 and 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>In contrast to the short-term outcomes, which are worse with ST-elevation MI (STEMI), long-term outcomes have been similar or worse with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,25,37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25,37-41</a>]. The largest direct comparison comes from the GUSTO-IIb trial performed in the early 1990s of 12,142 patients with STEMI, NSTEMI (using only creatine kinase MB fraction, not troponins, for diagnosis), or unstable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The mortality rate at 30 days was lower with NSTEMI than STEMI (3.8 versus 6.1 percent). In contrast, the mortality at one year was similar (8.8 for NSTEMI versus 9.6 percent for STEMI). However, outcomes from patients with NSTEMI managed more recently were lower in the ISAR REACT 4 trial, in which mortality at one year was about 4.4 percent.

Other registry reports suggest that, at one and two years, the cumulative mortality for NSTEMI exceeds that of STEMI patients. In the OPERA registry, cardiovascular outcomes were evaluated in 2151 consecutive patients (71 percent STEMI) with confirmed MI during 2002 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The STEMI patients were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (71 percent) or fibrinolytic therapy (29 percent), while PCI was performed in 52 percent of NSTEMI patients. In-hospital mortality was not different for both groups (4.6 versus 4.3 percent), while the one-year post-discharge mortality was higher with NSTEMI (8.2 versus 5.0 percent). In a report for the Worcester (Massachusetts, United States) Heart Attack Study, the one-year post-discharge case fatality rates in 2005 for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI were 8.4 and 18.7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Further evidence suggesting worse long-term outcomes with NSTEMI comes from a comparison of two studies that evaluated outcomes separately. A French registry evaluated outcomes in 1645 patients with NSTEMI managed with an invasive strategy during 2005 and found that mortality at three years was approximately 20 percent, with about half the deaths due to cardiovascular causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, mortality at three years was around 6 to 7 percent in the HORIZONS AMI trial of patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The GRACE Study investigated subjects at the time of an acute coronary syndrome event and the key variables were age, heart rate, systolic pressure, creatinine, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest at admission, ST segment deviation, and cardiac enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Other investigators have evaluated prognosis when the baseline evaluation is more than several months after a vascular disease event. For example, a report based on the two-year post-MI experience of 49,689 REACH Registry participants from around the world has shown that recurrent cardiovascular (CVD) disease and CVD death can be predicted with a simple algorithm. The core variables in the REACH prediction model were age, male sex, presence of peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, low body mass index, history of atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, history of a CVD event in the past year, and favorable effects on risk were seen for statins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Similarly, in the SMART Study, after 4.7 years of follow-up for 5788 Dutch adults with coronary disease, peripheral arterial disease, or cerebrovascular disease at baseline, the key predictor variables for recurrent vascular disease were age, male sex, smoking, systolic pressure, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and years since first vascular event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

However, the prognosis for an individual varies markedly according to the presence or absence of adverse risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short- and long-term death rates following MI have fallen substantially in the past few decades with improvements in medical care, particularly the widespread use of reperfusion techniques and the adjunctive use of multiple medical therapies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Short-term outcomes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The current 30-day mortality after all acute coronary syndromes (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], and unstable angina) is probably in the 2 to 3 percent range, but likely around 5 percent if patients with unstable angina are not included. (See <a href=\"#H632888902\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term mortality is lower in patients with NSTEMI (2 to 4 percent) compared to patients with STEMI (3 to 8 percent) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention within two hours of hospital arrival. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'STEMI versus NSTEMI'</a> above.) Long-term mortality is similar or worse with NSTEMI. At one year, mortality is around 5 to 9 percent.
