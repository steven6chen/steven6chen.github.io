Colonoscopy with ileoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and enteroscopy can usually differentiate between IBD and its mimics, particularly when augmented by results of histopathology. In addition, other modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography have considerable utility in the diagnosis and evaluation of complicated anorectal Crohn disease and in the differentiation of ulcerative colitis from Crohn&rsquo;s colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Beyond its diagnostic utility, GI endoscopy has an important role in the staging of severity of disease, evaluation and treatment of strictures, detection of postoperative recurrence, assessment of the efficacy of medical therapy, surveillance for neoplasms, and preoperative assessment, particularly in Crohn disease.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnostic accuracy of GI endoscopy, the major endoscopic findings that may be seen in patients with IBD, and some practical considerations regarding endoscopy in patients with suspected IBD. The current challenge is to select patients who will benefit from endoscopy, and to decide when to use other diagnostic modalities either in combination with or instead of endoscopy. The clinical manifestations and treatment of the different forms of this disorder are discussed separately.

Instead of reflecting light in large patches, the granular mucosa reflects a multitude of small points of light, giving the appearance of &quot;wet sandpaper&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many different scores have been used to assess the severity of the endoscopic lesions used in therapeutic studies. The score used in most drug studies is the Mayo endoscopic score of activity (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mayo-score-for-assessing-ulcerative-colitis-activity\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores corresponding with more severe disease. The endoscopic subscore ranges from 0 to 3.</p><p>The endoscopic findings in UC begin at the anal verge and extend proximally. The involvement is almost always continuous and circumferential, with inflammation beginning from the point of origin and continuing to a gradual transition to normal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76332\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76332 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A progressive increase in chronic inflammation in a proximal to distal pattern supports the diagnosis of UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Occasional patients with treated UC demonstrate rectal sparing or patchiness of distribution of inflammatory changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the prevalence of these findings is likely overestimated by standard evaluation with colonoscopy and endoscopic biopsy when compared with colectomy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, a subset of patients with UC has focal inflammation around the appendiceal orifice that is not contiguous with disease elsewhere in the colon (a &quot;cecal patch&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The distribution may also become patchy as a result of therapy.</p><p>Pseudopolyps are not specific for UC but are more common in this disorder, occurring in approximately 20 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76729\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76729 \">picture 2</a>). They can range from a few millimeters in diameter to a centimeter or more. They tend to be taller than they are wide and can mimic neoplasms; biopsy confirms that they are not neoplastic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pseudopolyps are associated with increased severity and more extensive involvement in UC. However, the outcome in patients with pseudopolyps is better than in those with similar disease extent and severity who do not have pseudopolyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Backwash ileitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Backwash ileitis refers to the presence of inflammation in the distal ileum in patients with ulcerative colitis. The term &quot;backwash&quot; evolved from a belief that the inflammation arose from exposure of the ileal mucosa to cecal contents, although the precise pathogenesis is not well understood. A detailed review of ileocolonic resection specimens in 200 patients in whom Crohn disease was definitively excluded found a prevalence of 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In most reports, the severity of ileal inflammation paralleled the severity of colonic inflammation and was more common in patients with pancolitis compared with those with only distal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. An association with an aggressive disease course, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and an increase risk of development of pouchitis following restorative proctocolectomy has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One study suggested that the presence of backwash ileitis may predict an increased risk of development of dysplasia and colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], although this observation has not been confirmed in other reports.</p><p>When faced with endoscopic findings of pancolitis and distal ileal inflammatory changes, it is important to obtain adequate mucosal biopsies to help distinguish Crohn ileocolitis from pan-ulcerative colitis with backwash ileitis. The presence of granulomatous inflammation on histology can help make this distinction, but when granulomata are absent, upper gastrointestinal and small bowel imaging may be useful. Finally, the use of serologic markers may be useful in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H12689190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Serologic markers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic findings in Crohn disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three major endoscopic findings that are specific for the diagnosis of Crohn disease and help to distinguish it from UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aphthous ulcers &ndash; Small discrete aphthous ulcers can be seen in early lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78561\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78561 \">picture 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Deeper ulcers involve the entire wall of the colon, in contrast to the ulcers in patients with UC, which involve only the mucosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cobblestoning &ndash; Serpiginous and linear ulcers can course for several centimeters along the longitudinal axis of the colon in Crohn disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68093 \">picture 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This type of ulceration results in the typical cobblestoning lesions; the deep linear ulcers are the &quot;cracks&quot; between the stones, while areas of inflamed or normal tissue form the &quot;stones&quot;.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuous lesions &ndash; Crohn disease lesions are typically discontinuous. They can be adjacent to normal tissue, resulting in &quot;skip areas&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71769 \">picture 5</a>). In contrast, UC tends to be continuous and taper out gradually. If a biopsy taken from endoscopically normal tissue adjacent to an ulcer shows normal histology, the ulcer is probably due to Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Other endoscopic findings that support the diagnosis of Crohn disease, but are not specific, include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal rectum supports the diagnosis of Crohn disease, since UC always involves the rectum. On the other hand, involvement of the left side of the colon in general is less common in Crohn disease than in ulcerative colitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of normal vasculature adjacent to affected tissue is seen in Crohn disease, while loss of vascularity and friability is more typical of UC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated involvement of the terminal ileum is highly suggestive of Crohn disease. Terminal ileitis or &quot;backwash ileitis&quot; can occur in UC, but is only seen in the setting of pancolitis, allowing the distinction from Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ileoscopy should always be attempted in patients with suspected Crohn disease; it adds little or no risk to a diagnostic colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Backwash ileitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The relationship between endoscopic and clinical severity is relatively weak, but statistically significant in Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Two scores have been developed (the CDEIS and the SES-CD score) for the assessment of the severity of endoscopic lesions in Crohn disease. These scores are used mostly in clinical drug trials in Crohn disease, in which mucosal healing has become one of the major endpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOSCOPY VERSUS RADIOGRAPHY IN ILEOCOLONIC IBD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease were traditionally diagnosed using clinical characteristics, radiologic studies, and proctosigmoidoscopy. However, radiographic studies are now considered an adjunctive rather than a primary diagnostic tool due to the nearly universal availability of colonoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Barium studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although currently seldom used in evaluating patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema may confirm the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and also help to determine the extent of colonic involvement. Other scenarios where barium enema may be useful include the evaluation of endoscopically impassable strictures and in those unusual circumstances when patients are unwilling or unable (due to medical comorbidities, etc) to undergo colonoscopy. However, there are two limitations to barium enema in this setting: it may be normal in mild forms of disease, and it should be avoided in those who are severely ill since it may precipitate ileus with toxic megacolon. For these and other reasons, the use of barium enema as an imaging modality in the diagnosis of IBD has practically disappeared from clinical practice. When additional imaging is required to supplement the diagnostic yield of endoscopic procedures, it is obtained from more precise imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other radiologic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other radiologic tests have been used in the diagnosis of IBD. These include ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), scintigraphy, and computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/22-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-28</a>]. A meta-analysis of prospective studies that used these modalities in the diagnosis of IBD found relatively good levels of diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Little difference in accuracy was found among these modalities and the authors stressed the need to limit the exposure to ionizing radiation given the chronic nature of IBD and the need for repeated re-evaluation. </p><p>The use of MRI for assessment of Crohn disease is expanding, and a number of studies are attempting to validate predictors of aggressive CD. Several groups are developing a Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. An advantage of MRI over CT is the lack of radiation exposure. Because of this, it is the preferred study in some centers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H12689169\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE IN DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical and radiographic presentation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be mimicked by a host of other disorders. As a result, gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has an indispensable role in the differential diagnosis of IBD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious colitis and/or ileitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several infectious agents can cause mucosal inflammation and look identical to either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis (UC) at colonoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67648 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51993\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51993 \">picture 6</a>). In one study of patients with mucoid bloody diarrhea and suspected inflammatory bowel disease, 38 percent were found to have an infectious colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As noted below, histologic findings may help to distinguish these disorders, with crypt distortion favoring the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In patients with ulcerative colitis, infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) can pose major diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Early diagnosis is essential and prior to the widespread use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, patient outcomes were frequently quite poor. One retrospective study suggested that certain endoscopic findings (wide mucosal defects, &quot;punched out&quot; ulcerations, linear ulcerations) may highly correlate with CMV colitis in patients with concomitant ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The self-limited nature of most episodes of infectious colitis often differentiates it from IBD without the need for endoscopy. Examination of the stool for ova and parasites, and aerobic and anaerobic culture are required for confusing cases.</p><p>Tuberculosis of the terminal ileum and cecum can mimic Crohn disease by producing a narrowed lumen and nodularity. The presence of caseating granulomas, positive culture, or acid fast bacilli on colonoscopic biopsy specimens establishes the diagnosis of tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other endoscopic findings suggestive of tuberculosis are grouped ulcers, nodules, and destruction of the ileocecal valve. Other authors have reported the association of certain clinical features (blood in the stool, weight loss, sigmoid colon involvement, and focally enhanced colitis) with intestinal tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It may be difficult to detect granulomas due to their deep location; thus, their absence does not rule out tuberculosis. Biopsies should be taken from the raised edematous margins and sent for histologic as well as bacteriologic tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other infectious agents can cause terminal ileitis and confusion with Crohn disease. In one prospective study, for example, 7 percent of 110 patients with suspected IBD based upon radiography had an eventual diagnosis of infectious colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition to tuberculosis, other causative agents included <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, and <em>Salmonella</em> caused ileitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67648 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudomembranous colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudomembranous colitis may resemble IBD. Small groups of pseudomembranes can look grossly like the aphthous ulcers of Crohn disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60237%7EGAST%2F53774\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60237 graphicRef53774 \">picture 7A-B</a>). However, the pseudomembranes are present on top of the mucosa, and do not result in ulceration of the underlying tissue.

The keys to proper diagnosis are sparing of the rectum in ischemic colitis and the presence of risk factors for ischemic colitis (eg, atherosclerotic disease, congestive heart failure, recent hypotension).

While this area may also be visualized by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema, colonoscopy with ileoscopy has improved accuracy. As an example, in a study of 110 patients with suspected Crohn disease based upon involvement of the terminal ileum on barium examination, only 48 (44 percent) had a final diagnosis of Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The positive predictive value of ileoscopy was 96 percent; there was only one false positive result on colonoscopy (due to <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> infection). Biopsies of the terminal ileum appear to have their greatest value in patients undergoing colonoscopy who are known to have or are strongly suspected of having Crohn disease or those with an abnormal imaging study of the terminal ileum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, some patients with evidence of active small bowel Crohn disease on CT enterography may have normal ileoscopy. This can occur if the distal ileum is not involved, or if the inflammation is confined to the intramural portion of the bowel wall and mesentery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SMALL BOWEL DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Wireless capsule endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with wireless capsule endoscopy in the diagnosis of Crohn disease is discussed separately.

However, other imaging modalities such as computed tomographic enterography, wireless capsule endoscopy, magnetic resonance enteroclysis, and magnetic resonance enterography have demonstrated diagnostic accuracy equivalent to or better than that of standard small bowel follow-through or enteroclysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/27,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,40-44</a>]. In addition, the MRI-based modalities avoid radiation exposure in patients requiring serial small bowel imaging over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Enteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Push enteroscopy can be used to evaluate suspected Crohn disease of the proximal to mid-small bowel. Its major limitations include the inability to examine all or most of the small intestine, patient discomfort, and the potential for complications related to the instrument itself or the associated overtube. The major utility of enteroscopy is for evaluation and biopsy of lesions seen radiographically or by capsule endoscopy.</p><p>Device-assisted enteroscopy (eg, double balloon and single balloon enteroscopy) represents a major advance in the direct endoscopic inspection of the small bowel. The instruments can be inserted orally or rectally and complete small bowel visualization can be achieved in up to 86 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Disadvantages include patient discomfort and very long procedure times. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-deep-small-bowel-enteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 4 percent of patients with Crohn disease have gastroduodenal involvement, which is most effectively diagnosed with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Gastroduodenal disease can present simultaneously with distal disease or at some time after the diagnosis of distal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Gastroduodenal disease is occasionally discovered prior to the development of distal disease or may occur in isolation.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of inflammatory disease isolated to the upper gastrointestinal tract includes sarcoidosis, peptic ulcer disease, nonspecific duodenitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, and Brunner's gland hyperplasia.</p><p>The endoscopic findings of gastroduodenal Crohn disease are similar to those of distal disease and include mucosal granularity, nodularity and friability. Stellate, linear, or serpiginous ulcers may be seen. Aphthous ulcers also occur. Histopathologic examination has an important role in confirming the diagnosis, particularly in isolated gastroduodenal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIRECTAL DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of endosonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is valuable in the diagnosis of perirectal complications of Crohn disease. A study comparing EUS and MRI with exam under anesthesia (EUA) found that EUS and MRI had similar accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Combining EUS with either MRI or EUA yielded optimal results. Rectal endosonography with a linear array probe may be more accurate than MRI in the diagnosis of complex anorectal Crohn fistulae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-imaging-tests-in-the-evaluation-of-anal-abscesses-and-fistulas#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of imaging tests in the evaluation of anal abscesses and fistulas&quot;, section on 'Endosonography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When feasible and safe, direct endoscopic visualization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract mucosa is of major value in the diagnosis of suspected inflammatory bowel disease. This benefit is especially related to the ability to obtain targeted mucosal biopsy specimens, which can often definitively establish the diagnosis. Patients should be carefully selected and previously evaluated with appropriate laboratory studies (including stool cultures) and, when indicated, imaging studies. As a general rule, endoscopy should be reserved for patients with apparently mild to moderate disease by history and clinical examination.</p><p>When there is diagnostic uncertainty, repeat colonoscopy can confirm or refute the initial diagnosis of either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. In one large series, repeat colonoscopy one to two years after the initial diagnosis (527 with ulcerative colitis and 228 Crohn disease) resulted in reclassification of the diagnosis in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In patients with established chronic colitis, colonoscopy can assist in the evaluation of acute exacerbations and rule out other diagnostic considerations such as ischemia, diverticulitis, <em>C. difficile</em>, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Endoscopy can also provide prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>In the case of patients presenting with acute colitis, limited examination with a flexible sigmoidoscopy may be all that is needed to establish a diagnosis. Depending upon the endoscopic appearance, many endoscopists may choose to extend the examination to a full colonoscopy, the primary benefit of which is to establish the extent of disease within the colon and to determine whether there is involvement of the terminal ileum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical colonoscopy bowel preparation may be too aggressive for patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), leading to increased diarrhea and bleeding. The preparation should be tailored to the individual patient. Clear liquids by mouth for several days and gentle tap water enemas, for example, may be all that is necessary in acutely ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some experts recommend limited colonoscopy without preparation in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Standard bowel preparation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> can also result in endoscopic and histologic artifactual changes. These changes are occasionally misinterpreted as representing active disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the usual contraindications (such as a perforated viscus, recent myocardial infarction, and severe diverticulitis), patients with severe acute colitis, toxic megacolon, or an inability to undergo adequate bowel preparation are not candidates for colonoscopy. Examining the distal colon with a flexible sigmoidoscope, particularly in suspected ulcerative colitis (UC), may provide sufficient diagnostic information with considerably less risk than a full colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specimens should be labeled according to segments from where they were obtained, since an intermittent pattern of inflammation can be helpful in differentiating Crohn disease from ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Biopsies should be obtained at multiple levels, even if the mucosa appears normal, since up to 40 percent of specimens obtained from grossly normal appearing tissue in patients with suspected IBD show inflammation on microscopic evaluation. This is particularly relevant in patients with presumed ulcerative colitis treated medically prior to undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy or those with primarily distal UC and findings of periappendiceal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,52</a>]. Close attention to details of the clinical presentation, imaging studies and serologic results, and clear communication with the pathologist are necessary in bringing clarity to these diagnostic dilemmas.</p><p>Biopsy of the terminal ileum further increases the diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Abnormal appearing tissue, polyps and masses should also be sampled to rule out concomitant neoplastic changes, and brushings and stool samples should be obtained if an infectious etiology is suspected.</p><p>Biopsy of micro-ulcers (less than 5 mm in size) has the highest diagnostic yield, followed by the edge of larger ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Findings of chronic inflammation support the diagnosis of IBD. Granulomas are highly suggestive of Crohn disease, but are found in only 5 to 24 percent of biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,53</a>].</p><p>Histology from a rectal biopsy is useful for differentiating IBD from self-limited (infectious) colitis. Crypt distortion with forked glands, crypt atrophy, and a villiform surface appearance support the diagnosis of IBD and are not usually seen with infectious colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria is also associated with IBD, but can be more subjective than crypt distortion. Changes in crypt architecture occur early in the course of the disease, being seen as soon as seven days after the onset of symptoms in patients with acute onset IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>A number of endoscopic features are common to both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, including pseudopolyps, loss of haustral folds, fibrotic strictures, and linear superficial scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The ability of histologic examination to differentiate these two inflammatory lesions is somewhat limited since the mucosa is only able to respond to inflammation in a limited number of ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
