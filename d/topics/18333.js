Urethritis is the medical term for when the urethra gets irritated or inflamed.</p><p>People who have urethritis can have pain, burning, or stinging when they urinate. They also sometimes have discharge, meaning they leak fluid from the penis or vagina. Men with urethritis can have redness or swelling at the tip of the penis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539583139\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes urethritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethritis is usually caused by an infection. The most common cause is a sexually transmitted infection. Sexually transmitted infections, often called STIs, are infections you can catch during sex.</p><p>STIs that can cause urethritis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chlamydia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gonorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mycoplasma genitalium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trichomoniasis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539583154\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of urethritis, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539583169\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. You will probably need to give a urine sample or a sample of fluid from your vagina (if you are a woman) to be tested. If you are a man, the doctor or nurse might also take a sample from your penis. If you are a woman, the doctor might also do a pelvic exam. It's also possible you will have a blood test. These tests can show if you have an infection and what kind.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539583184\"><span class=\"h1\">How is urethritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually involves taking antibiotics. If your doctor or nurse thinks you have urethritis, you will probably get treatment right away. You do not need to wait until your test results come back.</p><p>If you are treated for an STI, you should not have sex with anyone until 7 days after you start antibiotics and until you have no more symptoms.</p><p>If you learn that you have an STI, you should tell all the people you have had sex with recently. They might also be infected (even if they have no symptoms) and need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539583199\"><span class=\"h1\">Can urethritis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since urethritis is usually caused by an STI, you can reduce your chances of getting urethritis again by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a latex condom every time you have sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding sex when you or your partner has any symptoms that could be caused by an infection (such as itching, discharge, or pain with urination)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex</p><p/><p>If you had an STI at any time, your doctor or nurse might also check you for other STIs now or in the future. People can get more than one STI at the same time. Plus, STIs do not always cause symptoms, so it helps to check.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539583214\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Trichomoniasis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genital herpes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syphilis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genital herpes (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-of-hiv-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Symptoms of HIV infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barrier-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Barrier methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
