When this happens, it can keep the heart from pumping blood as well as it should. This can cause breathing problems, chest pain, and other symptoms.</p><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually caused by an abnormal gene that runs in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9604139\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some children show no symptoms, while others do.</p><p>People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes have a heart murmur. (A heart murmur is an extra sound that doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope.) A doctor or nurse might find a murmur during a routine exam, such as before a child starts playing sports.</p><p>Babies (under a year old) might also have symptoms, such as being much more tired than usual, breathing fast, or having trouble feeding.</p><p>Most children over the age of 1 year have no symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they can start in childhood or the teenage years. Symptoms are most common around puberty. Puberty is a term for the changes in the body that happen during the preteen and teen years. The symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing problems, especially during exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain that is often worse during exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting or feeling about to faint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart palpitations, which feel like the heart is pounding, beating hard or fast, or skipping beats</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9604169\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If a doctor thinks your child might have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, he or she can order tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures electrical activity in the heart. It involves sticking patches called &quot;electrodes&quot; onto the chest, arms, and legs. The patches have wires that connect to a special machine that measures the electrical activity in the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An ECG can show if the heart is beating in a normal pattern and rhythm. An ECG can also show thickening of the heart muscle. The doctor might have your child exercise during the test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An &quot;echocardiogram&quot; (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create an image of the heart. Doctors use it to see how thick the walls of the heart are, measure the spaces inside the heart, and see how well the heart pumps blood. The doctor might have your child exercise during the test or right beforehand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing &ndash; This can show if your child has the abnormal gene that some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have.</p><p/><p>Depending on your child's situation, he or she might need other tests, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;) &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your child's leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to the heart. The doctor can also put a dye that shows up on an X-ray into the tube. Cardiac cath can help measure pressure inside the heart and find problems caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac MRI <strong>&ndash;</strong> This test creates images of the heart. It can show parts of the heart that are hard to see with an echocardiogram and give doctors other information about the heart.</p><p/><p>If your child is found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, his or her siblings (brothers or sisters) should get tested for it, too. Tests include a physical exam as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram. Siblings usually need tests every year between the ages of 12 and 18. After the age of 18, most people only need to be tested once every 5 years. If your child has an abnormal gene, any brothers or sisters should get genetic testing to look for this, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181174531\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the doctor or nurse right away if your child has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has any of the symptoms listed above. Symptoms can include trouble breathing, chest pain, fainting, or heart palpitations. Babies might have trouble feeding or gaining weight.</p><p>The doctor can do tests and decide whether your child needs treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9604186\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child does not have symptoms, he or she probably will not need treatment. If symptoms happen, treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to help with chest pain or breathing problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control the heart's rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called a &quot;defibrillator&quot; &ndash; This can sense and control abnormal heartbeats. It is placed under the skin near the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors can do surgery to remove parts of the heart muscle. But this is done only when medicines do not work.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9604201\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It is important to ask your child's doctor what types of physical activity are safe for your child. Children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can have problems that make exercise dangerous or even life-threatening. Your child might need to avoid certain sports or activities. It's also important to make sure your child gets all his or her vaccines.</p><p>You can also make sure your child always drinks enough water. People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes have problems, such as fainting, when they do not get enough fluids. On the other hand, some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy need to be careful if they have too much salt and water. Ask your doctor what is safe for your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9604218\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child will probably need regular exams and tests, medicines, or other treatments. He or she might also need to avoid certain activities.</p><p>A few people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy get serious heart problems, but most people can &ndash; and do &ndash; live normal lives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9604235\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
