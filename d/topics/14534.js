Fractures of the humerus can occur proximally, in the shaft (diaphysis), or distally. The majority of both proximal and midshaft humerus fractures are nondisplaced and can be treated conservatively (nonsurgically). Complex fracture patterns pose greater challenges for treatment. </p><p>Proximal fractures of the humerus will be reviewed here. Nonstress and stress fractures of the shaft of the humerus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midshaft-humeral-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Midshaft humeral fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-humeral-shaft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the humeral shaft&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The humerus is the largest bone in the upper extremity. The proximal humerus articulates with the glenoid of the scapula to form the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81764\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81764 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54102 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69995 \">figure 3</a>). The muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff, the acromion, and ligamentous attachments, such as those between the coracoid process of the scapula and the acromion, both stabilize the glenohumeral articulation and provide for the shoulder&rsquo;s wide range of motion. The distal humerus articulates with the radius and ulna at the elbow.</p><p>According to the Neer classification, the proximal humerus is divided into four sections: the anatomical neck, the surgical neck, the greater tuberosity, and the lesser tuberosity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67578\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67578 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Neer classification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anatomical neck consists of the widened articular surface of the humeral head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgical neck is located at the constriction distal to the humeral head and tuberosities. The surgical neck is where the articular capsule attaches and several penetrating arteries enter to provide part of the vascular supply to the humeral head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greater and lesser tuberosities are the sites of attachment for the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027 \">figure 5</a>). The greater tuberosity is located lateral to the humeral head on the superior aspect of the humerus. It provides the attachment for three of the rotator cuff muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The lesser tuberosity is located on the anterior surface of the humerus and provides the attachment for the subscapularis muscle.</p><p/><p>The humeral shaft supplies the attachment for a number of powerful muscles. The pectoralis major inserts on the proximal shaft while the deltoid muscle attaches to the midshaft. The biceps brachialis and triceps muscle groups attach more distally.</p><p>The tendon of the long head of the biceps brachialis muscle passes between the lesser and greater tuberosities as it courses in a shallow groove on the anterior surface of the humerus. The long head tendon attaches to the scapula on the superior portion of the glenoid where its fibers merge with those of the fibrocartilaginous superior glenoid labrum.</p><p>The proximal humerus receives its blood supply from branches of the axillary artery. Two branches, the anterior and posterior humeral circumflex arteries, originate distal to the anatomic neck and travel proximally to supply the humeral head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71903\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71903 \">figure 6</a>). Thus, fractures occurring at the anatomic neck can disrupt the blood supply and result in osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) of the humeral head. The humeral shaft is supplied by the axillary and the brachial artery, which branches distally to become the radial and ulnar arteries. This vascular supply can be disrupted by a humeral shaft fracture if there is considerable displacement of fragments.</p><p>Proximity of the humerus to the axillary nerve and brachial plexus accounts for the risk of neurologic injury complicating humerus fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71903\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71903 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 \">figure 7</a>). Nerve injuries are more likely if there is a proximal humeral fracture that is significantly displaced or a concomitant humeral dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The axillary and suprascapular nerves are most often affected. Radial nerve injuries may occur with significant displacement of mid to distal shaft fractures. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal humerus fractures account for four to five percent of all fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and are the third most common fracture in elderly patients after those of the hip and distal radius. The incidence of proximal humerus fractures increases with age, with more than 70 percent occurring in patients over 60 years of age and the highest incidence among 73 to 78 year olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Proximal humerus fractures are three to four times more common in females than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The major risk factors are frequent falls and low bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In many older patients, proximal humerus fractures impair the ability to perform activities of daily living.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In elderly individuals, falls are the most common cause of proximal humerus fractures; approximately 87 to 93 percent of fractures occur after a fall from standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,7</a>]. Less often, these fractures occur from a direct blow or violent muscle contraction (eg, seizure). Anterior or posterior dislocations of the humeral head can occur in association with proximal humeral fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with proximal humeral fractures present with moderate to severe shoulder pain that increases with shoulder movement. Patients tend to hold the affected arm adducted against their side. Swelling and ecchymosis may be apparent shortly after injury. Gross shoulder deformities can occur, particularly if the fracture is associated with an anterior or posterior dislocation of the humeral head.</p><p>There are no specific examination tests for the diagnosis of proximal humeral fractures. Suspect this fracture in elderly patients who have fallen and present with the symptoms or findings described here. Although overlying musculature makes palpation difficult, patients typically have focal tenderness at the proximal humerus. </p><p>Distal pulses and nerve function must be evaluated, although assessment of motor function is often limited due to pain. Neurovascular injury occurs most often with displaced fractures or fracture-dislocations and usually involves the axillary or suprascapular nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Axillary nerve injury manifests as deltoid muscle weakness and diminished sensation over the mid-deltoid region. Suprascapular nerve injury can manifest as supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle weakness (ie, weakness with initiation of abduction and external shoulder rotation respectively). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the shoulder that include a true anteroposterior (AP) view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73366\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73366 \">image 1</a>), an axillary view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53879\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53879 \">image 2</a>), and a scapular-Y view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51351\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51351 \">image 3</a>) should be obtained if a proximal humeral fracture is suspected. This is the standard trauma series of radiographs. A Velpeau view, in which the patient's arm is held in internal rotation and the radiograph is oriented superior to inferior while the patient leans backward, is acceptable if an axillary view is unobtainable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71805\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71805 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p>A computed tomography (CT) scan with three-dimensional reconstructions is recommended if the trauma series of plain radiographs described above is non-diagnostic or if further information is necessary regarding the amount of displacement or rotation of a fracture fragment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. CT scans are also recommended for fracture dislocations, humeral head-splitting fractures, and comminuted fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of classification systems used to describe proximal humerus fractures. Given the complexity and variety of fracture patterns involved, it is not surprising that both inter-observer and intra-observer agreement for classification and treatment is relatively low, regardless of the imaging modality used or the experience of the physician. Of the many classification systems proposed for proximal humerus fractures, the AO and Neer classification schemes are used most often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Of these, the Neer system is used most often in the United States.</p><p>The AO classification system distinguishes three basic groups of fractures (and divides these into 27 subtypes): (A) extra-articular unifocal; (B) extra-articular bifocal; and, (C) articular. Type C fractures are considered to be higher risk due to the limited vascular supply to the articular segment and the increased risk of avascular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Neer classification scheme is based on the biomechanical forces involved and the resulting displacement patterns, and is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Neer classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Neer classification system is based upon the anatomical relationship of the four major segments of the proximal humerus: the anatomical neck, the surgical neck, the greater tuberosity, and the lesser tuberosity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67578\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67578 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66167\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66167 \">figure 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fractures are classified according to whether one or more of these four segments (or fragments) have been displaced. Displacement exists when a segment is angulated more than 45 degrees or displaced more than one centimeter from a normal anatomic position.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-part fractures are defined as fractures in which no fragments are displaced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64768\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64768 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-part fractures are defined by one displaced fragment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59038 \">image 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three-part fractures are defined by two displaced fragments but the humeral head remains in contact with the glenoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50923 \">image 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four-part fractures are defined by three or more displaced fragments and dislocation of the articular surface from the glenoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60812\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60812 \">image 7</a>).</p><p/><p>One and two-part fractures occur most commonly. Two-part fractures of the surgical neck are the most common displaced fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ORTHOPEDIC CONSULTATION OR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 80 percent of proximal humerus fractures are non-displaced or minimally displaced (ie, one-part) and can be treated conservatively by knowledgeable primary care clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, fractures of the anatomic neck have a high rate of subsequent osteonecrosis and patients with this type of fracture should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon even if there is no significant displacement of the fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Whether surgery is the best treatment for anatomic neck and other complex proximal humerus fractures remains a matter of debate. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fracture patterns'</a> above.)</p><p>A nonoperative approach to one-part fractures is supported by the findings of an observational study of 507 patients with minimally displaced humerus fractures treated conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At one-year follow up, 88 percent of patients had good or excellent results according to the Neer criteria; no patients developed a nonunion. Another study of 54 patients with one-part humerus fractures treated conservatively found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All patients had clinical union of the fracture and symptom scores at one year were similar to preinjury levels. Forward flexion was not diminished but there was a 2 to 7 degree loss of internal and external rotation.</p><p>Surgical intervention is generally needed for significantly displaced, multi-part fractures, and thus all displaced fractures should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation. Treatment options include minimally invasive osteosynthesis, percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal fixation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77998\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77998 \">image 8</a>), primary hemiarthroplasty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60512\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60512 \">image 9</a>), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Further indications for referral include fracture-dislocations and joint instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Emergency referral is indicated for all nerve and vascular injuries, open fractures, and fracture dislocations.</p><p>Three systematic reviews have assessed the outcomes of studies comparing conservative and surgical management of complex proximal humerus fractures and evaluating different surgical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. One systematic review suggests that patients with displaced fractures treated conservatively experience more pain and greater loss of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, other reviews and authors do not concur. A subsequent systematic review found that surgery does not result in better outcomes in patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the humeral neck, and often entails additional surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. All reviews determined that there is insufficient evidence from hiqh-quality randomized trials to determine which interventions are best for the management of different types of proximal humeral fractures. </p><p>In summary, we believe that patients with two to four-part proximal humerus fractures or those with anatomic neck fractures should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon to review treatment options, which are based upon the fracture type and patient characteristics.</p><p>Small, primarily observational studies suggest that good outcomes may be achieved in select patients using nonoperative management of displaced fractures, but further research is needed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study of 160 patients with humerus fractures treated conservatively showed that a majority had good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The study consisted of 75 one-part, 60 two-part, 23 three-part, and 2 four-part fractures. Immobilization averaged three weeks. The mean difference in Constant scores (an assessment of shoulder function) between the affected and unaffected side was 8.2 points (95% CI 7.3-13.1). The risk of delayed and nonunion was 7 percent and 41 of 42 employed patients returned to work. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 126 elderly patients with displaced two-part fractures treated conservatively reported that 64.5 percent achieved good or excellent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There was no correlation between fracture translation or angulation and the patient&rsquo;s ability to return to daily activities. At one-year follow up, no difference in shoulder function (using Neer scores) was found when these patients were compared to a cohort of surgically treated patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of patients with complex proximal humerus fractures, 40 patients (mean age 74) with three and four-part fractures were treated either with tension band wiring or nonoperative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At one year, no significant difference in pain, range of motion, abduction or flexion power, or the ability to perform activities of daily living was found between the two groups. Although the position of the fracture fragments improved in the operative group, this did not correlate with better function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The randomized PROFHER trial involving 250 patients with a displaced proximal humerus fracture reported no difference in overall shoulder function (as determined by the Oxford Shoulder Score [OSS]) at two and five year follow-up between patients treated surgically and those treated nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, a high proportion of patients (188) with clear indications for surgery were excluded from the trial, rendering the results difficult to interpret. The trial suggests that in a select group of patients without a clear indication for surgery, nonoperative management may be equivalent to surgery as determined by patient-important outcomes. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute treatment for one-part fractures includes immobilization in a standard sling or collar and cuff sling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68874 \">figure 10</a>). A standard sling is recommended for impacted fractures. A collar and cuff sling may aid in reduction of minimally displaced fragments. Swathes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78370\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78370 \">figure 11</a>) can be used for pain control but are otherwise not necessary unless the shoulder is unstable. Ice can be used to reduce pain and swelling; pain medications are generally necessary for the first week of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;, section on 'Upper extremity splints'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;, section on 'Pain management'</a>.)</p><p>Patients generally prefer to sleep semirecumbent (eg, in a reclining chair or propped up with pillows or a wedge in bed) with a sling. Repeat clinical evaluation and radiographs are performed at one week. Careful attention should be paid to the skin, especially in elderly patients with swelling and ecchymosis.</p><p>Several muscles have insertions on the proximal humerus and the forces exerted by these muscles make it difficult to maintain reductions of proximal humerus fractures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The supraspinatus and infraspinatus pull the greater tuberosity superiorly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subscapularis pulls the lesser tuberosity medially</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pectoralis major adducts the humeral shaft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The deltoid abducts the humeral shaft</p><p/><p>Therefore, closed reduction of fracture fragments is NOT recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total healing time is typically 6 to 12 weeks for proximal humerus fractures. Early callus formation usually occurs at four to six weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder rehabilitation is important after proximal humerus fractures; however, the optimal timing for the start of rehabilitation remains uncertain. Most experts agree that range of motion exercises should be initiated by two weeks but some argue this should occur sooner. The following clinical studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One prospective study assigned 85 patients to one or three weeks of immobilization, to be followed by rehabilitation with shoulder and other motion exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For the initial three months of treatment, shoulder function scores were better in patients who initiated motion at day seven. However, there was no difference in function between the two groups at 6, 12, and 24 months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar trial of 74 patients compared aggressive early mobilization at 72 hours to standard mobilization at three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Initially, Constant scores (assessment of shoulder function), pain scores, and mobility were better in the early mobilization group, but at six months no significant differences were noted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent study, 86 patients with two-part fractures of the proximal humerus were randomly assigned to begin range of motion exercises within the first week after injury or to continue shoulder immobilization for three weeks before beginning rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The group that started early therapy had significantly less pain and better function four months after the fractures occurred. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An uncontrolled study of 104 patients with minimally displaced (one-part) proximal humerus fractures found no difference in fracture healing but significantly better overall function and external rotation in those patients who started supervised physical therapy by day 14 compared with those who started after day 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The mean duration of follow up was 41 months.</p><p/><p>In summary, it appears that for patients with nondisplaced or minimally displaced one or two-part fractures, a shorter period of immobilization, perhaps as little as one week, does not adversely affect fracture healing and may be associated with better short term pain control and shoulder function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Reevaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are seen again within four to seven days of their initial visit and plain radiographs are obtained to reevaluate for significant displacement. If pain is well controlled and no displacement of fragments is noted, pendulum exercises can be initiated in the sling to avoid loss of shoulder motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72763 \">figure 12</a>). Passive elbow range of motion as well as isometric strengthening exercises for the biceps and triceps should be initiated early.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent visits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first of a series of two-week follow-up visits focuses on pain control and upper extremity range of motion. Patients are encouraged to discontinue their sling within two to four weeks of the injury, and to perform gentle, passive range of motion exercises of the elbow and shoulder. Pendulum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72763 \">figure 12</a>) and wall climb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58175\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58175 \">figure 13</a>) exercises should be done at least twice daily. If patients are unable to perform these exercises, a referral to physical therapy for assistance improving passive range of motion is necessary.</p><p>The goal of shoulder rehabilitation is to restore strength and mobility, including abduction, flexion, extension, and rotation. Exercises in which the patient places their hand on a wall or holds a ball against a wall to improve motion can begin within two to four weeks. Patients can initiate these motions against gravity at four weeks and progress to elastic band or resistance exercises once adequate motion has been achieved and there is sufficient evidence of healing by radiographs. The details of rehabilitation for proximal humeral fractures are beyond the scope of this monograph, but the systematic review cited here emphasizes the importance of early mobilization and outlines a program suitable for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>After eight weeks, the time between visits may be increased to every three to four weeks. The focus of these visits is to further improve shoulder range of motion and overall function. Functional measures of motion include the ability to touch the neck and lower back and to abduct the arm overhead. </p><p>Over subsequent weeks, the patient follows a progression of exercises designed to maximize shoulder mobility and strength. Most patients with nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures of the proximal humerus who adhere to a well-designed rehabilitation program regain over 90 percent of the function and 85 percent of the motion of their unaffected shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of shoulder mobility is among the more common complications of proximal humerus fractures. The decrease in motion ranges from the clinically insignificant to adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), in which shoulder movement is painful and limited in all orientations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-adhesive-capsulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Loss of shoulder motion and function is more likely to develop in patients who do not perform range of motion exercises during recovery. </p><p>Severely displaced or angulated fractures can cause neurovascular injury, most commonly to the circumflex artery and the axillary or suprascapular nerve. One prospective study of 142 patients with proximal humerus fractures found evidence of some denervation using an electromyogram in 67 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Injury to the axillary nerve accounted for 58 percent of cases, while injury to the suprascapular nerve accounted for 48 percent. All patients recovered full function of the nerve and muscles.</p><p>Proximal humerus fractures are sometimes associated with dislocations of the humeral head or rotator cuff tears, which can cause significant loss of motion or instability. Studies using dynamic ultrasound have found that 20 to 50 percent of patients with proximal humerus fractures have associated rotator cuff tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. A prospective study involving magnetic resonance imaging reported that 71 percent of patients had rotator cuff abnormalities and 40 percent had at least one torn or avulsed tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although osteonecrosis of the humeral head is not common, it can occur, especially in fractures involving the anatomic neck or severely displaced fractures. Other complications include nonunion and impingement from avulsed fracture fragments. A study of 160 patients managed nonoperatively reported delayed union or nonunion in seven percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3051038\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Return to work typically occurs two to three weeks after a proximal humerus fracture, provided the patient can return in the sling and the job does not require full use of the affected arm. Patients whose jobs include two-handed labor or lifting will likely not be able to return for 8 to 12 weeks.</p><p>Criteria for return to work include adequate range of motion and strength as well as stable callus formation on radiographs. The same criteria are used to determine the return to sports. Cardiovascular fitness after a proximal humeral fracture can be maintained by low impact activities such as walking or use of an elliptical trainer or stationary bike.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal humerus fractures account for four to five percent of all fractures and the incidence increases with advancing age. They often occur as a result of falling from a standing height. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling and ecchymosis may be apparent soon after the injury. Gross deformity of the shoulder suggests an associated anterior or posterior dislocation. Concomitant neurologic or vascular injury should be suspected and neurovascular integrity clinically assessed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Neer classification system is often used for proximal humerus fractures. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Neer classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex proximal humerus fractures (ie, Neer two-part to four-part fractures) and fractures that involve the anatomical neck should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. These are initially managed with immobilization using a standard sling, or if unstable a sling and swathe. Closed reduction of the fracture is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended prior to orthopedic referral.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 80 percent of proximal humerus fractures are impacted or nondisplaced (Neer one-part fractures) and are amenable to closed management. Orthopedic referral is not required for one-part fractures unless the fracture involves the anatomic neck, there are neurovascular complications, there is a concomitant shoulder dislocation, or the treating clinician is not experienced in fracture management. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonoperative management of one-part fractures includes initial immobilization with a standard or collar and cuff sling, ice, and analgesics. Neither splinting nor casting is required. We suggest that early mobilization with pendulum exercises be performed in the sling beginning one to two weeks after the injury. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodic follow-up visits allow assessment of range of motion, muscle strength, and function. Generally, the first appointment occurs one week following the injury, with subsequent follow up every two weeks for two months, followed by visits every three to four weeks until complete radiographic healing is documented. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Return to work can be expected in two to three weeks if the patient can perform the required duties while in a sling. Return to occupations that require full use of the shoulder or to sports is not advised until strength and range of motion are acceptable and stable healing is apparent on radiographs. (See <a href=\"#H3051038\" class=\"local\">'Return to sport or work'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Neer CS 2nd.
