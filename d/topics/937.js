Anesthetic challenges include abnormal airway anatomy and physiology, likely requirements for specialized endotracheal tubes for initial airway management and additional airway devices to meet evolving intraoperative needs, and changes to alternative modes of ventilation (eg, jet ventilation [JV], intermittent apneic oxygenation) if the trachea is open or obstructed.</p><p>This topic will discuss anesthetic management of adult patients undergoing surgery in the tracheal region from the distal edge of the larynx to the tracheal bifurcation at the carina.

The degree of airway patency may be dynamic and influenced by factors such as patient position, airway and thoracic muscle tone, mode of ventilation (spontaneous or controlled), or phase of respiration. A major goal of the preanesthetic evaluation is to determine whether the tracheal lesion could cause airway obstruction during induction of anesthesia, or subsequently during surgical manipulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resection.</p><p>Preanesthetic assessment includes the medical history, physical examination, functional status, and review of imaging studies that define pathology (eg, radiographs, bronchoscopies) and flow-volume loops (if available).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History</strong> &mdash; Determine what positions, breathing techniques, or other maneuvers improve or worsen breathing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination and functional status</strong> &mdash; Observe breathing at rest and, if possible, during mild exertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Determine whether increased work of breathing and dyspnea on exertion are present in patients with tracheal stenosis.

Inspiratory stridor is associated with at least a 50 percent reduction in diameter at the glottis or periglottis. Expiratory or biphasic stridor is associated with pathology well below the vocal cords. Such findings suggest critically narrowed central airways with risk of acute airway obstruction during induction of general anesthesia due to collapse, secretions, or minor airway swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Observe the breathing pattern relative to posture. Patients choose their resting position to optimize tracheal patency. See if the patient can assume a supine posture without increasing breathing difficulty.

If the patient complains of pain in the immediate postoperative period, we administer intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> (eg, 15 to 30 mg) with judiciously small doses of IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (eg, 25 to 50 mcg) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H88573057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H447934137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Fentanyl'</a>). IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> may also be used, if not administered in the preoperative period (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H88573095\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Intravenous acetaminophen'</a>). We avoid long-acting opioid agents since airway patency may be tenuous after tracheal surgery. </p><p>If a thoracotomy is required to accomplish the tracheal surgical procedure, postoperative pain management is similar to that for patients undergoing open pulmonary resection. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) or paravertebral block (PVB) analgesia are effective techniques that are used when feasible. Alternative analgesic techniques are offered if neither TEA nor PVB is appropriate, or if attempted preoperative placement of a TEA or PVB catheter is unsuccessful. These techniques are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H642462442\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Postoperative pain management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2142224542\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative team planning</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1084261806\"><span class=\"h3\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative communication with the surgery team and joint planning are necessary to avoid or immediately manage loss of airway patency or inability to ventilate and oxygenate the patient during induction or emergence from general anesthesia, as well as the possibility of airway fire. (See <a href=\"#H3802557714\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fire-safety-in-the-operating-room#H3052638557\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fire safety in the operating room&quot;, section on 'Fire in the airway'</a>.)</p><p>The anesthesiologist must also understand the proposed surgical procedure since surgical manipulation or resection of the trachea may cause airway obstruction. Inability to ventilate may also be caused by loss of airway continuity or patency during planned resection, unplanned injury to the trachea, or compression of airway structures. Preoperative planning is particularly important when the airway and surgical field will be shared or require close proximity between anesthesiologists and surgeons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative briefing &ndash; The preoperative briefing is typically performed with the aid of a checklist.

Examples include presence of excessive secretions or blood in the airway, vocal cord swelling noted after proximal tracheal manipulation or rigid bronchoscopy that necessitates pre-emergence administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 8 to 10 mg to reduce swelling, or anticipated complications due to an ill-fitting stent. During this final timeout, an immediate postoperative ventilation support plan is developed. This may include use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), establishment of positive pressure limits, criteria for endotracheal reintubation (and whether the anesthesiologist or the surgeon will attempt reintubation), or tracheostomy if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3480028104\"><span class=\"h3\">Key points for surgical briefings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following specific points are addressed during briefings and timeouts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussion of potential intraoperative need for modifications of the surgical plan and goals, aligned with dynamic management and sequential changes of airway devices and ventilation modes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishment of rescue plans if inability to ventilate occurs during induction or emergence from anesthesia, or due to intraoperative surgical interventions or complications.

The trachea is a dynamic and mobile structure that may change during ventilation or surgical interventions. Examples include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Length changes &ndash; The average tracheal length is 11.25 cm, and average external diameter is 20 mm for males (inner diameter [ID] 15 to 25 mm) and 15 mm for females (ID 10 to 21 mm). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Approximately 3 cm caudal excursion of the carina occurs with deep inspiration. This excursion may be observed as tracheal &quot;tugging&quot; when the elastic limits of elongation are reached, with additional downward pull during strained inspiratory efforts. After a tracheal repair with a fragile suture line, strained inspiratory efforts with resultant added tracheal tension should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Head or neck extension places cephalad pull on the trachea and can alter the length by a few centimeters, while flexion reduces tension on the trachea and pushes the extrathoracic trachea back into the mediastinum. This mobility may be used to facilitate optimal surgical exposure of the trachea or to reduce tension on suture lines if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In some cases, up to 50 percent of tracheal length is surgically resected. A laryngeal or hilar release may add 2 to 3 cm of additional tracheal length and mobility, thereby reducing tension on anastomotic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tracheal-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diameter changes &ndash; Diameter changes occur due to inward projection and encroachment on the membranous back wall of the trachea, while the cartilaginous portion of the trachea is not as significantly altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tracheal-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Tidal volume inhalation causes a 10 percent diameter increase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Forced exhalation and coughing result in a 30 percent diameter decrease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If tracheomalacia is present, high positive intrathoracic pressure (eg, during forced exhalation or coughing) may cause complete tracheal obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1597283673\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3196636425\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors are always employed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110080 \">table 1</a>).

Such neuromonitoring is particularly important if a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique is used to maintain anesthesia in a patient with a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter that cannot be seen after positioning of the surgical drapes, or if administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is planned. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

Also, ETTs are manufactured with variations in cuff volume, configuration, and location of the cuff endpoint relative to the tip of the ETT. Goals for selection of an appropriate ETT for a planned tracheal procedure include protection of the airway, reliable gas exchange, and provision of optimal surgical exposure. </p><p>Specific considerations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If laser use in or near the airway is planned, we select a laser-resistant ETT or jet ventilation (JV) catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tracheal-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

We use the only electronic JV system that is commercially available in the United States (the Monsoon III Jet Ventilator manufactured by Acutronic Medical Systems AG). This ventilator humidifies the gas and has sampling catheters that measure airway pressures within the JV catheter. To prevent pneumothorax, pressures exceeding the chosen limit cause an automatic suspension of ventilation that resumes when the pressure issue is resolved. Despite these precautions, not all patients will tolerate JV if their lung function and habitus are not favorable.

Critical decisions include timing of endotracheal intubation (preinduction [awake] versus postinduction [asleep]), selection of an intravenous (IV) versus inhalation induction technique, whether to use a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA), and timing for initiation of positive pressure ventilation (PPV). These decisions are based on the knowledge gleaned during the preoperative assessment and consultation with the surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H3797235438\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative assessment and planning'</a> above.)</p><p>For example, a tracheal or extrinsic mass effect may result in airway collapse and inability to achieve adequate mask ventilation as the ventilation mode shifts from spontaneous negative pressure breathing to applied PPV during induction of anesthesia. Administration of an NMBA may not improve or may worsen the clinician's ability to ventilate the patient. Since particular caution is necessary in any patient with tracheal pathology, the entire surgical, anesthesia, and nursing teams should be assembled, attentive, and ready to help execute the plan discussed in the preoperative briefing before induction of general anesthesia.

Thus, we do not administer intraoperative long-acting opioids for tracheal procedures that do not require a thoracotomy. (See <a href=\"#H14897888\" class=\"local\">'Planning for postoperative analgesia'</a> above.) </p><p>An NMBA may be necessary to facilitate portions of a tracheal procedure. Agent selection and timing of administration are challenging because dense muscle relaxation may be necessary and must be followed by reliable recovery. For example, brief periods of intense stimulation occur during laser surgery of the trachea or insertion of a rigid bronchoscope, but the duration of the surgical procedure is brief. For such cases expected to last &lt;20 minutes, we typically select a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> infusion, with care to avoid phase 2 blockade (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-anesthesia#H2517648691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Pharmacology of succinylcholine'</a>).

If rapid reversal of a relatively large dose of rocuronium is necessary when unexpected or abrupt termination of a surgical procedure occurs, then <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sugammadex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sugammadex</a> may be administered in doses up to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tracheal-surgery/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-anesthesia#H3132576103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Sugammadex'</a>). If sugammadex is not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisatracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisatracurium</a> is a good alternative to rocuronium because rapid reliable reversal of cisatracurium is possible with administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a>, even after minimal recovery of neuromuscular function.

If so, we typically extubate the anesthetized patient and immediately place a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) to facilitate this final bronchoscopy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H1605458047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Final bronchoscopy and emergence'</a>). After any tracheal procedure, communication between the surgeon and anesthesiologist is important to establish an airway support plan for the immediate postextubation period.

The anesthesiologist must ensure complete return of neuromuscular function after reversal of the NMBA, optimal respiratory mechanics (typically achieved by elevating the head of the bed approximately 30 degrees), and adequate spontaneous tidal volumes and respiratory rate (RR). Also, the patient must be conscious with the ability to protect the airway after extubation. Supplemental oxygen is administered before and after extubation to maintain adequate oxygenation.

Clear and interactive communication with the patient is essential, including ongoing reassurance. The surgeon should remain immediately available and the operating room team should keep equipment such as rigid bronchoscopes in the operating room for a patient with a potentially tenuous airway.</p><p>Prompt intervention is necessary if there are symptoms or signs of respiratory distress. Development of airway obstruction is more likely in a patient who had intraoperative airway bleeding or excessive secretions since even a small clot or mucous plug may compromise a narrowed airway. Notably, in patients with a tracheal stent, any drift in stent placement may result in acute malposition causing airway occlusion (see <a href=\"#H3728702848\" class=\"local\">'Insertion of an endotracheal stent or T-tube'</a> below).

In some cases, a decision to reschedule elective surgery is appropriate. </p><p>Depending on the goal of the bronchoscopic exam and patient's status, the anesthetic technique may involve topical and local anesthesia of the vocal cords and trachea, with optional sedation.

The flexible bronchoscope may be inserted through a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or endotracheal tube (ETT) that has an inner diameter (ID) &ge;7.5 mm. The breathing circuit from the anesthesia machine is attached to a side port on the bronchoscope. Adequate ventilation is usually achieved by ventilating around the scope after its passage through an adapter on the LMA or ETT.

It may then be necessary to administer high flows of oxygen and air to compensate for lost airway gases, with continuous monitoring of pulse oximetry and observation of chest rising to ensure adequacy of PPV and oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tracheal-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jet ventilation (JV) is accomplished via a purpose-built port that has a Luer-Lock connector for the JV tubing, or a catheter may be inserted directly into the rigid bronchoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68008\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68008 \">picture 1</a>).

The surgeon may opt to place an esophageal stent that at least partially isolates the TEF. Subsequent surgical repair of the esophagus and trachea or placement of a tracheal stent is accomplished after the distal airway has been suctioned and cleaned via a flexible bronchoscope and after maneuvers to facilitate alveolar recruitment have been initiated.</p><p>If the ETT is positioned beyond the fistula, it is pulled back intermittently to visualize the TEF during the surgical repair. PPV is avoided whenever the fistula is exposed; instead, intermittent apneic oxygenation is employed during these periods (see <a href=\"#H3998273655\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent apneic oxygenation'</a> above). Since inhalation anesthetic delivery and end-tidal measurements of exhaled concentration are unreliable during intermittent apnea, we employ a TIVA technique to ensure maintenance of adequate anesthetic depth.

The surgeon must be present. Other prerequisites for extubation are described above. (See <a href=\"#H2125727974\" class=\"local\">'Emergence and extubation'</a> above.)</p><p>Just before emergence, the surgeon may inspect and further clean the airway with a flexible bronchoscope inserted via the existing ETT or through an LMA that is placed at the end of the case. If an LMA is selected, bronchoscopic examination of the vocal cords can also be accomplished if there is any concern regarding vocal cord swelling or injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

(See <a href=\"#H1545800146\" class=\"local\">'Induction'</a> above.)</p><p>An endoscopic airway evaluation with flexible or rigid bronchoscopy, or both, is typically performed before surgical incision. A flexible bronchoscope may be inserted transorally with the patient awake or through an ETT or LMA with the patient asleep (see <a href=\"#H2415891036\" class=\"local\">'Flexible bronchoscopy before a tracheal procedure'</a> above). Immediately after anesthetic induction, the surgeon may insert a rigid bronchoscope to finalize the operative plan (see <a href=\"#H976956216\" class=\"local\">'Rigid bronchoscopy'</a> above). If the patient has critical stenosis of the airway, the surgeon may need to dilate the trachea using the rigid bronchoscope to allow subsequent passage of a 5.5 or 6.0 mm ETT though the stenotic area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420065009\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance and intraoperative airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically select a TIVA technique (eg, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>) and add a nondepolarizing NMBA to maintain anesthesia. Intermittent manipulation of the airway during surgery is highly stimulating, necessitating careful titration of the anesthetic agents used for a TIVA technique. (See <a href=\"#H43182421\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H7869294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>Once the trachea is exposed, all ignition sources (eg, the ESU) are removed from the surgical field for the duration of the case. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fire-safety-in-the-operating-room#H428134868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fire safety in the operating room&quot;, section on 'Oxygen during airway surgery'</a>.)</p><p>When the trachea is transected, the oral ETT is retracted so that the tip is just proximal to the transection. The surgeon then directly intubates the main conducting airway distal to the affected tracheal area and directly connects the ETT to sterile breathing circuit tubing (or jet ventilator tubing) on the surgical field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tracheal-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The proximal end of such tubing is passed over the surgical drapes to non-sterile extension tubing, which is immediately connected to the anesthesia machine or jet ventilator by the anesthesiologist. Subsequent ventilation is accomplished with well-timed breaths hand-delivered via this ETT, alternating with periods of intermittent apnea (see <a href=\"#H3998273655\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent apneic oxygenation'</a> above), or by jet ventilation (see <a href=\"#H1025987393\" class=\"local\">'Jet ventilation'</a> above). This cross-field ventilation technique ensures continued oxygenation and ventilation, potentially for a prolonged duration of time, while the trachea is being reconstructed. </p><p>After reconstruction of the trachea, the oral ETT is carefully readvanced through the new anastomosis. Circumferential tracheal sutures are then tightened so that controlled PPV may be employed without significant leaking. The repair is completed with the patient's head flexed and supported on blankets to reduce tension on the fresh tracheal suture lines. (See <a href=\"#H3480028104\" class=\"local\">'Key points for surgical briefings'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3776658796\"><span class=\"h3\">Emergence and extubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the repair is complete, the surgeon often repeats flexible bronchoscopy to inspect and clean the upper airway and trachea, either via the retracted ETT or through an LMA placed shortly before emergence.</p><p>Most patients undergoing tracheal resection and reconstruction are then allowed to emerge from general anesthesia with the ETT or LMA in place, with extubation awake in the operating room. Additional considerations for emergence and extubation are similar to those after repair of a TEF, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H4148837225\" class=\"local\">'Emergence and extubation'</a> above.)</p><p>Postoperative management is described below.

Postoperative pain is usually minimal and easily managed after a transverse cervical incision or closed tracheal procedure (see <a href=\"#H14897888\" class=\"local\">'Planning for postoperative analgesia'</a> above). After thoracotomy incision, either thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) or a paravertebral block (PVB) is typically employed to provide postoperative analgesia, as discussed separately.

Airway patency may be dynamic and influenced by factors such as patient position, tone of chest and airway muscles, mode of ventilation (spontaneous or controlled), or phase of respiration. Reevaluation is necessary on the day of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4291136048\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthetic consultation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1350986332\" class=\"local\">'Reevaluation on the day of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative communication with the surgery team with joint planning is necessary to avoid or immediately treat loss of airway patency or inadequate ventilation and oxygenation during induction of anesthesia, surgical manipulation or resection of the trachea, or emergence, as well as the possibility of airway fire. (See <a href=\"#H2142224542\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative team planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An array of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) and other airway devices (eg, laryngeal mask airways [LMAs], bronchial blockers, and airway exchange catheters) may be necessary during induction of anesthesia and subsequent surgical interventions. (See <a href=\"#H1564442815\" class=\"local\">'Endotracheal tube selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Specific considerations include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If laser use in or near the airway is planned, we select a laser-resistant ETT or jet ventilation (JV) catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a highly flexible crush-resistant tube is necessary to prevent kinking, we select a wire-reinforced &quot;armored&quot; ETT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If isolation of a distal portion of the lung is necessary, we select a double lumen tube (DLT), an extra-long ETT, or we create a long ETT with a small diameter by cutting the tracheal channel off a DLT or combining two ETTS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choice of technique for induction of general anesthesia is based on surgical needs and potential for compromised ventilation. Critical decisions include timing of endotracheal intubation (preinduction [awake] versus postinduction [asleep]), selection of an intravenous (IV) versus inhalation induction technique, whether to use a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA), and timing for initiation of positive pressure ventilation (PPV). (See <a href=\"#H1545800146\" class=\"local\">'Induction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">General concepts for the induction sequence include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there are no risks for airway collapse or compromise during induction, then either an IV or an inhalation induction technique may be selected.

Administration of an NMBA may be necessary to facilitate portions of a tracheal procedure.
