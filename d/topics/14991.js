In a study of 14,411 autopsies published in 1940, the incidence of renal infarction was 1.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a later series of almost 250,000 patients seen at an emergency department over four years, only 17 (0.007 percent) were diagnosed with acute renal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The frequency of renal infarction is probably higher than reported in the above studies since clinical diagnosis of renal infarction is frequently missed or delayed because the patients present with abdominal or flank pain that mimic other, more common conditions, such as nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>The two major causes of renal infarction are thromboemboli, which usually originate from a thrombus in the heart or aorta, and in-situ thrombosis, which may cause complete occlusion of the main renal artery or a segmental branch artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. The renal manifestations are <strong>different</strong> with atheroemboli, which, because they are typically nondistensible, irregularly shaped, and smaller in size, tend to produce incomplete arterial occlusion of more distal vessels, with secondary ischemic atrophy rather than renal infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of renal atheroemboli&quot;, section on 'Kidney injury'</a>.)</p><p>Thromboembolic renal infarction is reviewed here.

Bilateral renal involvement was present in 16.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>These findings may be accompanied by an acute elevation in blood pressure that is presumably mediated by increased renin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/1,7,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,20,21</a>]. Signs of extrarenal embolization (such as focal neurologic deficits and mesenteric and limb ischemia) can be seen.</p><p>Rarely, angiographic evidence of renal infarction is an incidental finding in patients with no prior history suggestive of such an event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following laboratory findings are typically seen in patients with acute renal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/1,3,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,18-22</a>].

As among patients with unilateral (ie, ureteral) obstruction, even complete obstruction may not result in a significant increase in the serum creatinine, providing the contralateral kidney is normal; however, among many patients with renal infarction who have a burden of underlying vascular disease, there may be a limited renal reserve such that even a limited infarction may cause an increase in creatinine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the series cited above, the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration was increased (mean 656 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> [range 152 to 7660]).

This pattern of enzyme elevation can also be seen in other conditions that are usually easily distinguishable from renal infarction, including late myocardial infarction, hemolysis, and renal transplant rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>Nonspecific findings included a mildly elevated white blood cell count (mean <span class=\"nowrap\">11,000/microL)</span> and an increase in serum C-reactive protein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the presenting symptoms of renal infarction are not unique, the time to diagnosis following presentation is often more than two days, with &lt;50 percent of patients being diagnosed promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/3,21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,24</a>].</p><p>In patients who are at risk for systemic embolization and present with symptoms suggestive of renal infarction, we recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis and urine culture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram to evaluate for atrial fibrillation</p><p/><p>Helical (spiral) computed tomography (CT) without contrast is usually the preferred initial test for flank pain since it is the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney and ureteral stones, which are much more common than renal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults#H1069381709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Noncontrast CT'</a>.)</p><p>If there is no evidence of stone disease on unenhanced helical CT, a contrast-enhanced CT scan should be performed to assess for renal infarction. The classic finding is a wedge-shaped perfusion defect. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium is an alternative to CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], although the use of gadolinium has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis among patients with significantly impaired renal function, and its use may be contraindicated among such patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>). A radioisotope scan may show a segmental or generalized decrease in renal perfusion. While radioisotope scans were commonly used in the past, their use has been largely supplanted by newer imaging techniques. Ultrasonography is much less sensitive.</p><p>The sensitivity of these imaging procedures was evaluated in a series of 44 patients with atrial fibrillation and a diagnosis of embolic renal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The sensitivity was 97 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(36/37)</span> with radioisotope renal scan, 80 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(12/15)</span> with contrast-enhanced CT, and only 11 percent with renal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two conditions that most closely mimic the clinical presentation of acute renal infarction are renal colic (flank pain and hematuria) and acute pyelonephritis (flank pain and fever). In a report of 14 patients, for example, eight had an admission diagnosis of nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, neither nephrolithiasis nor pyelonephritis is associated with an elevation in serum LDH, and the urinalysis in acute pyelonephritis typically reveals pyuria with or without white cell casts.</p><p>Other conditions that can mimic some of the features of renal infarction include mesenteric ischemia and other causes of abdominal pain, such as cholecystitis and pancreatitis. A history of atrial fibrillation or recent intra-arterial manipulation increases the likelihood of renal infarction or mesenteric ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for renal infarction due to thromboemboli, in situ thrombosis, or renal artery dissection is uncertain given the absence of comparative studies. Reported approaches include anticoagulation, endovascular therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">(thrombolysis/thrombectomy</span> with or without angioplasty), and open surgery.</p><p>For patients with acute renal artery occlusion involving the main renal artery or segmental branch that is diagnosed early (eg, less than one to two days from symptom onset) and in selected patients with persistent hypertension, we suggest percutaneous endovascular therapy (local thrombolysis, thrombectomy, or stent placement), unless contraindications exist, which are similar to fibrinolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68784\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68784 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>A small kidney on the affected side suggests that there has been prolonged ischemia and that collateral circulation may have formed, which will reduce the potential benefits of correcting the renal artery occlusion. Prolonged ischemia also reduces the likelihood that there will be viable tissue. Under these circumstances, revascularization may not be needed.</p><p>Many patients with acute renal infarction develop an elevation in blood pressure during the first week, which may subside over time, unless the patient has underlying hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Antihypertensive therapy is often required. Since increased renin release tends to play an important role, therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be effective. (See <a href=\"#H173081129\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most series of thromboembolic renal infarction have treated the majority of patients with anticoagulation, but many patients had a clear indication, such as atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/1-3,8,9,18,20,21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,8,9,18,20,21,27</a>]. The renal prognosis has generally been favorable, but there are no reports comparing outcomes with untreated patients. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Anticoagulation with intravenous heparin followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is the standard anticoagulation regimen in this setting. Heparin is typically discontinued when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable. The goal INR may vary with the cause of the renal infarction. The usual goal is 2 to 3. However, among patients with atrial fibrillation, a higher goal of 2.5 to 3.5 is reasonable if the event occurred while on adequate warfarin therapy or if the patients are at particularly high risk (eg, rheumatic heart disease, prosthetic heart valves). In the patient with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are generally preferred over warfarin. The presence of renal insufficiency needs to be taken into account when deciding on the choice of anticoagulant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H124798703\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Clinical use of anticoagulants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H9066197\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thromboembolic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Benefits and risks of oral antithrombotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Anticoagulation is clearly indicated when warranted by the underlying disease (eg, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombus, or a hypercoagulable state) but not in a number of other settings, such as tumor or fat embolization or aortic dissection. The primary aim of anticoagulation is to prevent future events. The role of prophylactic anticoagulation in the absence of a hypercoagulable state or an embolic source is less certain. If there are no contraindications, we generally anticoagulate such patients with intravenous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by continued low-molecular-weight heparin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for three to six months, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> indefinitely. The treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is addressed elsewhere.

Later therapy is likely to be effective only in patients with incomplete occlusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Angioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with renal infarction caused by an intrinsic abnormality of renal vessels, such as dissection, angioplasty with stent placement was associated with the improvement of blood pressure in a small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the reported experience with surgery for renal infarction has been in patients with traumatic renal artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>], although surgery has also been performed for embolic renal artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/37,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40,41</a>].</p><p>There are no data comparing surgery with anticoagulation, local thrombolytic therapy, or catheter thrombectomy. Most of the studies are old, and data summarizing experience from 1970 to 1982 noted an operative mortality rate of 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Based upon such observations, there seems to be <strong>little indication</strong> for primary surgical therapy in the current era, particularly in patients with two functioning kidneys and unilateral disease. A possible exception is the trauma patient, in whom surgery is indicated for other reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis following a renal infarction (treated or untreated) is not well defined. Renal infarction primarily occurs in patients who have other conditions associated with morbidity and mortality (eg, atrial fibrillation, diffuse atherosclerotic disease), and patients with renal emboli may have embolization to other organs, such as the brain and intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/2,3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,21</a>]. In a review of 44 cases of renal infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation, the mortality rate was 11.4 percent in the first month after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In most studies, serum creatinine was stable or only slightly increased at follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/1-3,7,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,7,20,21</a>]. This is not surprising, since only one kidney is usually affected and since, in the absence of further insults, compensatory hypertrophy in the other kidney (or unaffected portions of the ipsilateral kidney) may limit the long-term reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). New-onset hypertension may resolve spontaneously, but some patients have persistent renin-mediated hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Long-term outcomes were perhaps best described in the series of 44 patients with atrial fibrillation: 38 were treated with heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (seven also received intra-arterial thrombolysis and one also underwent angioplasty), and six did not receive anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At a mean follow-up of three years, the following outcomes were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixty-one percent of patients had normal renal function; 13 percent had mild renal impairment (serum creatinine 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [133 to 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]);</span> 18 percent had a serum creatinine &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L);</span> and 8 percent were being treated with maintenance dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five patients died during the first month after diagnosis (including patients on dialysis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat thromboembolic events occurred in 11 patients (13 percent).</p><p/><p>The time to diagnosis may be a determinant of renal outcomes. In a study of 22 patients with documented segmental renal infarction, patients who were diagnosed early (mean time to diagnosis 76 hours) had a nonsignificant trend toward better renal outcomes compared with those who were diagnosed late (mean time to diagnosis 126 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pre-existing GFR and lack of pre-infarct anticoagulation were also predictive of persistent renal dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1404646530\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Renal infarction may also result from a hypercoagulable state. Often, no underlying cause is found. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of acute renal arterial occlusion include flank pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting, fever, and sometimes an acute elevation in blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients suspected of having renal infarction, we recommend obtaining the following tests (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>White blood cell count, serum creatinine concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferases, urinalysis, urine culture, and electrocardiogram (to assess for atrial fibrillation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A noncontrast spiral computed tomography (CT) to exclude nephrolithiasis and, if negative, a contrast-enhanced spiral CT to evaluate for infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using gadolinium may also be used, although the use of gadolinium has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis among patients with significantly impaired renal function, and its use may be contraindicated among such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment for renal infarction due to clot emboli or renal artery thrombosis is uncertain. However, limited reported experience suggests that the following approach is reasonable:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients should be treated with anticoagulation with heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> when warranted by the underlying disease (eg, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombus, or a hypercoagulable state) to prevent future events. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with acute renal artery occlusion involving the main renal artery or segmental branch that is diagnosed early (eg, less than one to two days from symptom onset) and in selected patients with persistent hypertension, we suggest percutaneous endovascular therapy (local thrombolysis, thrombectomy, or stent replacement), unless contraindications exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68784\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68784 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Thrombolysis and thrombectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There seems to be little indication for primary surgical therapy in the current era, particularly in patients with two functioning kidneys and unilateral disease. A possible exception is the trauma patient in whom surgery is indicated for other reasons. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with hypertension should be treated with antihypertensive agents. As in other forms of renovascular disease, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) should be part of the therapeutic regimen.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bourgault M, Grimbert P, Verret C, et al.
