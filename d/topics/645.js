Adequate patient tolerance is essential for successful completion of a safe examination and compliance with subsequent follow-up. As a result, endoscopists have developed skills in administering a variety of sedative and analgesic agents to facilitate procedures and enhance patient comfort.</p><p>Most of the attention has been placed on selecting the optimal regimen for producing procedural sedation and monitoring patients adequately during the procedures. Many procedures are performed using intravenous benzodiazepines and opiates (previously referred to as intravenous conscious sedation), which typically result in moderate degrees of sedation. There have been attempts to determine which patients and procedures require deeper sedation. In addition, there has been an effort to make some diagnostic procedures more tolerable to avoid the cost and risk of procedural sedation altogether.</p><p>Endoscopists occasionally encounter individuals who are difficult to adequately sedate for endoscopy using standard agents. In addition, certain therapeutic endoscopic procedures require deeper levels of sedation. There are multiple options in these settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> to standard procedural sedation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation</p><p/><p>This topic will review the use of these alternative and adjunctive approaches for sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Diphenhydramine is often used for patients who may not adequately respond to standard procedural sedation, such as those who use benzodiazepines or opiates chronically. Typically, 25 to 50 mg of diphenhydramine is given intravenously prior to or concurrent with starting procedural sedation.</p><p>Side effects associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> include dizziness, blurred vision, dry mouth, epigastric discomfort, thickening of bronchial secretions, and urinary retention.

Patients in the diphenhydramine group had a 10 percent reduction in meperidine use and a 14 percent reduction in midazolam use. In addition, more favorable patient scores for overall sedation and pain were seen in the diphenhydramine group.

Eighty patients were assigned to receive either PCS with propofol and remifentanil or anesthesiologist-managed propofol sedation. Patients in the PCS arm received less propofol and were not as deeply sedated as patients in the anesthesiologist managed arm.

Reversal is only possible by stopping the medication and maintaining ventilation until the medication effect elapses. Propofol also inhibits an individual's protective airway reflex; as a result, whenever propofol is administered, the person responsible for managing the sedation must be fully trained and capable of protecting the airway. For these reasons, the use of propofol has been limited to anesthesiologists in most centers in the United States. On the other hand, there is growing experience and literature establishing outstanding safety data for the administration of propofol-based sedation by non-anesthesiologist nurses and clinicians highly trained in airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/43,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,50-53</a>].</p><p>In a study looking at 646,080 endoscopic cases performed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> administered by non-anesthesiologist nurses and clinicians, there were only four deaths, with bag-mask ventilation being required in 0.1 percent of upper endoscopies and 0.01 percent of colonoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, much of this experience has been with use during routine endoscopy in low-risk patients. Whether administration of propofol by non-anesthesiologists is appropriate in older adults or in patients with comorbidities such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, heart failure, or potentially difficult airway anatomy requires additional study.

The indications for general anesthesia in this series were failed previous attempts at examination using procedural sedation, mental retardation, simultaneous procedures with another procedure requiring anesthesia, and an expected long, difficult examination. Scheduling difficulties, cost considerations, concern about airway trauma, and anesthetic-related adverse events all contribute to the reluctance to use general anesthesia, even in children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During a two-year period at four teaching hospitals, 65 of 1200 patients undergoing ERCP (5.4 percent) received general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, and data were available for analysis for 63 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Seven of these were children. Fifty-three of the remaining 56 evaluated had failed one or more prior attempted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using procedural sedation. Forty-eight percent of those with failed prior attempts were current abusers of alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drugs. Significantly more substance abusers failed ERCP under procedural sedation compared with non-substance abusers (30 versus 2 percent). Other reasons for general anesthesia included prior failed procedure attempts due to agitation in patients who were not substance abusers, adverse reactions to prior procedural sedation, septic shock, and myasthenia gravis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This study underscores the fact that adults who required general anesthesia for ERCP had characteristics that were generally considered to be risk factors for difficult sedation (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patients who are likely to be difficult to sedate'</a> above). This supports the conclusion that these patient-related factors are important considerations in choosing the sedation regimen. However, no prospective or good retrospective analyses have been published to confirm which patient characteristics are significant predictors of inadequate sedation with standard medications alone.</p><p/><p>In adults, general anesthesia is usually the technique of last resort with a few major exceptions.
