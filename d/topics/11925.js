The first outbreak was described in Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Illness due to norovirus was initially described as &quot;winter vomiting disease&quot; due to its seasonal predilection and preponderance of patients with vomiting as a primary symptom.</p><p>The epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and prevention of norovirus will be reviewed here. Issues related to management of acute viral gastroenteritis in adults are discussed separately.

Each year, norovirus causes 19 to 21 million illnesses, including 570 to 800 deaths, 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations, 400,000 emergency department visits, and 1.7 to 1.9 million outpatient visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Norovirus antibody seroprevalence rises progressively during childhood; more than 90 percent of young adults are seropositive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17</a>]. However, immunity is not long lasting, and reinfection can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Exposure over time to a diversity of norovirus strains may result in repeat infections.</p><p>Norovirus infection can be acquired at any time of year; some studies in temperate climates have noted a peak in incidence during the winter months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1708445660\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Person-to-person transmission of norovirus occurs via the fecal-oral route, with an incubation period of 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A small inoculum (&lt;100 viral particles) is required for transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Norovirus shedding in stool is maximal over the first 24 to 48 hours after illness; the mean duration of viral shedding is four weeks after onset of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/16,24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24-30</a>]. In immunocompromised hosts, viral shedding in stool can persist for months following infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31</a>].</p><p>Spread of norovirus infection can also occur via airborne droplets of vomitus containing viral particles, fomite contamination, or consumption of contaminated food and water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/21,32-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,32-39</a>].</p><p>Norovirus is extremely stable in the environment; it resists freezing temperatures, heating to 60&ordm;C, and disinfection with chlorine or alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Norovirus transmission occurs more frequently among symptomatic patients than asymptomatic shedders, and nosocomial transmission is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H484132535\"><span class=\"h2\">Outbreaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Norovirus outbreaks have occurred in the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/1,4,10,43-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,10,43-49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restaurants and catered events</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitals and long-term care facilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Schools, child care settings, and community centers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Municipal water contamination and recreational water exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cruise ships and resorts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Military populations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athletic teams</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural disasters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prisons</p><p/><p>Among more than 2000 foodborne outbreaks with a single suspected or confirmed cause reported in the United States between 2009 and 2012, 48 percent were caused by norovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Foods associated with transmission include shellfish, salads, sandwiches, frosting, and produce items such as celery, melon, and raspberries. Of 1008 foodborne outbreaks of norovirus, specific food categories were implicated in only 67 outbreaks; the most frequently identified foods were leafy vegetables (30 percent), fruits (21 percent), and molluscs (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Two or more similar illnesses resulting from a common exposure should raise suspicion for a norovirus outbreak and prompt involvement of public health officials for laboratory testing and epidemiologic investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Criteria that should raise suspicion for an outbreak caused by norovirus include average incubation period 24 to 48 hours, average duration of illness 12 to 60 hours, presence of vomiting in more than half of cases, and stool cultures negative for bacterial pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. These criteria (known as &quot;Kaplan criteria&quot;) have been found to have high specificity and moderate sensitivity for differentiating norovirus from bacterial causes of diarrhea (99 and 68 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Outbreaks of norovirus can be difficult to contain given the small inoculum required for transmission and its environmental stability. In the United States, outbreaks should be reported to public health authorities and to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2837488440\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Norovirus</em> is a genus within the Caliciviridae family of small nonenveloped RNA viruses, which also includes <em>Sapovirus</em>. The <em>Norovirus</em> and <em>Sapovirus</em> genera contain the human enteric viruses of the same names as well as a number of viruses that cause enteric diseases in other animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Noroviruses are subdivided into at least seven genogroups based upon sequence homology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Genogroups GI, GII, and GIV include human pathogens; multiple genotypes are recognized within each genogroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Frequent recombination between strains contributes to rapid changes in genetic diversity; many recombinants are as infectious and virulent as prototype strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. The illnesses caused by viruses in each genogroup are clinically indistinguishable despite differences in genetic sequence, genomic recombination between strains, and receptor-binding characteristics.</p><p>The most common cause of human norovirus infection is GII (mostly GII.4) followed by GI and GIV. GII.4 viruses have been associated with epidemic infection and more severe outcomes than other norovirus genotypes, including higher hospitalization and death rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/44,61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,61-64</a>].</p><p>Two GII.4 variants were responsible for outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand from 2005 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Subsequently, one of these strains was linked to approximately one-fourth of the outbreaks reported in the United Kingdom. In 2012, GII.4 Sydney strain (named for the location in Australia where it was first isolated) replaced GII.4 New Orleans as the predominant strain in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The proportion of outbreaks attributed to this new strain increased from 19 to 58 percent between September and December 2012. Prior GII infection appears to protect against subsequent infection, which has important significance for vaccine development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. GII.4 genotypes remain predominant in the United States and most of the world.</p><p>In 2014, a GII.17 variant emerged in Japan and has spread worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. Its clinical presentation is indistinguishable from that of previously predominating strains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3860055761\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2618176319\"><span class=\"h2\">Host susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood group antigens have been linked to host susceptibility to norovirus infection; such antigens may serve as receptors or cofactors for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>The blood group antigens recognized vary by virus genogroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-76</a>]. It has been suggested that genogroup GI viruses may bind preferentially to blood group A and O antigens, while genogroup GII viruses may bind preferentially to blood group A and B antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>However, in contrast with the above observations, a study of two norovirus outbreaks among Israeli military recruits noted no association between genogroup GII norovirus infection and ABO blood group antigens, suggesting that GII viruses are capable of infecting individuals regardless of blood type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>Individual norovirus strains may be capable of infecting only a subset of the human population; however, given the diverse binding profiles found among the norovirus genogroups, nearly all individuals are likely susceptible to infection. In addition, recurrent infection can occur given the diversity of norovirus strains and the lack of cross-strain or long-term immunity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1606311183\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea induced by norovirus is associated with transient malabsorption of D-xylose and fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>] and with decreased activity of brush-border enzymes including alkaline phosphatase and trehalase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Absorption and brush-border enzyme levels return to normal values within two weeks after infection.</p><p>The mechanisms of norovirus-induced vomiting and diarrhea are uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Gastric emptying is markedly delayed in normal adults challenged with norovirus, but the degree of delay is not correlated with the severity of vomiting, and norovirus infection has not been associated with detectable enterotoxin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Acute norovirus infection produces a reversible histopathologic lesion in the jejunum, with apparent sparing of the stomach and rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/80,83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,83-86</a>]. The villi are blunted, but the mucosa is otherwise intact. Mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrations are seen in the lamina propria. On electron microscopy, the epithelial cells are intact, microvilli are shortened, and the intercellular spaces are widened.</p><p>These histopathologic changes appear within 24 hours after virus challenge (whether symptomatic or subclinical), are present at the peak of illness, and persist for a variable period of time after the illness. They generally clear within two weeks after the onset of illness, although some jejunal changes have been noted as late as six weeks after challenge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Norovirus infection produces a spectrum of clinical manifestations, from mild illness with fever and watery diarrhea to more severe illness with fever, vomiting, headache, and constitutional symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/18,29,87-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29,87-90</a>]. Asymptomatic infection also occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452223041\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period is generally 24 to 48 hours (range 12 to 72 hours), and onset of symptoms is typically abrupt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Symptoms typically last for 48 to 72 hours with rapid recovery. Norovirus shedding in stool is maximal over the first 24 to 48 hours after illness; the mean duration of viral shedding is four weeks after onset of illness. In immunocompromised hosts, viral shedding in stool can persist for months following infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/16,24-28,31,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24-28,31,67</a>].</p><p>Symptoms include nausea and vomiting (nonbloody, nonbilious), watery diarrhea (nonbloody), and abdominal pain. Vomiting is more prominent in the setting of norovirus infection than in gastroenteritis caused by other viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If diarrhea is present, it is generally moderate (approximately four to eight stools over a period of 24 hours). Stools lack mucous, and fecal leukocytes are not seen.</p><p>Generalized myalgias, malaise, and headache are prominent. Fever occurs in approximately half of cases. In general, patients are uncomfortable but usually do not appear severely ill, although severe dehydration can occur.</p><p>The white blood cell count is generally normal or may be slightly elevated; relative lymphopenia may be observed at the height of the illness. Renal function is generally normal unless dehydration ensues.</p><p>Severe manifestations have been observed among older adults, children &lt;12 months, and among immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/4,91-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,91-95</a>]. In patients with severe disease, fever occurs more commonly and illness may last several days longer than in healthy individuals.</p><p>Individuals with leukemia, lymphoma, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, or graft-versus-host disease may have profuse and prolonged watery diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>]. Among transplant patients, norovirus infection has been associated with histopathologic changes such as disorganization and flattening of the intestinal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Stool shedding may occur for several months among immunocompromised individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>].</p><p>Postinfectious sequelae may include dyspepsia, constipation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Rarely, central nervous system manifestations including seizures and encephalopathy have been reported in association with norovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/1,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3079085643\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stool shedding of norovirus infection in asymptomatic individuals is common, especially in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study including 2200 asymptomatic individuals, the prevalence of asymptomatic norovirus infection was 12 percent; the prevalence was highest among children &lt;5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Asymptomatic shedding of norovirus has diagnostic implications, since diarrhea due to another cause in an asymptomatic carrier may be misattributed to norovirus infection. In addition, asymptomatic shedding has epidemiologic implications; as an example, asymptomatic food handlers may transmit infection to others.</p><p>Asymptomatic infection may be attributable to variability in the host immune response <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> variation in expression of viral genome transcription factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18807986\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of norovirus infection should be suspected in patients with vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea with duration of illness 48 to 72 hours. Norovirus is usually diagnosed clinically; laboratory testing is not performed routinely in hospitals or clinics. Other causes of gastroenteritis are discussed further separately.

Two or more similar illnesses resulting from a common exposure should raise suspicion for a norovirus outbreak and prompt involvement of public health officials for laboratory testing and epidemiologic investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Epidemiologic criteria for identifying outbreaks of gastroenteritis due to norovirus are described above. (See <a href=\"#H484132535\" class=\"local\">'Outbreaks'</a> above.)</p><p>Laboratory testing may also be useful for immunocompromised hosts with severe or persistent symptoms to guide decisions regarding interventions that are unlikely be beneficial (such as empiric antimicrobial therapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18807951\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory tools for detection of norovirus include genomic amplification via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen detection via enzyme immunoassays.</p><p>Stool RT-PCR is the mainstay of laboratory diagnosis; noroviruses and other viral causes of gastroenteritis are readily detectable with this tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/106-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">106-110</a>]. Carefully selected primers within divergent capsid regions can be used for genotypic differentiation of viral strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. PCR techniques are also used widely for viral detection in food and environmental samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/73,75,112-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75,112-115</a>]. Viral detection by RT-PCR in stool may be limited by low virus concentration, improper specimen storage, inefficient viral RNA extraction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> presence of reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Interpretation of a positive RT-PCR or immunoassay in a patient with acute diarrhea may be difficult, since asymptomatic shedding is common and RT-PCR can detect a low viral load (&lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">particles/gram),</span> which may not necessarily establish norovirus as the etiology of illness. Diagnostic tests for noroviruses must be interpreted together with epidemiologic and clinical factors.</p><p>A number of antigen-detection enzyme immunoassays have been developed; these assays have lower sensitivity and specificity than RT-PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/116-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-121</a>]. Their utility is limited for diagnosis of sporadic cases of gastroenteritis, but they can be useful in outbreak settings for which multiple samples are available for testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/norovirus/abstract/118,122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,122-124</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18807464\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of norovirus infection includes other causes of viral gastroenteritis as well as other causes (infectious and noninfectious) of gastrointestinal symptoms.

Norovirus infection can be acquired at any time of year; some studies in temperate climates have noted a peak in incidence during the winter months. (See <a href=\"#H1936088924\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Person-to-person transmission of norovirus infection occurs via the fecal-oral route, via airborne droplets of vomitus containing viral particles, fomite contamination, or consumption of contaminated food and water. Outbreaks of norovirus can be difficult to contain given the small inoculum required for transmission (&lt;100 viral particles) and the ability of the virus to survive in the environment; it resists freezing temperatures, heating to 60&ordm;C, and disinfection with chlorine or alcohol. (See <a href=\"#H1708445660\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of human norovirus infection is GII (mostly GII.4) followed by GI and GIV. GII.4 viruses have been associated with epidemic infection and more severe outcomes than other norovirus genotypes, including higher hospitalization and death rates. (See <a href=\"#H2837488440\" class=\"local\">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incubation period of norovirus infection is generally 24 to 48 hours (range 12 to 72 hours), and onset of symptoms is typically abrupt. Symptoms typically last for 48 to 72 hours with rapid recovery. Norovirus shedding in stool is maximal over the first 24 to 48 hours after illness; the mean duration of viral shedding (detected via polymerase chain reaction) is four weeks after onset of illness. In immunocompromised hosts, viral shedding in stool can persist for months following infection. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of norovirus infection include nausea and vomiting (nonbloody, nonbilious), watery diarrhea (nonbloody), and abdominal pain. Vomiting is more prominent in the setting of norovirus infection than in gastroenteritis caused by other viruses. If diarrhea is present, it is generally moderate. Generalized myalgias, malaise, and headache are prominent. Fever occurs in approximately half of cases. In general, patients are uncomfortable but usually do not appear severely ill, although dehydration can occur. Severe manifestations have been observed among older adults, children &lt;12 months, and among immunocompromised patients. Asymptomatic norovirus infection also occurs and can be associated with transmission. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of norovirus infection should be suspected in patients with vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea with duration of illness 48 to 72 hours. Norovirus is usually diagnosed clinically; laboratory testing is not performed routinely in hospitals or clinics. Other causes of gastroenteritis are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Norovirus laboratory testing is used by public health laboratories for outbreak detection and to monitor the success of interventions to interrupt transmission. Two or more similar illnesses resulting from a common exposure should raise suspicion for a norovirus outbreak and prompt involvement of public health officials for laboratory testing and epidemiologic investigation. Criteria that should raise suspicion for an outbreak caused by norovirus include average incubation period 24 to 48 hours, average duration of illness 12 to 60 hours, presence of vomiting in more than half of cases, and stool cultures negative for bacterial pathogens. (See <a href=\"#H484132535\" class=\"local\">'Outbreaks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical management of norovirus infection is as described for other types of viral gastroenteritis; this is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults#H752813325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral gastroenteritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Norovirus is not killed by alcohol or standard cleaning agents. Therefore, hand hygiene for caretakers of patients with gastroenteritis should consist of washing hands with soap and water (rather than use of alcohol-based hand disinfection), and contaminated environmental surfaces should be disinfected with bleach. In addition, individuals with norovirus infection should not prepare food for others until at least two days after resolution of symptoms.
