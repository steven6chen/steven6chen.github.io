The cutaneous manifestations of DM may also develop in the absence of detectable muscle disease and can persist after the successful treatment of DM-associated myositis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Skin lesions of DM are often resistant to photoprotection and topical therapies alone, necessitating the initiation of systemic therapy. Patients who fail to respond to antimalarials and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, or who relapse during therapy with these agents, require more aggressive immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs.

Pruritus associated with DM can be severe, leading to significant detrimental effects on patient quality of life.

Because many patients fail to improve adequately with photoprotection, antipruritics, and topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors, the addition of systemic antimalarials or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> is often necessary. Patients who fail to respond to these conventional interventions or who relapse after an initial response have refractory disease and require the initiation of more aggressive therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults#H13069029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of cutaneous dermatomyositis in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Calcinosis cutis is a cutaneous complication of DM that also can be refractory to treatment.

Selection of these agents is based upon evidence that suggests efficacy and the knowledge that these are generally well-tolerated therapies. Although comparative studies have not been performed, clinicians with expertise in DM generally consider IVIG the most effective treatment and treatment of choice. However, the need for intravenous administration and the high cost of IVIG limit use of this agent in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H19331646\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3360676949\" class=\"local\">'Mycophenolate mofetil'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional treatments for refractory cutaneous DM include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, and systemic immunosuppressants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Due to limited or conflicting evidence in support of the efficacy of these agents and the risks for adverse effects associated with many of these drugs, we generally reserve the use of these agents for patients who have failed or who are poor candidates for IVIG and MMF. The need for treatment of concomitant refractory muscle disease can also influence the choice of therapy.

Clinical improvement is expected within two to three cycles. Given the high cost of IVIG, the interval between treatments is typically progressively lengthened once the patient has achieved a complete or near complete clinical response (eg, to every five weeks, then every six weeks, etc). Relapse may occur upon treatment discontinuation; continued treatment may be necessary to maintain improvement.</p><p>If patients do not have a substantial response within three months, IVIG is unlikely to be effective, and patients should be transitioned to other treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3653229753\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvement in cutaneous DM was reported in a randomized trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG for muscle disease in DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this trial, IVIG was added to the treatment regimens of 15 patients with myositis and cutaneous DM who had failed to improve with immunosuppressive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients were given IVIG (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> or placebo once monthly for three consecutive months and had the option to cross over to the alternative therapy after the initial treatment period. Marked improvement in skin disease (assessed through clinical photographs) occurred in 8 out of 12 patients treated with IVIG in either the initial or crossover phase. Improvements in cutaneous disease preceded or coincided with muscle improvement, which was evident approximately 15 days after the first infusion of IVIG and peaked between the second and third infusions. The effect of placebo treatment on skin disease was not reported.</p><p>Retrospective studies, case reports, and case series offer additional support for the use of IVIG in refractory DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Benefit from low-dose IVIG has been reported; in one woman with cutaneous manifestations of DM refractory to systemic glucocorticoids, five-day courses of IVIG (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) given twice over the course of two weeks led to clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2345615\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects of IVIG include hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, vasculitis, aseptic meningitis, renal failure, myocardial infarction, and thrombosis.

The dependency of T and B lymphocytes on this pathway for the production of DNA and RNA is responsible for the selective immunosuppressive properties of MMF. MMF is used for the treatment of myositis in DM, and the drug also appears to be beneficial for skin disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-recurrent-and-resistant-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults#H3169810404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of recurrent and resistant dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;, section on 'Mycophenolate mofetil'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2277056344\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MMF is typically given as 2 to 3 g per day in two divided doses. Patients are typically started on 500 mg twice daily for two weeks, followed by laboratory tests and clinical assessment to confirm tolerance of the medication. The dose is then titrated to 1 g given twice daily and, if tolerated, to 1.5 g twice daily in many patients. Improvement in skin disease is expected within two to three months of treatment. If the response is poor after three months, we transition patients to other treatments. &#160;</p><p>Given the relatively slow onset of action of MMF, overlapping treatment may reduce the risk for disease flares while awaiting the drug's onset of action and during titration of the MMF. In patients who are transitioning from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> to MMF due to an inadequate response to methotrexate, we often continue methotrexate at a reduced dose (usually 10 to 15 mg per week) for several weeks to several months after starting MMF. Lowering the dose of methotrexate is intended to reduce cumulative immunosuppressive effects. In most patients, we taper and eventually discontinue methotrexate once clinical improvement is noted. However, in patients with particularly refractory disease, we may continue 10 to 15 mg per week of methotrexate in conjunction with MMF, with close monitoring for laboratory abnormalities and for infection.
