The yersinioses are zoonotic infections of domestic and wild animals; humans are considered incidental hosts that do not contribute to the natural disease cycle. </p><p><em>Y. enterocolitica</em> and <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> cause yersiniosis, a diarrheal illness; human infection with <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> is much more common than human infection with <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em>. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of these infections will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of these infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-yersiniosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of yersiniosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-yersinia-enterocolitica-and-yersinia-pseudotuberculosis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p><em>Y. pestis</em> causes plague and is discussed separately.

A variety of complications (both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal) and post-infectious sequelae have also been described, as outlined in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89479838\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute yersiniosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period for yersiniosis is typically 4 to 6 days (range 1 to 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>Clinical manifestations of acute yersiniosis include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever; nausea and vomiting may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The onset of <em>Yersinia </em>gastroenteritis can be more subacute than other diarrheal pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In a Norwegian study including 67 cases of sporadic yersiniosis, an average of more than a week elapsed before patients sought medical care and almost two weeks elapsed before a stool culture was obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The median duration of diarrhea for yersiniosis can also be longer than for other causes of acute gastroenteritis. In five case series, the duration ranged from 12 to 22 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73764 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Prolonged illnesses were observed in each case series, and some patients reported persistent diarrhea or abdominal pain up to a year following acute illness. Nevertheless, yersiniosis cannot be readily distinguished clinically from other causes of acute diarrhea. In some circumstances, localization of abdominal pain to the right lower quadrant may be a diagnostic clue for yersiniosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H89479916\" class=\"local\">'Pseudoappendicitis'</a> below.) </p><p>Pharyngitis may be an accompanying presenting symptom. Sore throat was reported by up to 20 percent of patients in some case series (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73764 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/8,9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,13,14</a>]. In one outbreak, <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> was isolated from throat cultures in 14 patients, illustrating the propensity for involvement of lymphoid tissue, such as the tonsils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This symptom can be a helpful diagnostic clue, since no other cause of acute bacterial diarrhea routinely causes pharyngitis.</p><p><em>Yersinia </em>septicemia can occur during acute infection, particularly among infants and individuals with impaired immunity or iron-overload states (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73024 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Rapid onset septic shock has been described in a report of 55 cases associated with blood transfusion, with an overall fatality of 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, transient bacteremia may be more common than previously recognized, even among otherwise healthy persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In Eastern Siberia and Japan, a scarlet-fever like syndrome associated with <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> has been described; this is characterized by fever, systemic illness, arthralgias, and a morbilliform or confluently erythematous rash that ultimately desquamates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Following <em>Yersinia</em> gastroenteritis, stool shedding of organisms may persist beyond the duration of diarrhea. Among 67 cases of yersiniosis in Norway, shedding was observed among 47 percent of patients following resolution of symptoms and lasted a median of 40 days (range 17 to 116 days) after onset of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Shedding may be reduced by antimicrobial treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5496264\"><span class=\"h3\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most prominent clinical manifestations in young children are fever and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Bloody diarrhea tends to be observed more frequently among children than adults. In case series of mainly pediatric patients, 20 to 60 percent reported bloody diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73764 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/5,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13</a>]. In contrast, in a series of 29 adults with yersiniosis, bloody diarrhea was noted in only 7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>High fever and vomiting are relatively common in children; abdominal pain is observed relatively infrequently. These manifestations may be clinical clues for distinguishing from infection with Shiga toxin producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC), such as <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7, which may present with bloody stools, pronounced abdominal pain, and minimal fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89479916\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudoappendicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute yersiniosis presenting with right lower abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, leukocytosis, and mild diarrhea may be confused with acute appendicitis. At surgery, findings include visible inflammation around the appendix and terminal ileum and inflammation of the mesenteric lymph nodes; the appendix itself is generally normal. <em>Yersinia</em> can be cultured from the appendix and involved lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>One outbreak of yersiniosis among children was identified because of an unusually high number of cases of suspected appendicitis; approximately 42 percent of identified cases underwent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In other outbreaks, the rates of surgical intervention have ranged from 0 to 14 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73764 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/5,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13</a>]. </p><p>In regions where the incidence of yersiniosis is high, an appreciable fraction of appendectomies occur in the setting of yersiniosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In a Belgian study of 2861 patients who underwent appendectomy for clinically suspected appendicitis, pathogenic <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> was cultured from the appendix of 3.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In 56 of 73 patients (75 percent) with an appendix culture that grew <em>Y. enterocolitica</em>, mesenteric adenitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> terminal ileitis were observed on gross examination&nbsp;instead of frank appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5496437\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5496783\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal complications of acute yersiniosis are in general rare, and include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/4,26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26-32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse ulcerating ileitis and colitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal perforation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intussusception</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paralytic ileus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic megacolon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotic small bowel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholangitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric vein thrombosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5496451\"><span class=\"h3\">Extraintestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extraintestinal complications of acute yersiniosis are also rare, and include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/4,26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26-32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septicemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic abscess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic abscess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal abscess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharyngeal abscess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocarditis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mycotic aneurysm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection of indwelling catheters and prostheses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteomyelitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septic arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung abscess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empyema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppurative lymphadenitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin manifestations (carbuncle, granuloma, vesiculobullous lesions, pustules, wound infection)</p><p/><p>Myocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and liver failure have all been reported following yersiniosis, but are extremely rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-infectious sequelae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common post-infectious sequelae are erythema nodosum and reactive arthritis; these are particularly common in Northern Europe and, for the latter, among those with the HLA-B27 tissue type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Erythema nodosum has been observed to occur following acute infection in up to 30 percent of patients in Finland, particularly among young women; it is less frequently recognized elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It typically occurs in the month after acute infection and is self-limited.</p><p>Reactive arthropathy has been described in up to 30 percent of adult patients affected in an outbreak of <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> infections in Finland; most patients had HLA-B27 tissue type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Reactive arthritis typically affects the large weight-bearing joints and begins several weeks after the onset of acute infection. Symptoms can be self-limited, lasting three to five months, or can persist and follow a relapsing pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a ten-year follow-up study of Finnish patients with reactive arthritis, 52 percent reported mild peripheral joint symptoms, 36 percent reported chronic low back pain, and 36 percent had radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The time course of these complications mirrors the humoral immune response to bacterial infections. The pathogenesis of reactive arthropathy reflects &ldquo;molecular mimicry&rdquo; (eg, the antigenic similarity of <em>Yersinia</em> antigens to antigens in the joints of susceptible individuals). The immune response to <em>Yersinia</em> antigens can cross-react against host antigens. Some studies have identified <em>Yersinia</em>-like antigens in synovial fluid, although it is unlikely that these reflect microbial growth in joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. </p><p><em>Yersinia</em> also shares an antigen with thyroid tissue that resembles the thyrotropin (TSH) binding site. Therefore, individuals with Graves disease may have antibodies that cross react with <em>Yersinia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, there is no evidence that yersiniosis actually triggers thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5496827\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall mortality from yersiniosis is relatively low. In one study including 458 Norwegian patients, only two fatalities occurred during the acute phase of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Similarly, among 1373 cases of yersiniosis in the United States between 1996 and 2007, 18 deaths (1.2 percent) were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Of the cases identified, 30 percent were hospitalized and 3 percent had documented bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no distinct clinical, radiologic, hematologic, or chemical findings that confirm the diagnosis of yersiniosis. The diagnosis is established by culture isolation from stool, mesenteric lymph nodes, pharyngeal exudates, peritoneal fluid, or blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Stool culture is the preferred clinical specimen for patients with intestinal symptoms, and stool shedding of organisms may continue for weeks after acute infection. In the setting of clinical pharyngitis, throat culture should also be obtained. Blood cultures may be diagnostic as well. Specimens of appendix or mesenteric lymph nodes obtained at surgery should be cultured. For clinical circumstances in which abscess material, pleural fluid, or other focal suppurative samples are obtained, these should be cultured as well. Culture techniques are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-yersinia-infections#H3697194\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathogenesis of Yersinia infections&quot;, section on 'Laboratory isolation'</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of newer rapid culture-independent diagnostic systems for <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> is challenging given the rarity of these infections. Two multiplex platforms showed sensitivity of 48 to 100 percent and specificity of 99.6 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Automated diagnostic systems can also lead to confusing results, such as misidentification of <em>Y. pestis</em> as <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Commercial panels are not likely to include a test for <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em>. When such platforms are used, routine culture of specimens yielding a positive signal and submission of the isolate to a reference laboratory is still important to secure the diagnosis. </p><p>Serologic tests are not used routinely in the United States but have been used for diagnosis of yersiniosis in Europe and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Simple agglutination assays have been developed for diagnosis of yersiniosis. In addition, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunoblotting can be used to detect IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies. A positive IgM assay supports the diagnosis of acute yersiniosis, as does a fourfold rise in antibody titers between acute and convalescent titers drawn several weeks apart. However, serologic findings must be interpreted with care in areas where the background seroprevalence to <em>Yersinia</em> antigens is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, the assays can be positive in some inflammatory states, and individuals with post-infectious sequelae can have oscillating antibody titers depending upon the activity of their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence assays have been developed but are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-yersinia-infections/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1856837\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em> and <em>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</em> cause yersiniosis, a diarrheal illness.
