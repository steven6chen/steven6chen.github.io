If opioid therapy by itself yields a good outcome (satisfactory analgesia and tolerable side effects) additional interventions for pain are not needed. Should the patient demonstrate a poor response to the opioid, however, therapy must be changed. This common scenario may be addressed in many ways, among which is the addition of another analgesic drug. In some cases, the use of a nonopioid analgesic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol) or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs), is sufficient. In others, significant benefit may be obtained by the addition of a so-called &ldquo;adjuvant analgesic&rdquo; or coanalgesic. This topic review will cover the use of adjuvant analgesics in cancer pain management. Assessment of cancer pain, a review of specific cancer pain syndromes, clinical use and side effects of opioid analgesics, use of acetaminophen and NSAIDs in patients with cancer pain, and nonpharmacologic methods of cancer pain management are covered elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids&quot;, section on 'General principles of pain management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-use-of-acetaminophen-and-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF AN ADJUVANT ANALGESIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &ldquo;adjuvant analgesic&rdquo; was originally coined to refer to a small number of drugs that were marketed for indications other than pain but were found to be potentially useful as analgesics in patients receiving opioid therapy. Over the past three decades, the number, diversity, and uses of these drugs have increased dramatically, and several are now indicated as first-line therapy for certain types of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, the term &ldquo;adjuvant analgesic&rdquo; has become somewhat of a misnomer, but it is still commonly applied in the context of cancer pain. The term is used interchangeably with the term &ldquo;coanalgesic&rdquo; and can be used to denote any drug with a major clinical use other than pain that is used as an analgesic in selected circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Integration into cancer pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) described an &ldquo;analgesic ladder&rdquo; approach to the use of drugs for cancer pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This influential model included references to adjuvant drugs that may be used to provide additional analgesia, treat a side effects, or manage a coexisting symptom. Specifically:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 1 of the analgesic ladder approach, which is appropriate for mild to moderate cancer-related pain, suggests the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), combined, if needed, with an adjuvant drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 2, which is appropriate for moderate cancer-related pain and pain that has not responded to step 1 drugs, includes the use of an opioid conventionally used for moderate pain, plus an adjuvant drug if needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 3, which is appropriate for severe cancer-related pain and pain that has not responded to step 2 drugs, includes the use of an opioid conventionally used for severe pain, plus an adjuvant drug if needed. </p><p/><p>The analgesic ladder approach is not an evidence-based guideline, and its most important role in the current era has been to provide a framework that highlights the central importance of opioid drugs for patients with active cancer and chronic pain that is generally moderate or severe. Its emphasis on combination therapy that might include the use of an adjuvant analgesic is also notable. </p><p>Adjuvant analgesics are often considered for treatment of chronic cancer pain when a patient is poorly responsive to opioids (ie, inability to titrate the opioid to a dose that maintains a favorable balance between analgesia and side effects). The addition of an adjuvant analgesic is one approach among many that may be considered for such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Alternative approaches may include rotation to a different opioid, more aggressive treatment of the side effect that is limiting the needed dose escalation, or a trial of an intervention (such as a nerve block) or other nonpharmacologic treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;, section on 'Dose titration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some experts believe that as a general rule, a trial of an adjuvant analgesic should be considered only after efforts have been made to optimize opioid therapy by individualizing the dose. This approach ensures that the second drug is needed, reduces the risk of additive toxicity by eliminating the need to titrate both drugs simultaneously, and limits confusion in determining the source of an adverse drug effect should one arise. Although data from a systematic review provide some support for this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], it is not universally accepted. Other experts believe that early use of adjuvant analgesics, usually in tandem with cautious opioid titration, may lead to better outcomes. This may be especially the case with neuropathic pain in a patient without active cancer. (See <a href=\"#H419768671\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no published data that inform the decision about the timing of adjuvant analgesic therapy, and this remains a matter of clinical judgment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Available agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large and growing number of adjuvant analgesics can be categorized on the basis of how they are used in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This information is evolving as new trials are conducted, as clinical experience expands, and as treatments that were developed for populations with non-cancer pain are extrapolated to the cancer population. Based upon conventional practice, the categories of available agents include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80423 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82318 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs potentially useful for any type of pain (multipurpose analgesics)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs used for treatment of neuropathic pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs used for bone pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs used for pain and other symptoms in the setting of bowel obstruction</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIPURPOSE ANALGESICS FOR ANY TYPE OF CHRONIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some drug classes have been studied in diverse types of chronic pain. The evidence of broad analgesic efficacy supports the view that the specific agents within these classes (including glucocorticoids, antidepressants, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, cannabinoids, and topical therapies) as well as botulinum toxin can be viewed as multipurpose analgesics that have potential value for multiple types of chronic pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids may be beneficial for a variety of types of pain, including neuropathic and bone pain, pain associated with capsular expansion or duct obstruction, pain from bowel obstruction, pain caused by lymphedema, and headache caused by increased intracranial pressure. However, specific recommendations for use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of cancer-related pain are not evidence based due to limitations in the existing literature. </p><p>A large body of clinical experience suggests that glucocorticoids may be beneficial for a variety of types of pain. However, the randomized trials that have been conducted to assess the analgesic properties of glucocorticoids in cancer patients have been small and have produced mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/5-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-13</a>]. A 2015 systematic review of six randomized trials found that glucocorticoid therapy resulted in modestly less pain as compared with control treatment (placebo or standard therapy) at one week (mean difference 0.84 [95% CI 1.38-0.30] lower pain score on a 1 to 10 scale) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The quality of the evidence was weak, however, and the authors concluded that additional trials are needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoids for management of cancer pain in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Nociceptive pain'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of agent and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> is usually preferred for the management of cancer-related pain, presumably because of its long half-life and relatively low mineralocorticoid effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64138 \">table 3</a>). However, there is no empiric evidence that this drug is either safer or more effective in the cancer population than any other glucocorticoid. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> are acceptable alternatives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A typical regimen for patients with cancer-related pain is 1 to 2 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> orally or parenterally twice daily; this may be preceded by a larger loading dose of 10 to 20 mg. This regimen (or comparable regimens of alternative steroids) is based on clinical experience and is not evidence based. Patients may do well with lower or higher doses, or with once-daily rather than twice-daily dosing.</p><p>Regardless of the regimen that is selected, the intent is usually for ongoing chronic use in the setting of advanced illness. In this situation, the risk of long-term toxicity, which includes myopathy, immunocompromise, psychotomimetic effects, and hypoadrenalism, is attenuated by the limited life expectancy and the need to address the multiple sources of suffering. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are some situations for which a brief regimen of high-dose glucocorticoids might be selected. Originally developed for the treatment of emerging epidural spinal cord compression (including cauda equina syndrome), a brief period of high-dose glucocorticoids may be considered for any &ldquo;pain crisis,&rdquo; which is defined as severe and escalating pain that is not responding sufficiently to an opioid.</p><p>In such cases, a typical regimen consists of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> loading dose of 50 to 100 mg intravenously, which may be followed by 12 to 24 mg four times daily; this dose is then tapered over one to three weeks, usually as some other intervention, such as radiation therapy or a pain intervention (eg, neural blockade), is used to treat the pain.</p><p>Although the high-dose regimen is administered with the expectation that it will provide more rapid and substantial pain relief than a lower-dose regimen, the only evidence for this originates from populations with epidural spinal cord compression, and even these data are conflicting. Both the limited evidence and the potential for dose-related toxicity (which is clearly higher with higher-dose regimens) must be recognized when weighing the potential benefits of the high-dose approach. This subject is addressed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical trials'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesic antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a patient with chronic cancer pain that is poorly responsive to opioid therapy who also has a depressed mood, we suggest an early trial of an analgesic antidepressant. Preferred options include a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, or a secondary tricyclic drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>. Given its activating effect, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> is reasonable if cancer pain is complicated by fatigue or somnolence, even though the evidence of analgesic efficacy is weak. Bupropion should be avoided in patients at risk for seizures.</p><p>Antidepressants have been widely studied in populations with chronic pain, and the available data suggest that these drugs act as multipurpose analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/1,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15-18</a>]. Although very few of these studies have included cancer patients, the utility of these drugs for treatment of cancer pain has been extrapolated from data in other conditions. </p><p>In opioid-treated populations with advanced medical illness, antidepressants have been predominantly used for neuropathic pain. However, given the range of their potential analgesic efficacy, they could be considered for other types of chronic pain as well. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathic pain'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Neuropathic pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of analgesic effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antidepressants function as primary analgesics. Although pain reduction may be enhanced if there is a positive mood effect, analgesia is not dependent on mood elevation, and pain can be improved in euthymic patients. If a patient with chronic cancer pain has a depressed mood, a relatively early trial of an analgesic antidepressant is appropriate in the hope of achieving a separate and positive effect on mood.</p><p>The primary analgesic mode of action is thought to be related to the enhanced availability of monoamines at synapses within neural pathways that are part of the descending pain modulating system. Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake appears to be the most important mode of action, but serotonergic and dopaminergic effects also may play a role in analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Selection of agent and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antidepressants comprise several subclasses and numerous drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80423 \">table 1</a>). Analgesic efficacy is best established for some of the tricyclic compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/15,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20-22</a>] and the SNRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/18,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22-25</a>] (although benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> is debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]). There is minimal evidence of analgesic efficacy with the serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/15,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27,28</a>]. Benefit has also been suggested for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> (a dopamine reuptake inhibitor) in patients with neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>The tricyclic antidepressants include tertiary amines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, and secondary amines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>. The secondary amines are more selective at noradrenergic reuptake sites, and they have a more favorable side effect profile than amitriptyline. As a result, when a tricyclic is chosen in a medically ill patient, desipramine or nortriptyline is usually preferred. All of the tricyclic compounds are relatively contraindicated in patients with serious heart disease, severe prostatic hypertrophy, and narrow-angle glaucoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>There is strong evidence that at least some of the SNRIs (which include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desvenlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desvenlafaxine</a>) have analgesic effects; this is best established with duloxetine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/24,25,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,31</a>]. A five-week randomized trial of duloxetine in patients with chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy found that the drug was analgesic at a dose of 30 to 60 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Importantly, there are no trials comparing different drugs within the SNRI class for this indication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy#H523404783\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&quot;, section on 'Duloxetine and other antidepressants'</a>.)</p><p>Overall, the side effect profile of SNRIs (which includes nausea, sexual dysfunction, and somnolence or mental clouding) is favorable relative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>. There is a great deal of individual variation, however. Among patients with serious medical illness, such as those with cancer, the first-line analgesic antidepressants to consider should be either a secondary amine tricyclic compound (usually desipramine) or an SNRI (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>), and the decision between these drugs usually is based on a case-by-case assessment of risk and cost.</p><p>We view most other antidepressants as second-line drugs, typically considered if the initial therapeutic attempt yields side effects or a limited analgesic response. One exception is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is distinguished by its tendency to be activating. Given this latter effect, a trial of bupropion sometimes is considered early if cancer pain is complicated by fatigue or somnolence, even though the evidence of analgesic efficacy is weak. Bupropion should be avoided in patients at risk for seizures.</p><p>All of the analgesic antidepressants should be started at a relatively low initial dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82318 \">table 2</a>). The starting dose for a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>, for example, is 10 to 25 mg at night. The dose should be increased no more quickly than every few days in the absence of satisfactory relief or side effects. If analgesia is going to occur at any given dose, it typically appears within a week (developing more rapidly than the antidepressant effects). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment#H21696516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Early improvement and response'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients who experience pain relief with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> respond at a dose between 50 and 150 mg per day. However, the tricyclics may have a drug concentration-response relationship for analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and if neither analgesia nor intolerable side effects occur, continued dose escalation is reasonable. At relatively high doses (ie, above 100 mg per day), the plasma drug concentration and an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be checked. Tricyclic antidepressants can prolong the QTc interval and predispose to cardiac arrhythmias. These drugs should be used cautiously when a patient has known heart disease or is receiving other drugs (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) that can prolong the QT interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Plasma levels and therapeutic response'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Cardiac evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Other antidepressants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, should similarly be started at a relatively low initial dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82318 \">table 2</a>) and titrated to conventional maximal doses to determine whether an analgesic or positive mood effect occurs. Unlike the tricyclics, these drugs do not prolong the QTc interval.

Until newer cannabinoid preparations such as nabiximols become available in the United States, the clinical use of a cannabinoid for cancer pain must employ a drug that is marketed for purposes other than pain, specifically dronabinol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabilone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabilone</a>. Given the limited evidence of efficacy, a trial of one of these drugs is rarely considered for patients who are refractory to opioids and other appropriate adjuvant analgesics; most of these patients will have neuropathic pain. The use of smoked, vaporized, or ingested cannabis (marijuana) for refractory cancer pain continues to be controversial.</p><p>Cannabinoids are derived from the cannabis (marijuana) plant, which contains over 400 compounds, including more than 60 cannabinoids. The primary psychoactive cannabinoid is THC. In vivo, cannabinoid molecules such as THC interact with an endogenous system that includes cannabinoid-like ligands (the endocannabinoids) as well as multiple receptors in both the periphery and central nervous system.

Patients should be aware of the limited evidence to support benefit in cancer-related pain and the potential for serious adverse effects. Nabilone should be started at 0.5 to 1 mg at night and titrated up to 3 mg twice daily, or higher if tolerated. Dronabinol usually is started at a dose of 2.5 mg once or twice daily and titrated.</p><p>The use of smoked, vaporized, or ingested cannabis (marijuana) for refractory cancer pain continues to be controversial. Medical use of cannabis is legal in several countries, including the Netherlands and Canada. However, cannabis use is still illegal in the United States at the federal level (which considers marijuana a schedule I controlled substance), and individuals prescribing or using marijuana for medical use are at risk for prosecution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The continuing designation of cannabis as illicit by the federal government has not prevented the passage of state laws legalizing its use for medical conditions in many states. Although severe or chronic pain accounts for over 90 percent of the qualifying conditions for use of medicinal cannabis among registered users in the states in which it is legal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>], there are no controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of inhaled or ingested marijuana as an adjunct to traditional pain medications for patients with cancer-related pain. On the other hand, there are several published randomized trials demonstrating at least short-term benefit for smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/45,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,54-56</a>] or vaporized cannabis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/46,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,62</a>] in patients with neuropathic pain; none of the trials included patients with cancer-related pain.</p><p>An increasing number of physicians are living in states that have legalized medical cannabis, and it is likely that patients with cancer pain will seek approval or a specific recommendation for its use. Some physicians have embraced the approach, viewing the extant data and clinical anecdotes as sufficiently compelling to provide broad support. Other physicians are hesitant, however. Given the legal status of marijuana, the differences in cannabinoid concentrations across strains of cannabis and available products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], the inability to stipulate, know, or titrate the dose taken by the patient, the lack of information about potential drug-drug interactions, and the at least theoretical concerns about respiratory effects and cancer risk in cannabis smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/47,64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,64-67</a>], physicians may still take a principled stand against recommending its use where it is legal. Given the state of the science and the sociopolitical complexities, each physician must make his or her own decision while hopefully keeping an open mind. Should patients experience pain that is refractory to conventional therapies or report using and benefitting from cannabis, it is reasonable to accept a patient&rsquo;s decision to try medical cannabis and continue its use if it is helpful.</p><p>With the use of medical cannabis increasing, physicians also should be aware of withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, and hypersomnia, after sudden cessation of cannabis use and of the potential for this phenomenon to manifest, often unexpectedly, after hospital admission.

Although topical analgesics have been used mostly for neuropathic pain, they have the potential for broader application.

Some experts advocate a trial of an adjuvant analgesic for cancer-related neuropathic pain only in the setting of relatively poor opioid responsiveness, ie, after an opioid has been titrated to optimize the balance between analgesia and side effects. These proponents argue that opioids are widely used for treatment of cancer pain because of their safety, ease of titration, reliability, and effectiveness for all types of pain, including neuropathic pain. Although neuropathic pain may be more difficult to treat, a favorable response to opioid-based analgesia is often possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This view is somewhat controversial, however, and others advocate early use of adjuvant analgesics, either alone or in tandem with cautious opioid titration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. In our view, and that of others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>], first-line or concurrent use of an opioid should be considered only in patients with active cancer. Cancer survivors with no active disease (eg, those with posttreatment neuropathic pain, such as with a postmastectomy pain syndrome) are more comparable with patients with neuropathic pain that is not cancer related.

Bisphosphonates act by directly inhibiting osteoclast activity, stimulating osteoblasts to produce osteoclast-inhibiting factor, and causing osteoclast apoptosis. Osteoclast inhibition can also be achieved by targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a key component in the pathway for osteoclast formation and activation. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL, has been compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> in patients with metastatic bone disease from a variety of solid tumors; all have concluded that there may be a slight benefit for denosumab in terms of preventing skeletal-related events and in analgesic effect. This benefit must be counterbalanced by the greater cost of denosumab. Other factors may influence the selection of denosumab versus zoledronic acid. One advantage of denosumab over zoledronic acid is that it is a quick monthly subcutaneous injection and not a prolonged intravenous infusion.

Many of these drugs are useful for treatment of chronic cancer pain, and in those with active disease, they usually are considered when a patient is poorly responsive to opioids. A controversial area is the appropriate timing of a trial of an adjuvant analgesic. Some experts prefer to use adjuvant analgesics early, prior to an opioid trial for some types of pain or concurrent with an opioid trial. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition of an adjuvant analgesic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The available agents are categorized on the basis of how they are used in clinical practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80423 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Available agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">For all types of pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids may be beneficial for a variety of types of pain, including neuropathic and bone pain, pain associated with capsular expansion or duct obstruction, pain from bowel obstruction, pain caused by lymphedema, and headache caused by increased intracranial pressure. However, specific recommendations for use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of cancer-related pain are not evidence based due to limitations in the existing literature. Recommendations are based on anecdotal experience. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the setting of chronic pain, a typical regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 1 to 2 mg twice daily; this may be preceded by a larger loading dose of 10 to 20 mg. A brief period of high-dose glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone 50 to 100 mg intravenously, followed by 12 to 24 mg four times daily, tapered over one to three weeks) is appropriate for a &ldquo;pain crisis&rdquo; (severe and escalating pain that is not responding sufficiently to an opioid). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent and dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a patient with chronic cancer pain that is poorly responsive to opioid therapy who also has a depressed mood, we suggest an early trial of an analgesic antidepressant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Preferred options include a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, or a secondary tricyclic drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>. Given its activating effect, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> is reasonable if cancer pain is complicated by fatigue or somnolence, even though the evidence of analgesic efficacy is weak. Bupropion should be avoided in patients at risk for seizures. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Analgesic antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of a transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> patch could be considered in patients who have focal, peripherally generated pain. Other topical treatments that may be useful in these patients are creams containing a local anesthetic, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Topical therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For opioid-refractory patients who do not respond to first-line multipurpose adjuvant analgesics and, when appropriate, first-line drugs for neuropathic pain, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a>, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is an option. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where available, use of an oromucosal spray containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) plus cannabidiol (and smaller concentrations of other compounds; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabiximols-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabiximols</a> [Sativex]) may be tried as an adjunctive treatment for refractory pain in patients with advanced cancer. If nabiximols is not available, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabilone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabilone</a> is reasonable. The use of smoked, vaporized, or ingested cannabis (marijuana) for refractory cancer pain continues to be controversial. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cannabis and cannabinoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with otherwise refractory focal pain related to muscle or nerve pathology, a local injection of botulinum toxin is another option.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathic pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best way to integrate adjuvant analgesics into the management of neuropathic pain is debated. In our view, first-line or concurrent use of an opioid should be considered only in patients with active cancer. Cancer survivors with no active disease (eg, those with posttreatment neuropathic pain, such as with a postmastectomy pain syndrome) are more comparable with patients with neuropathic pain that is not cancer related. For these patients, early initiation of an adjuvant analgesic is the preferred approach. Opioids are considered for refractory pain on a case-by-case basis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If cancer-related neuropathic pain refractory to an opioid is associated with a significant depressed mood, we suggest first-line therapy with an antidepressant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Preferred options include an SNRI, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, or a secondary tricyclic drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Analgesic antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with neuropathic pain that is not associated with a depressed mood, we suggest first-line therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We generally prefer pregabalin because of the simplified dosing. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Gabapentin and pregabalin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the positive placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> for painful taxane- or platinum-induced neuropathy, duloxetine is an appropriate first-line agent in this setting. However, additional data will be needed to establish the superiority of duloxetine over a gabapentinoid in these patients and to establish the efficacy of duloxetine in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy from other drugs, such as vinca alkaloids. (See <a href=\"#H874772198\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy#H523404783\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&quot;, section on 'Duloxetine and other antidepressants'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For refractory cases, we suggest second-line therapy with the alternative type of agent, an antidepressant or an anticonvulsant depending on which drug was used initially.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of another anticonvulsant (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lacosamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lacosamide</a>), a cannabinoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a>), or an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a>) could be considered in patients with neuropathic pain that is refractory to opioids and other appropriate adjuvant analgesics.
