CGD is caused by defects in the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which constitutes the phagocyte oxidase (phox). These genetic defects result in the inability of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) to destroy certain microbes. The diagnosis is made by neutrophil function testing, and then the exact defect is determined by genotyping.</p><p>Infections in patients with CGD are generally caused by catalase-positive micro-organisms (most bacterial and all fungal pathogens are catalase positive), but catalase is neither necessary nor sufficient for pathogenicity in CGD. The frequent sites of infection are lung, skin, lymph nodes, and liver. The formation of granulomata is especially problematic in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Other inflammatory manifestations are seen as well.</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of CGD. The treatment and prognosis of CGD, as well as an overview of primary disorders of phagocyte function, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary disorders of phagocytic function: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819697907\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of CGD in the United States is approximately 1:200,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The disease primarily affects males as most mutations are X linked. Rates are almost identical across ethnic and racial groups, with approximately one-third of the X-linked mutations occurring de novo. However, in cultures in which consanguineous marriage is common, the autosomal recessive forms of CGD are more common than X-linked forms, and overall incidence rates may be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>CGD may present at any time from infancy to late adulthood, but the majority of patients are diagnosed as toddlers and children before the age of five years. In several series, the median age at diagnosis was 2.5 to 3 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. A growing number of patients are diagnosed in later childhood or adulthood. This is due in part to recognition of milder cases of autosomal recessive CGD, as well as delayed diagnosis in some patients. Diagnosis may be delayed because of potent antimicrobials that inadvertently treat many CGD-associated infections, postponing diagnosis until more severe infections indicate CGD as the underlying cause. X-linked CGD tends to have an earlier onset and be more severe than the most common autosomal recessive form, p47phox deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phagocytes use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase to generate reactive species of oxygen. CGD arises from mutations that result in the loss or functional inactivation of one of the subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex. (See <a href=\"#H1819697598\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> below.)</p><p>The fully assembled NADPH oxidase is a five-protein complex. In the basal state, it exists as two components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The membrane-bound heterodimer, called cytochrome b-245 or cytochrome b588, that is composed of gp91phox and p22phox and is embedded in the walls of secondary granules</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteins in the cytosol (p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox)</p><p/><p>All of these proteins are necessary for the proper generation of superoxide. Activation and assembly of the functional oxidase also requires the participation of Rac2, a small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein, and Rap1, a small GTPase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819698074\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutrophil priming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutrophils exist in one of three states: quiescent, activated, or primed. Primed neutrophils are poised to undergo an exaggerated respiratory burst or secretory response when specific receptors are triggered. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory burst'</a> below.)</p><p>Three main types of agonists are capable of priming neutrophils:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory mediators that are chemotactic</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum immunoglobulin and complement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan, granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulation factor (G-CSF), substance P, orthovanadate, and interleukin-1 (IL-1)</p><p/><p>Priming may be achieved rapidly, over a few minutes, or more slowly, over 30 minutes, depending upon the nature of the stimulus. The primed state is transient, lasting up to several hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Activation of NADPH oxidase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cytosolic components p47phox and p67phox are phosphorylated and bind tightly together after cellular activation is initiated by phagocytosis of microbes. In association with p40phox and Rac2, these proteins combine with the cytochrome complex (gp91phox and p22phox) to form the intact nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72548\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72548 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The source of reducing equivalents for the respiratory burst oxidase and the glutathione detoxification pathway is NADPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. This compound is replenished from NADP by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the hexose monophosphate shunt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory burst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the NADPH oxidase has formed, an electron is then taken from NADPH and donated to molecular oxygen, leading to the formation of superoxide. This is converted to hydrogen peroxide spontaneously or enzymatically by superoxide dismutase. In the final step, hydrogen peroxide reacts with superoxide anion, forming highly reactive hydroxyl radical that is converted to hypochlorous acid in the presence of myeloperoxidase and chlorine in the neutrophil phagosome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72548\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72548 \">figure 1</a>). The rapid consumption of oxygen and production of superoxide and its metabolites is referred to as the respiratory burst. Phagocyte production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to the activation of granule proteases, including elastase and cathepsin G. These proteases are responsible for the destruction of ingested (phagocytosed) micro-organisms. Thus, superoxide acts as an intracellular-activating molecule and not as a direct microbicidal molecule, as was previously thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Innate immune receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foreign material, such as bacteria, fungi, and parasites, display molecules that are not seen in higher organisms. Termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), these molecular components of micro-organisms are recognized by receptors globally referred to as pattern recognition receptors that include Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Patients with CGD, compared with the general population of patients with bacterial pneumonia, express lower levels of several neutrophil receptors, including TLRs (TLR5 and TLR9), complement receptors (CD11b, CD18, and CD35), and a chemokine receptor (CXCR1). In contrast, patients with pneumonia who do not have CGD generally have higher than normal expression levels of these proteins. Decreased expression results in impaired neutrophil activation (TLR5), phagocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(CD11b/CD18),</span> and chemotaxis (CXCR1). Levels of expression of TLR5 and CD18 may correlate with CGD disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11501362\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutrophil extracellular traps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutrophils can continue to participate in antimicrobial activity even after they undergo apoptosis. During neutrophil cell death, the nuclei swell, chromatin dissolves, and large strands of decondensed DNA extrude from the cell, carrying with them proteins from cytosol, granules, and histones from the nuclei themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

NET formation is probably enhanced by hydrogen peroxide, and therefore patients with CGD do not form normal NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Enhanced inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different mechanisms may be involved in the enhanced inflammation seen in patients with CGD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammatory mediators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defective production of ROS leads to increased expression of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B-regulated inflammatory genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, the majority of pathogens in general are catalase positive, and only a few cause infections in CGD, suggesting that catalase production alone is insufficient for pathogenicity.

Positive findings should be confirmed by additional testing, such genotyping. It is important to appreciate that the p47phox mutation is due to a pseudogene conversion and so may not be detectable by standard sequencing. In these cases, an immunoblot may be needed to confirm p47phox deficiency.</p><p>A history of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unusually severe infections, particularly abscesses and infections caused by the pathogens commonly associated with CGD, should prompt neutrophil-function testing. Neonatal or early postnatal screening of potentially affected children is indicated if there is a family history of CGD. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutrophil function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic tests for CGD rely on various measures of neutrophil superoxide production. These include direct measurement of superoxide production, cytochrome c reduction assay, chemiluminescence, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test, and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) oxidation test.</p><p>Most prefer the DHR test because of its objectivity, relative ease of use, ability to distinguish between X-linked and autosomal forms of CGD, and the ability to detect gp91phox carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. Other tests can provide reliable diagnosis of CGD but either cannot distinguish carrier status or require significant operator experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Dihydrorhodamine 123 test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this test, the nonfluorescent rhodamine derivative, DHR, is taken up by phagocytes and oxidized to a green fluorescent compound by products of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68461 \">figure 2</a>). The sensitivity and quantitative nature of this assay make it possible to differentiate oxidase-positive from oxidase-negative phagocyte subpopulations in CGD carriers and identify deficiencies in gp91phox and p47phox. DHR testing can also be quantitated to allow for allocation of cellular response into more and less impaired subgroups. The degree of residual superoxide production as measured by DHR testing provides important prognostic information that dovetails with genetic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Other conditions that affect the neutrophil respiratory burst, giving abnormal DHR test results but normal measures of extracellular superoxide production (eg, cytochrome c reduction or NBT tests), include myeloperoxidase deficiency and the syndrome of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. The DHR test can also be used to determine chimerism status following hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Several reference laboratories in the United States and around the world offer these assays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Nitroblue tetrazolium test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oldest laboratory test for CGD is the NBT test. This provides a simple and rapid (but largely qualitative) determination of phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity. Superoxide produced by normal peripheral blood neutrophils stimulated in vitro reduces yellow NBT to dark <span class=\"nowrap\">blue/black</span> formazan, which forms a precipitate in the cells. Normal phagocyte oxidase activity will result in at least 95 percent positive cells in this assay. X-linked carriers can be identified with this test. Test limitations include a higher rate of false-negative results and operator subjectivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history usually suggests autosomal recessive or X-linked disease, based on sex, consanguinity, age at presentation, and severity. A diagnosis of CGD based on abnormal neutrophil function should be followed by a confirmatory test to verify that the patient really does have CGD before genetic counseling is provided. Sequencing of the patient's phagocyte oxidase (phox) genes to determine the exact molecular defect is recommended. Genetic testing is available through specialized commercial laboratories and selected tertiary referral centers. The p47phox defect can be difficult to identify genetically as it is caused by pseudogene conversion and may be missed in typical sequencing studies. For these cases, immunoblotting helps to identify the absent protein.</p><p>Genetic testing is increasingly important in the risk profiling of X-linked CGD. Mutations in the gene encoding gp91phox (<em>CYBB</em>) are usually either missense (replacement of the correct amino acid with an incorrect one but preserving protein synthesis) or nonsense (replacement of an amino acid with a stop codon leading to protein truncation and usually abrogating protein synthesis). Nonsense mutations generally lead to more severe CGD with diminished survival. Missense mutations that are in amino acids 1 to 309 are associated with residual superoxide formation, slight DHR positivity, and better survival. In contrast, mutations at amino acids 310 and beyond affect critical protein functional domains and lead to complete loss of DHR activity, more severe CGD, and diminished survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, gene sequencing can be used without further functional studies to predict relative mortality risk and counsel regarding bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the precise mutation of a family member with CGD is known, then chorionic villus or amniotic fluid sampling can be performed to obtain a sample for genotyping of the fetus.

However, it is usually possible to differentiate between these diseases and CGD when the entire clinical picture is examined. The differential diagnosis may consider:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis (CF)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glutathione synthetase (GS) deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crohn disease (in patients with inflammation limited to the rectum)</p><p/><p>Patients with CF may develop <em>B. cepacia</em> complex infections. However, the infections in patients with CF are limited to the lung and typically occur in the setting of significant bronchiectasis, which is not as common in patients with CGD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome develop staphylococcal infections and may develop <em>Aspergillus</em> infections in the lung. However, the <em>Aspergillus</em> infections occur only in the setting of pre-existing lung cysts, which are not common in patients with CGD. Also, hyperimmunoglobulin E patients have characteristic facies and markedly elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, whereas CGD patients do not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-hyperimmunoglobulin-e-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>G6PD deficiency and GS deficiency affect the neutrophil respiratory burst and increase susceptibility to bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/107-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-109</a>]. G6PD deficiency is most often associated with some degree of hemolytic anemia, whereas CGD is not. Severe GS deficiency is also associated with hemolytic anemia, in addition to 5-oxoprolinuria, acidosis, and mental retardation. These disorders are reviewed separately.

However, Crohn disease is not associated with severe infections, as is CGD. While Crohn disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract and may have extraintestinal manifestations, CGD colitis is more often rectal and perirectal and is not associated with extraintestinal manifestations. Histopathologically, CGD bowel biopsies have lipid-laden macrophages, which are not characteristic of Crohn disease.</p><p>In vitro, the respiratory burst may also be inhibited by diverse pathogens, including <em>Legionella pneumophila</em>, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Chlamydia</em>, <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, and <em>Ehrlichia risticii</em>.

Most patients are diagnosed before the age of five years. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CGD is caused by defects in phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which comprises the phagocyte oxidase (phox). This enzyme complex is responsible for the phagocyte respiratory burst. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in all five genes (gp91phox, p47phox, p22phox, p67phox, and p40phox) that make up the NADPH oxidase complex account for all of the known cases of CGD. Most mutations are X linked (gp91phox). (See <a href=\"#H1819697598\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CGD typically experience recurrent infections caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens. The frequent sites of infection are lung, skin, lymph nodes, and liver. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overwhelming majority of infections in patients with CGD living in North America are due to five organisms: <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia</em> complex, <em>Serratia marcescens</em>, <em>Nocardia</em>, and <em>Aspergillus</em>. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Organisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CGD are prone to the formation of granulomata that are especially problematic in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Colitis is a common gastrointestinal manifestation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory and other manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female carriers generally do not have an increased rate of infections, but they are more predisposed to certain inflammatory manifestations associated with CGD. However, highly lyonized females can develop typical CGD infections. (See <a href=\"#H1819698399\" class=\"local\">'X-linked carriers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A neutrophil function test, dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), is the initial diagnostic test performed. A significantly abnormal finding should be confirmed by genotyping. Those with severe X-linked mutations are at higher risk for infection and mortality and may be candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation.
