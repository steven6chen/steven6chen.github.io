These rare conditions include transient acquired neonatal myasthenia gravis, congenital myasthenia, elevated levels of magnesium or aminoglycosides, and infantile botulism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66572 \">table 1</a>). They are characterized by abnormal neuromuscular transmission leading to muscle fatigability and weakness. Most of these disorders are transient, but congenital forms are permanent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL MYASTHENIA GRAVIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis occurs in 10 to 20 percent of infants born to mothers with myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most mothers of affected infants have active clinical disease, although some may have no evidence of myasthenia or may be in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies that usually are directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), resulting in postsynaptic inhibition of neuromuscular transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Maternal AChR antibodies transferred to the fetus are responsible for transient neonatal myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Higher ratios of antibodies directed against the fetal versus the adult type of AChR in mothers with myasthenia gravis are correlated with an increased likelihood of transmitting the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Rarely, there are persistent myopathic sequelae related to the fetal acetylcholine receptor inactivation syndrome (FARIS). Although the pathophysiologic mechanism is not established, this condition is probably related to elevated levels of maternal AChR antibodies directed against the fetal subunit of the AChR receptor, causing abnormal endplate development of the embryonic neuromuscular junction in a subset of infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The facial and bulbar musculature may be particularly susceptible to permanent injury caused by this process.</p><p>Among mothers with a child affected by transient neonatal MG, the risk of recurrence with subsequent pregnancies is approximately 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1,4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal myasthenia gravis typically presents within a few hours of birth. Signs are always apparent by the third day of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. More severely affected infants have a history of polyhydramnios and may have arthrogryposis multiplex (multiple joint contractures) at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Newborns with myasthenia have generalized weakness and hypotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, deep tendon reflexes are present. Facial diplegia often occurs; ptosis and ophthalmoplegia occur less often. Bulbar weakness is frequent, leading to poor sucking and swallowing and a weak cry. Pooling of secretions and respiratory muscle weakness may contribute to respiratory failure and the need for assisted ventilation.</p><p>With prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, most newborns recover within a few weeks (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). Treatment is more difficult and recovery is slower in more severely affected patients.</p><p>In the rare fetal acetylcholine receptor inactivation syndrome, there are persistent manifestations characterized by facial and bulbar myopathy or arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, sometimes accompanied by hearing loss or pyloric stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of neonatal myasthenia gravis should be suspected in the infant of a mother with myasthenia. If the mother does not have known disease, the diagnostic test is the response of the infant to administration of an anticholinesterase inhibitor. The agent used most commonly is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">neostigmine</a> methylsulfate (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM or SQ).</p><p>This test should be performed only in a setting where resuscitation can readily be performed. When the test is diagnostic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">neostigmine</a> results in clinical improvement that begins in approximately 15 minutes and continues for one to three hours. Success should be determined by a measurable response (eg, an improvement in ventilation or time to drink an amount of fluid) of &gt;15 percent. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Atropine</a> may be needed to control muscarinic side effects, such as diarrhea and increased tracheal secretions.</p><p>Some experts prefer the anticholinesterase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">edrophonium</a> (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM or SQ, or IV in fractional amounts delivered over several minutes after a test dose of 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. This agent acts more rapidly, and muscarinic side effects are less intense. However, respiratory arrest occasionally occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Complications of prematurity or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy may occasionally interfere with an infant's response to administration of an anticholinesterase inhibitor. In these cases, repetitive nerve stimulation can be used to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This test compares the amplitude of the fifth evoked compound muscle action potential with the first, before and after administration of an anticholinesterase inhibiting agent. A positive response is reduction of the fifth action potential by 10 percent or more and reversal of this decrement by the anticholinesterase inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of neonatal myasthenia is supportive. Small frequent feedings are provided by nasogastric or orogastric tube, and assisted ventilation is provided if needed. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">neostigmine</a> methylsulfate (0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM or SQ) is given 30 minutes before each feeding. When feeding and respiratory abnormalities have improved, the drug can be given orally (0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> PO approximately 45 minutes prior to feeding). Excessive doses may result in increased secretions, diarrhea, weakness, and muscle fasciculations.</p><p>With continued clinical improvement, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">neostigmine</a> dose can be lowered gradually. In addition, the course of the disease can be monitored by repeat nerve stimulation testing and measurement of acetylcholine receptor antibodies.</p><p>In one case of a child (age five years) with severe facial muscle weakness due to suspected fetal acetylcholine receptor inactivation syndrome, prior treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pyridostigmine</a> was not beneficial, but there was significant symptom improvement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, most newborns recover within a few weeks; ninety percent of patients recover fully before reaching two months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tube feeding and assisted ventilation rarely are required for longer than one to two weeks. The average duration of pharmacologic treatment is four weeks.</p><p>Although data are limited to a few cases, the fetal acetylcholine receptor inactivation syndrome has been associated with a broad spectrum of severity, ranging from profound arthrogryposis, respiratory weakness, and early death to mild but permanent weakness of the facial and bulbar muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL MYASTHENIC SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are uncommon causes of neuromuscular junction failure in newborns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52202 \">table 2</a>).

Newborns with CMS frequently have ptosis, in contrast to patients with transient neonatal myasthenia gravis. In addition, several subtypes of CMS (eg, primary acetylcholine receptor deficiency, acetylcholinesterase deficiency, and fast channel syndrome) typically demonstrate ophthalmoplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Most cases in the United States are thought to result from ingestion of environmental dust containing C. botulinum spores, and residence near activities that disturb the soil such as construction or agricultural cultivation may enhance exposure. Foodborne cases can result from ingestion of wild honey or home canned foods contaminated with C. botulinum spores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Young age and the absence of competitive bowel flora are factors that predispose to vulnerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Colostrum in breast milk offers some protection, but breast fed infants may become susceptible during the transition to formula or solid foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features result from progressive neuromuscular blockade and range from mild to severe. Muscles innervated by the cranial nerves are affected first, followed by those of the trunk, extremities, and diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Infants typically present with constipation and poor feeding. This presentation is followed by progressive hypotonia, and weakness. Loss of deep tendon reflexes appears to occur more commonly in type B infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Cranial nerve dysfunction is manifested by decreased gag and suck, diminished range of eye movement, pupillary paralysis, and ptosis. Autonomic signs include decreased tearing and salivation, fluctuating heart rate and blood pressure, and flushed skin.</p><p>Infant botulism may present with or progress to life-threatening respiratory failure, and serious complications may develop during the course. In a clinical trial, most infants required intensive care and about half required mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In atypical cases, infants may present with catastrophic collapse or rapid deterioration following brief periods of poor feeding but without the typical initial complaints of constipation, ptosis, or facial weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Prior to the advent of BIG-IV treatment, the duration of illness was usually one to two months, and occasional infants might relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Untreated type A infant botulism was longer in duration and more severe than type B illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of infant botulism should be suspected in any infant with acute onset of weak suck, ptosis, inactivity, and constipation. However, infant botulism is a rare disorder, and the diagnosis is often missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As an example, the diagnosis was suspected on admission in only half of the infants enrolled in a randomized trial who had laboratory-confirmed infant botulism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Serum samples for botulinum toxin are often negative in cases of infant botulism. The diagnosis is supported by the isolation of C. botulinum spores from the stool and is confirmed by the identification of botulinum toxin in stool samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, stool sample collection can be difficult because constipation is a nearly constant feature of infant botulism. In addition, stool sample assays do not yield timely results. Anaerobic cultures often take up to six days for growth and identification of the organism, and initial detection of toxin requires one to four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The delays with these confirmatory tests are important since, as described in the next section, therapy should be administered as early as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Thus, a presumptive diagnosis should be made based upon the clinical presentation and electrophysiologic findings while the confirmatory stool studies are pending. Electromyography (EMG) findings consistent with infant botulism are not pathognomonic and may not be present early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Nevertheless, certain EMG findings support the diagnosis of botulism when coupled with the appropriate clinical presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetitive nerve stimulation at rates of 20 to 50 Hz with an abnormal incremental response. An incremental response to 50 Hz stimulation is seen in 92 percent of infants with botulism poisoning, compared with 20 percent of normal infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMG showing short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis for infant botulism includes brainstem encephalitis, cerebral infarction, dehydration, drug ingestion, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, metabolic encephalopathy, myasthenia gravis, neuromuscular disorders, and sepsis.</p><p>In clinical practice, spinal muscular atrophy type I and metabolic disorders are the most frequent mimics of infant botulism.

This recommendation is reasonable even though a single BIG-IV infusion should neutralize all botulinum toxin available for absorption for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a> should be used to treat patients with wound botulism after antitoxin has been administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

These rare conditions include transient acquired neonatal myasthenia gravis, congenital myasthenia, elevated levels of magnesium or aminoglycosides, and infantile botulism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66572 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis occurs in 10 to 20 percent of infants born to mothers with myasthenia gravis. Newborns with myasthenia have generalized weakness and hypotonia. Neonatal myasthenia gravis typically presents within a few hours of birth. Signs are always apparent by the third day of age. Facial diplegia often occurs; ptosis and ophthalmoplegia occur less often. Bulbar weakness is frequent. If the mother does not have known disease, the diagnostic test is the response of the infant to administration of an anticholinesterase inhibitor. Management is supportive. Ninety percent of patients recover fully before reaching two months of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal myasthenia gravis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The congenital myasthenic syndromes are uncommon causes of neuromuscular junction failure in newborns &#160; These disorders are caused by genetic defects in presynaptic, synaptic basal lamina, and postsynaptic components of the neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52202 \">table 2</a>). Newborns with congenital myasthenia frequently have ptosis, in contrast to patients with the transient disorder, and typically demonstrate ophthalmoplegia and bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Affected infants may have fluctuating generalized hypotonia and weakness and life-threatening episodes of apnea. Congenital myasthenia often improves with age, but spontaneous exacerbations may occur and sometimes result in sudden death in infancy. A definitive genetic diagnosis is useful for directing treatment, supplying prognosis, and providing genetic counseling. The management of CMS depends upon the specific disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F105466\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105466 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Congenital myasthenic syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive concentrations of magnesium or aminoglycosides may inhibit neuromuscular transmission in newborns. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Elevated magnesium or aminoglycoside levels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infant botulism affects infants between one week and 12 months of age. The clinical features result from progressive neuromuscular blockade and range from mild to severe. Muscles innervated by the cranial nerves are affected first, followed by those of the trunk, extremities, and diaphragm. The diagnosis should be suspected in any infant with acute onset of weak suck, ptosis, inactivity, and constipation. Infants with clinical signs, symptoms, or history suspicious for botulism should be hospitalized immediately and monitored for signs of respiratory failure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism-immune-globulin-intravenous-human-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Botulism immune globulin</a> intravenous (BIG-IV or BabyBIG) is safe and effective therapy for infant botulism and should be administered as early as possible.
