The medical term for hives is &quot;urticaria.&quot; Physical hives are hives that form in response to some sort of physical stimulation, such as heat, cold, or pressure.</p><p>The most common causes of physical hives include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scraping or stroking</strong> &ndash; People who get this type of hives develop red, raised lines on their skin along areas that have been scraped or stroked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87054\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87054 \">picture 2</a>). Doctors call this &quot;dermatographism.&quot; If you get this type of hives, your skin might get a hive pattern that matches your fingernails after you scratch an itch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cold</strong> &ndash; People who are sensitive to cold get hives when their skin starts to warm up again after being cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased body temperature or sweating</strong> &ndash; People who are sensitive to heat or sweat get lots of tiny hives, often when they cool off after a hot shower or cool down after exercising hard.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vibration</strong> &ndash; People who are sensitive to vibration get hives on parts of their body that have been touching something that vibrates. If you get this type of hives, you might get them on your palms after you have been driving and holding onto a steering wheel, or after mowing the lawn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pressure</strong> &ndash; People who are sensitive to pressure can get redness and swelling anywhere on their body that has been pressed on. The swelling can start hours after the pressure. For example, if you have this problem, you might get a swollen palm a few hours after carrying a heavy bag by the handles. Or you might also get swelling of the soles of the feet after walking a long way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise</strong> &ndash; Hives that show up during exercise can be a sign of a dangerous problem called exercise-induced anaphylaxis. If the hives show up after exercise, when cooling down, they are more likely to be the type triggered by changes in body temperature or sweating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sunlight or water</strong> &ndash; Hives caused by sunlight or water are rare.</p><p/><p>Physical hives tend to go away and come back over a period of years. They are considered a type of chronic (or long-lasting) hives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19261365\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse if you aren't sure what is causing your hives or you aren't sure how to avoid the thing that triggers them.</p><p>You should also see a doctor if you have ever had symptoms of a dangerous allergic reaction called &quot;anaphylaxis.&quot; Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, sounding hoarse, wheezing (hearing a whistling sound when you breathe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling, especially around the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, or feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or passing out</p><p/><p>Anaphylaxis can happen with certain kinds of physical hives. For example, if you have cold-induced hives, you could go into anaphylaxis if you go swimming in very cold water. Another example is exercise-induced anaphylaxis. If you have exercise-induced hives, it is important to stop and rest immediately if you develop hives. Continuing to exercise can be very dangerous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19261380\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will probably try to recreate the conditions that give you hives. For example, if you normally get hives in places where you are scratched, the doctor or nurse might gently scratch your skin. That way, he or she can study your skin's response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19261397\"><span class=\"h1\">How are physical hives treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important part of treatment is to try to avoid whatever triggers the hives. There are also medicines called antihistamines that can reduce the itching and swelling caused by hives. Some examples of these medicines include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Cetirizine</a> (brand name: ZYRTEC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Loratadine</a> (sample brand names: Alavert, Claritin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Fexofenadine</a> (brand name: Allegra)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19261412\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-hives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic hives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hives-urticaria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hives (urticaria) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
