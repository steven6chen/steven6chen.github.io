The most common complication is thrombosis of the fistula or graft, which is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis arteriovenous graft dysfunction and failure&quot;</a>), but other problems such as seroma, extremity swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm</span> formation, neuropathy, extremity ischemia, heart failure, and infection can also occur. These complications are reviewed here. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12721967\"><span class=\"h1\">UPPER VERSUS LOWER EXTREMITY ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications of arteriovenous (AV) hemodialysis access in the lower extremity mirror those of the upper extremity for autogenous and prosthetic access. However, in the literature, complications are almost exclusively reviewed with respect to patients with upper extremity AV access, predominantly due to the infrequency of lower extremity access, which is reserved for patients who have exhausted their upper extremity sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Important differences pertaining to the development of complications between the lower versus upper extremity include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower extremities are more often affected by peripheral occlusive disease. Although symptomatic steal may affect the upper and lower extremity equally, the need for upper extremity amputation is uncommon, whereas lower extremity tissue loss and major amputation as a complication of lower extremity hemodialysis access is not infrequent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proximity of the lower extremity access to the lower gastrointestinal tract likely predisposes these sites to a higher incidence of infectious complications. Body habitus also affects the ability to maintain an adequate state of basic hygiene in the region of the access. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannulation may be more difficult in lower extremity access and predisposes to hematoma and aneurysm formation when &quot;easier&quot; sites are repeatedly accessed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compartment syndrome can occur after femoral vein transposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>In retrospective reviews of lower extremity hemodialysis access, nonthrombotic complications occurred in approximately one-half of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Seromas typically form in the arterial limb of the graft where intraluminal pressure is higher, although the same process can occur in the venous limb if there is significant central venous obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Seromas usually form slowly, beginning within 30 days after implantation of the graft; however, a more acute presentation mimicking a hematoma has been reported. Graft revision may become necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12722594\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTREMITY SWELLING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extremity swelling is most commonly due to central vein stenosis but can also be due to venous valvular incompetence, which results in chronic elevation of the venous pressure in the extremity. The resulting venous hypertension can lead to skin discoloration, access dysfunction, and potentially ischemic changes of the skin. Although mild-to-moderate extremity swelling is common initially following access surgery, it usually subsides. If the problem persists beyond two weeks, an underlying problem will be found in approximately 25 percent of cases. Imaging the central veins with duplex ultrasound can be challenging due to the overlying bony structures. Venography, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, may be needed. Treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying vascular problem. The preferred approach for central vein stenosis is percutaneous venous angioplasty. In cases where the stenosis is surgically accessible, a direct surgical approach may be feasible, which may consist of venous patch angioplasty or graft revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the creation of an arteriovenous fistula, venography may be performed in patients who are suspected of having central venous stenosis, as evidenced by dilated chest wall veins. A history of ipsilateral tunneled catheter use should prompt preoperative imaging.

True aneurysms are abnormally dilated (&gt;150 percent the normal diameter) focal regions of a blood vessel that contain all the layers of the vessel wall. The etiology of true aneurysms in AV access is unclear. Proposed etiologies include increased venous pressure due to a central venous stenosis, repeated punctures at the same site, and immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In a large systematic review of 14 unique cohorts, the median rate of aneurysm formation was 0.04 events per 1000 patient-days (range 0 to 3.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A pseudoaneurysm represents a focal disruption of the vessel wall with a collection of blood outside the vessel wall that is contained by fibrous tissue. Pseudoaneurysms usually result from repeated cannulation in the same area of the access and are a particular problem with AV grafts, occurring with increasing frequency over time as the graft material deteriorates. Cannulation through a pseudoaneurysm should be avoided. Pseudoaneurysms can be prevented by rotating the sites of needle insertion.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms</span> are at risk for complications including rupture, infection, and erosion of the overlying skin. Any of the following changes in the overlying skin require urgent evaluation to prevent rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eschar formation that does not heal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous bleeding from access sites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid expansion in pseudoaneurysm size</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposed graft</p><p/><p>The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(K/DOQI)</span> guidelines and the 2006 Canadian Society of Nephrology hemodialysis guidelines suggest that primary AV fistulas should be revised when an aneurysm develops if [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin overlying the fistula is compromised</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a risk of fistula rupture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available puncture sites are limited</p><p/><p>AV grafts with degenerative changes may also require repair to prevent rupture.

Symptomatic steal occurs in up to 20 percent of patients receiving an upper extremity access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], with severe manifestations requiring intervention in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In patients with chronic hemodialysis AV access, factors that contribute to the development of steal include failure of adequate collateral flow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive fistula blood flow (large fistula). Although the presence of a significant arterial stenosis increases the likelihood, steal can occur in the absence of stenosis. It is more common following creation of a high-flow <span class=\"nowrap\">brachiocephalic/basilic</span> fistula than a more distal fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Vascular steal typically manifests a median of two days after the placement of a prosthetic AV graft, whereas steal associated with an AV fistula is delayed as the blood flow through the access progressively increases as the fistula matures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Severe ischemic symptoms, characterized by loss of sensation or weakness, may be more common among patients with diabetes and those of advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]. Less severe symptoms and signs, such as paresthesias and a sense of coolness with retained pulses, are more common and usually improve over a period of weeks with the development of collateral blood flow. Careful, frequent clinical evaluation and an alert nursing staff are required in this setting. Symptoms often worsen during dialysis sessions. </p><p>Physical examination can confirm a diagnosis of vascular steal if the patient's symptoms improve while manually compressing the access. However, physical examination alone may not be accurate in identifying the anatomic cause of the vascular steal, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, among patients presenting with symptoms of extremity ischemia, there should be a low threshold to obtain noninvasive vascular evaluation using duplex ultrasound, which may identify the presence of arterial stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flow reversal, and physiologic tests such as digital waveforms and pressures with and without fistula compression, which are sensitive for a diagnosis of steal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. If noninvasive studies are unrevealing and ischemic symptoms persist, arteriography of the extremity may identify an anatomic problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Severe or persistent ischemic symptoms warrant further evaluation and treatment, when possible, to prevent the development of permanent injury. If the revascularization is not possible, the AV access will require ligation. Percutaneous catheter-based intervention may be an option in patients with ischemic symptoms found to have proximal inflow arterial stenosis or progressive arterial occlusive disease in the extremity distal to the fistula origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. One prospective study evaluated the effectiveness of percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty or surgical intervention in patients with an arteriogram demonstrating a distal native arterial stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Arterial stenosis was found in 10 of 12 patients with steal, 8 of whom underwent successful angioplasty. At a mean follow-up of eight months, all patients treated with angioplasty were successfully using their access.</p><p>If surgical intervention is required and preservation of the AV fistula is a high priority, the procedure with the longest history and most studied procedure is the Distal Revascularization-Interval Ligation (DRIL) procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76970 \">figure 1</a>). With this procedure, the artery is ligated distal to the anastomosis to prevent retrograde flow and persistent steal, and perfusion to the hand is restored with a distal bypass procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/13,30-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30-37</a>]. The ligation and bypass procedures can be performed at a single surgery; staged procedures are rarely needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Other surgical interventions that avoid having distal perfusion dependent upon the bypass graft include the Proximalization of Arterial Inflow (PAI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], Revision Using Distal Inflow (RUDI), and the Minimally Invasive Limited Ligation Endoluminal-assisted Revision (MILLER) procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76970 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. There are few direct comparisons between these procedures. One retrospective review compared DRIL with RUDI procedures for the treatment of ischemic symptoms among 58 of 2035 autogenous AV accesses created over the study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The main indication for intervention was tissue loss, which occurred in 61 percent; the remainder had ischemic rest pain. There were no significant differences in primary patency, cumulative secondary patency, survival at one and three years, or in resolution or improvement in <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/healing</span> of&nbsp;ischemic ulcers or amputations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933249047\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemic monomelic neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN) is a rare complication that is likely in the spectrum of ischemic steal but has distinct characteristics from the typical presentation. The incidence of IMN is difficult to ascertain from the literature but is in the range of less than 1 percent of vascular access creations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. IMN is characterized by immediate onset after the vascular access operation and is significantly more likely to occur in patients who have vascular access creation with brachial artery inflow. In contrast to typical steal, patients with IMN have profound motor and sensory deficits without other associated manifestations of tissue ischemia such as tissue loss. Electromyography performed on patients with IMN demonstrates signs of acute denervation, which can result in permanent neurologic damage. The treatment for IMN is immediate ligation of the vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057054624\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary steal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic steal from an internal mammary artery coronary artery bypass from an ipsilateral upper extremity dialysis access has been reported to cause myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. When planning vascular access placement in a patient with an internal mammary bypass, it is best to use the upper extremity contralateral to the internal mammary graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Likewise, when contemplating use of the left internal mammary for coronary bypass in a dialysis patient with a left upper-extremity shunt, it may be useful to angiographically document the absence of reversal of flow in the internal mammary artery during diastole before using that artery as a coronary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12722176\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular access-related cardiac decompensation is a rare complication, even in patients with underlying cardiac dysfunction. Patients with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula do not have higher rates of heart failure than patients using prosthetic grafts or indwelling catheters for dialysis but may have an increase in preexisting left ventricular hypertrophy after creation of the fistula. These issues are discussed separately.

The vascular access is the source of most bacteremia episodes in hemodialysis patients. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and, less commonly, <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> are the predominant pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. Bacteremia frequently occurs during cannulation without actual fistula infection.</p><p>Risk factors for AV access infection include pseudoaneurysms, hematomas (often due to inappropriate graft cannulation), severe pruritus and scratching over needle sites, the use of hemodialysis fistulas as a route of access for injection drug abuse, and manipulation of the access during secondary surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The use of nasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> to eradicate nasal carriage of <em>S. aureus </em>can reduce the incidence of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia in hemodialysis patients. However, this approach is complicated by the development of mupirocin resistance with chronic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Thus, nasal mupirocin is best reserved for patients with repeated infection and nasal <em>S. aureus</em> carriage, and in the setting of epidemic infections in the dialysis unit.</p><p>An underappreciated infective complication is the clinically silent infection of a clotted AV graft that is no longer being used. One study addressed this issue by performing indium scans in dialysis patients with nonfunctional grafts, 20 with fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sepsis but without localizing signs, and 21 asymptomatic control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Indium scans showed uptake in the graft in all patients with clinical infection and in 15 of the controls. Graft removal revealed infected clot in all patients, including 13 of the 15 controls with positive scans. The most commonly cultured organisms were <em>S. aureus</em> or <em>S. epidermidis</em>. Graft infection, even if clinically silent, must be entertained in the dialysis patient presenting systemic symptoms and signs of infection and positive localization on a nuclear study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection occurring in native AV fistulas can usually be treated with intravenous antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical drainage. Since AV fistulas are rarely the primary source of the infection in the absence of a collection of pus, bacteremia is assumed to be a consequence of endocarditis. Thus, the 2006 <span class=\"nowrap\">NKF/Dialysis</span> Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(K/DOQI)</span> guidelines recommend six weeks of antibiotic therapy for access-mediated bacteremia in a patient with an AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. With septic emboli, surgical excision of the fistula should be performed.</p><p>By contrast, infected AV grafts generally require surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Depending upon the extent of the infection, treatment involves incision and drainage with excision of the affected graft material (if localized) or complete removal of the graft. As an example, minimal infection that develops in an area of exposed graft can often be treated with intravenous antimicrobials, excision of the exposed graft segment, and rerouting the graft through uninvolved tissue. Any skin overlying the graft that is compromised is excised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The graft that remains must have adequate soft tissue and skin coverage. The <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI</span> guidelines recommend three weeks of antibiotic therapy for access-mediated bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The graft should be evaluated frequently to ensure that the infection has been adequately controlled. </p><p>Persistent fever or bacteremia following complete removal of an infected AV access should prompt the search for another source (eg, endocarditis, osteomyelitis) or metastatic infection. Metastatic infection is much more common with cuffed hemodialysis catheters but can occur with AV fistulas or grafts. Overall patient outcome appears to be much worse when an AV access is the source of metastatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The most common complication of AV vascular access is thrombosis, which is discussed elsewhere, but other problems such as seroma, extremity swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm,</span> neuropathy, extremity ischemia, heart failure, and infection can also occur. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complications of chronic hemodialysis access in the lower extremity mirror those of the upper extremity for autogenous and prosthetic AV access. However, predominantly due to the infrequency of lower extremity access, complications are almost exclusively reviewed in the literature with respect to patients with upper extremity AV access. Some important differences between upper and lower extremity sites impact the risk of vascular access complications. (See <a href=\"#H12721967\" class=\"local\">'Upper versus lower extremity access'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrafiltration of plasma across prosthetic grafts can form a pocket of serous fluid that can become firm and gelatinous over time. Seromas typically form in the arterial limb of the graft but can form in the venous limb if venous pressure is elevated. (See <a href=\"#H12721642\" class=\"local\">'Seroma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe limb edema and the sequelae of venous hypertension are most commonly due to central vein stenosis but can also result from venous valvular incompetence. If swelling persists beyond two weeks following the creation of a vascular access, venous duplex ultrasound should be obtained and is a sensitive test to demonstrate dilated veins and reversal of flow. Treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying vascular problem. (See <a href=\"#H12722594\" class=\"local\">'Extremity swelling'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H2603299804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Venous hypertension'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms</span> of hemodialysis vascular access are at risk for complications including rupture, infection, bleeding, and erosion of the overlying skin. Aneurysm formation in AV access may be related to increased venous pressure due to central venous stenosis, repeated puncture at the same site, or immunosuppression. Pseudoaneurysms usually result from repeated cannulation of the same region of the AV vascular access and can be prevented by rotating needle insertion sites. If a pseudoaneurysm is small (&lt;5 mm), it may be possible to occlude it using direct compression under ultrasonic guidance. Severely degenerated AV access should be repaired to lower the risk of rupture. Indications include large <span class=\"nowrap\">aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms</span> (&ge;4 cm in diameter), those with skin changes overlying the access, spontaneous bleeding, and those in which the number of cannulation sites has become limited. (See <a href=\"#H12721750\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H288792103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm/megafistula'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathy in long-term dialysis patients is most often due to local amyloid deposition causing median nerve dysfunction and carpal tunnel syndrome. The vascular access also may contribute to this problem in some cases via nerve compression due to the extravasation of blood or fluid or as a result of ischemic nerve injury from a vascular steal effect. (See <a href=\"#H12722019\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H3741646505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placement of an AV access reduces perfusion of the extremity and may lead to extremity ischemia. Symptoms of steal often worsen during dialysis sessions. Factors that contribute to the development of steal include failure of adequate collateral flow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive fistula blood flow. Steal typically manifests a couple of days after placement of an AV graft, whereas steal associated with an AV fistula develops over a longer timeframe as the fistula matures and flow through the access progressively increases. Imaging the arterial circulation of the extremity will identify any native arterial stenoses, and percutaneous intervention (angioplasty) may be effective at correcting the lesion(s). For multiple stenoses or arterial occlusion, fistula revision, fistula ligation, a Distal Revascularization with Interval Ligation (DRIL) procedure, or extremity revascularization may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H12722337\" class=\"local\">'Extremity ischemia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H1625268919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Ischemia and other systemic problems'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection accounts for approximately 20 percent of hemodialysis vascular access loss. Risk factors include pseudoaneurysm, hematoma, scratching at needle sites due to pruritus, the use of hemodialysis access as a route for injection drug abuse, and manipulation of the access during secondary surgical procedures. Infection occurring in autogenous AV fistulas can usually be treated with intravenous antibiotics and, when needed, surgical drainage. Infection associated with prosthetic graft material requires removal of a portion or all of the graft.
