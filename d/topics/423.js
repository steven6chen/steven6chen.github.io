Approximately 40 to 50 percent of patients with stage IB, 55 to 70 percent of stage II, and a greater percentage of those with stage IIIA NSCLC eventually recur and die of their disease despite potentially curative surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The development of active platinum-based combinations and the completion of large clinical trials assessing the activity of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected NSCLC have led to the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve the outcome in patients with completely resected NSCLC.</p><p>The role of adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with completely resected NSCLC will be reviewed here. Other aspects of the initial treatment of patients with stages I, II, and III NSCLC are discussed separately.

Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging is the most important prognostic factor determining the likelihood of relapse and therefore predicts those most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. The eighth edition TNM staging system is used for treatment planning and prognostic purposes in patients with NSCLC. The eighth edition has replaced earlier editions of the TNM staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>). Differences in TNM groupings between the seventh and eighth editions are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>). Adjuvant chemotherapy is not indicated for patients with resected stage IA disease. Discussion of the approach according to stage is found below. Discussion of prognosis according to stage is found elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H4128251970\" class=\"local\">'Investigational strategies'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the stages are according to the eighth edition staging system, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3919122389\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage I</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1411811467\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage IA disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with stage IA disease should not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, given evidence suggesting worsened survival associated with adjuvant treatment.</p><p>In the Lung Adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cisplatin</a> Evaluation (LACE) meta-analysis, which included five studies with approximately 4600 patients with completely resected NSCLC, there was a trend toward worsened survival among patients with stage IA disease receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] of death 1.40, 95% CI 0.95-2.06) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3607822280\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage IB disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with resected stage IB disease remains controversial. We offer adjuvant chemotherapy to medically appropriate patients with stage IB disease whose tumors display one or more high-risk features, including lymphovascular invasion, poor differentiation, or high standardized uptake value (SUV) on positron emission tomography (PET; variably defined as SUV 10 or more). However, there is no consensus among expert groups. For example, for patients with stage IB NSCLC, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Cancer Care Ontario guidelines do not endorse adjuvant chemotherapy for routine use because of the lack of definitive evidence establishing improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. By contrast, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines consider either observation or adjuvant chemotherapy an appropriate option for patients with resected stage IB NSCLC, depending on risk factors for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the LACE meta-analysis discussed above, among patients with stage IB disease, there was only a nonsignificant trend toward improved overall survival (HR of death 0.93, 95% CI 0.78-1.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Studies have not clearly identified which patients with stage I disease might fall into a high-risk subset. Molecular markers may identify patients who are at higher risk of relapse who therefore may be more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, though their use should be considered investigational. (See <a href=\"#H3614002853\" class=\"local\">'Predictive biomarkers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2089421064\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage II and IIIA disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with completely resected stage II and IIIA disease, we utilize adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with a cisplatin-based regimen, consistent with guidelines from ASCO and Cancer Care Ontario [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and from the NCCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>While clinical trials from the 1970s and early 1980s did not show a consistent benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], multiple subsequent large trials using adjuvant platinum-based combinations have demonstrated a benefit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>]. Sufficient data are now available from these newer trials to conclude that adjuvant chemotherapy is useful for patients with completely resected, stage II and IIIA NSCLC. While the adjuvant chemotherapy trials have not specifically analyzed patients with multiple tumors within the same lung (T3N0 or T4N0 disease), these patients are generally treated in the same manner as other patients with stage II and IIIA disease, and are managed with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Multiple tumor nodules'</a>.)</p><p>The improved survival with adjuvant chemotherapy using modern cisplatin-based regimens was demonstrated in the LACE meta-analysis that combined individual patient data from the five largest trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-10</a>]. In a pooled analysis of 4584 patients with completely resected NSCLC with a median follow-up of 5.2 years, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of death of 5.4 percent at five years compared with no chemotherapy (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The effect on survival varied by stage, but a benefit that reached statistical significance was seen only for patients with stage II (HR of death 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95) and IIIA disease (HR of death 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.94). All five trials used cisplatin-based chemotherapy, although the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], European Big Lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and the Adjuvant Lung Project Italy (ALPI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] trials each integrated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> into multiple chemotherapy regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104 \">table 3</a>). In addition, these three trials allowed the use of adjuvant thoracic radiation at the discretion of the treating clinician, as did the Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialists' Association (ANITA) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A subsequent Cochrane meta-analysis from the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group demonstrated a 4 percent overall survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy among 8447 patients in 26 trials treated surgically without radiation, although only nonsignificant trends were observed for patients with stage II and IIIA disease, which comprised a minority of the included patients (approximately one-third) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3505077890\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage IIIB and higher</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to patients with stage IIIB and higher disease typically does not include surgery, and therefore the issue of adjuvant chemotherapy is not relevant to these populations. Discussion of the management of patients with stage IIIB disease is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'N3 disease'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with stage IV disease are typically treated with systemic therapy, taking into account disease histology and genetics. Site-specific local management of metastases may also be indicated. In select instances of oligometastatic disease, definitive local treatment may be considered. The role of adjuvant systemic treatment after definitive treatment of oligometastatic disease is also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H515095393\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'General approach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H12335569\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Systemic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255411019\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3390449843\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients requiring surgery and radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for adjuvant chemotherapy among those who will be treated with surgery and radiation are the same as for those treated with surgery alone. Specifically, for patients with resected stage II or IIIA disease, we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy rather than observation, regardless of whether radiation is indicated. Similarly, we only treat patients with stage I disease with adjuvant chemotherapy if their tumors are &gt;4 cm or have high-risk features, regardless of whether adjuvant radiation is indicated. Discussion of which patients should be treated with postoperative radiation, including those with positive margins as well as those with N2 disease, is found elsewhere.

For patients with positive margins, chemotherapy may be given either concurrently, before, or after radiation.</p><p>A Cochrane meta-analysis from the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group included results based upon individual patient data from 2660 patients in 12 trials who were managed with surgery plus RT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Approximately 95 percent of these patients had stage II or IIIA disease. There was an improvement in overall survival with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR of death 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.97), corresponding to a 4 percent increase in overall survival at five years (33 versus 29 percent). The meta-analysis did not detect a difference in outcome between patients who received chemotherapy before versus after RT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1542625595\"><span class=\"h3\">Older adult patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although older adult patients have not been well represented in adjuvant trials, the available data suggest that older adults with resected NSCLC should not be excluded from receiving adjuvant chemotherapy based upon age alone. The decision to pursue adjuvant therapy should consider both the potential benefits of such treatment and the health of the individual patient. A fit older adult is likely to derive as much benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy as a younger individual, with similar tolerance of toxicities. For those with baseline comorbidities such as hearing loss that make <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> a suboptimal choice, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> is a reasonable alternative (see <a href=\"#H740985630\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for use of cisplatin over carboplatin'</a> below). However, for frail older patients or those with significant comorbidities, the risks may outweigh benefits, and it is reasonable to omit adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in appropriately selected older adult patients is supported by both the LACE meta-analysis and an unplanned subset analysis of the JBR.10 trial (which was one of the trials included in the meta-analysis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. It should be noted, however, that fewer than 10 percent of the patients in LACE were over 70 years of age and that two of the three positive studies excluded patients older than 75 years, illustrating that trials are limited in assessing this population. The LACE meta-analysis demonstrated that efficacy was not significantly different in older (&ge;70 years) compared with younger patients, even though older patients received lower doses and fewer cycles of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, no differences in severe toxicity were observed. Similarly, in JBR.10, patients &gt;65 years received fewer cycles of chemotherapy (median, three versus four cycles in those &le;65 years) but experienced an overall survival benefit that was similar to that observed in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Neither of these analyses can be generalized to assess the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in the broader population of older patients, since patients enrolled in the adjuvant chemotherapy trials represent a group that was likely more fit than those of similar age who were not enrolled. Therefore, decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in the older adult patient must be individualized according to patient functional status. Special considerations for the use of chemotherapy in older adult patients are discussed separately.

Additionally, those with superior sulcus tumors or chest wall invasion in the setting of N1 nodal involvement are often treated neoadjuvantly. The selection and management of patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H427873351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Mediastinal (N2, N3) involvement'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H116383941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Chemoradiotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Superior pulmonary sulcus (Pancoast) tumors&quot;, section on 'Induction chemoradiotherapy plus surgery'</a>.)</p><p>For patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, the selection of neoadjuvant regimen follows the same principles as in the adjuvant setting.

This is based on data from the Lung Adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cisplatin</a> Evaluation (LACE) meta-analysis discussed above, demonstrating decreased risk of death with cisplatin-based regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2996525635\"><span class=\"h3\">Cisplatin-based doublets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the LACE meta-analysis were inadequate to establish the optimal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> regimen. Our approach is to pair with cisplatin a third-generation cytotoxic agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a> for those with nonsquamous histology, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinorelbine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinorelbine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> for those with squamous histology. A choice among these agents depends on the side effect profile and patient and provider preferences. Vinorelbine has been the most studied agent, but is associated with neuropathy as well as the greatest incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Furthermore, it requires central intravenous access due to its vesicant properties. Docetaxel causes alopecia and has a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia than gemcitabine, and is also associated with pneumonitis and hypersensitivity reactions (for which steroid premedication is necessary). Gemcitabine is associated with thrombocytopenia. Pemetrexed is commonly chosen for those with nonsquamous histology given that it has the lowest incidence of febrile neutropenia and is not associated with alopecia or neuropathy.</p><p>The E1505 trial randomly assigned approximately 1500 patients with completely resected NSCLC to treatment with a cisplatin-based doublet with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>. Investigators were permitted to choose between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinorelbine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinorelbine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> for squamous histology, or any of these three agents or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a> for those with nonsquamous histology. Each chemotherapy regimen led to similar overall survival (either with or without bevacizumab) in a preliminary report, although this study was not powered to detect differences in survival between the doublets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Vinorelbine was associated with a higher rate of neutropenia (57 percent) and febrile neutropenia (13 percent), and gemcitabine was associated with greater thrombocytopenia (18 percent), than other doublets. For nonsquamous histologies, pemetrexed was associated with less total grade 3 to 5 toxicity than other chemotherapy groups (64 percent versus 74 to 83 percent).</p><p>Although the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> to a chemotherapy doublet is associated with improved overall survival, there was no benefit in the E1505 trial from the addition of bevacizumab to a chemotherapy doublet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At a median follow-up of 50 months, overall survival was not increased (median, 86 months with bevacizumab versus not reached without bevacizumab; hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.82-1.19).
