The distribution of male and female causes among infertile couples has not been well defined. In a 1982 to 1985 World Health Organization (WHO) multicenter study, 20 percent of cases were attributed to male factors, 38 percent to female factors, 27 percent had causal factors identified in both partners, and 15 percent could not be satisfactorily attributed to either partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is essential that the female partner be thoroughly investigated and treated while the male partner is being evaluated. Problems in the female partner, such as anovulation or irregular ovulation, endometriosis, and tubal obstruction, should be simultaneously addressed with or before treatment of the male partner. Treatment of the female partner can often compensate for male factor subfertility and result in pregnancy without treatment of the male.

Many medical and surgical procedures have been reported to improve male fertility only to be shown subsequently to be ineffective. The two principal reasons for the large number of initially promising, but ultimately misleading, reports are the use of semen quality, instead of pregnancy, as the criterion of success and the failure to include a control group in the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2813194680\"><span class=\"h3\">Is the patient hypogonadal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is helpful in determination of the potential role of medical therapy to restore fertility in the small minority of men whose infertility is due to secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism. Assessment of this axis is also important to identify the subset of men that have combined deficiencies of sperm and testosterone production. Men with testosterone deficiency may benefit from testosterone replacement therapy, but it is important to recognize that testosterone therapy will <strong>suppress</strong> spermatogenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between primary (hypergonadotropic) and secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism is important because medical therapy might be useful in restoring fertility in men with secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism, but it will not be useful in primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism. Men with primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism generally require assisted reproductive technology (ART) such as surgical testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) into the female partner's egg in order to conceive children. (See <a href=\"#H3142363178\" class=\"local\">'Assisted reproductive technologies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2295239941\" class=\"local\">'Retrieval of sperm'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4046538618\"><span class=\"h3\">Eugonadal, infertile men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eugonadal, infertile men (with normal serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], and luteinizing hormone [LH] concentrations) might have causes that can be treated surgically to enhance or restore fertility (eg, surgical excision of a large varicocele or surgical correction of ejaculatory duct obstruction). However, eugonadal, infertile men, like men with primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism, often must be treated with ART in order to conceive. (See <a href=\"#H2254926830\" class=\"local\">'Surgical repair of varicocele'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2978784862\" class=\"local\">'Obstruction of epididymis or ejaculatory duct'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3142363178\" class=\"local\">'Assisted reproductive technologies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3093032378\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of assisted reproductive technologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of ART has allowed many couples with male factor infertility to conceive. Because ART may be effective in any man with evidence of spermatogenesis (even microscopic nests of sperm visible only on testicular histology, eg, in men with Klinefelter syndrome), ART may useful in the treatment of many causes of male infertility. Thus, we discuss ART in a separate section from categorical causes of male infertility.

Treatment of the underlying endocrine or systemic disorder may result in eugonadism and improved spermatogenesis and fertility. If treatment of the underlying endocrine or systemic disorder does not normalize serum testosterone and improve spermatogenesis and fertility, then gonadotropin replacement therapy might be beneficial.</p><p>For example, if a man with a prolactin-secreting macroadenoma has persistent secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism and azoospermia 6 to 12 months after appropriate treatment of the prolactin macroadenoma, gonadotropin replacement therapy should be considered if conception is desired. In this example, the underlying pituitary disease has induced hypogonadotropism that is unlikely to resolve.

Secondary hypogonadism is present if the serum testosterone concentration is low and serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations are low or inappropriately normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Normal spermatogenesis takes approximately three months. As a result, a rise in sperm concentrations, as measured by semen analysis, usually does not occur for at least three and sometimes six months or more with any medical treatment of secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism. With effective treatment of secondary hypogonadism, time to conception may occur within six months, but may take two or more years. Induction of spermatogenesis in men with secondary hypogonadism is reviewed in detail separately.

Lowering the serum prolactin concentration and shrinking the adenoma in this setting may not be sufficient to increase the testosterone concentration and sperm count. Thus, if the serum testosterone concentration does not increase to normal within 6 to 12 months of the serum prolactin being reduced to normal, gonadotropin replacement treatment should be instituted if fertility is desired.

The results depend on site of the obstruction and the experience and skill of the operator.

ART with intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) that has been retrieved from the ejaculate, epididymis, or testis has allowed some infertile men to conceive (eg, men with azoospermia and men with immotile sperm).</p><p>However, ART does not improve rates of live births for all types of male infertility. In a meta-analysis of 10 trials of in vitro fertilization (IVF), ICSI, and intrauterine insemination for couples with male infertility (abnormal sperm parameters), there were no differences in pregnancy or live birth rates between ART and expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

IVF describes any process where an egg is fertilized by a sperm outside of the human body. IVF with ICSI has revolutionized the treatment of male factor infertility. This technique involves the direct injection of a single spermatozoon into the cytoplasm of a human oocyte, usually obtained from follicles produced under controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracytoplasmic sperm injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If sperm is retrievable from the male partner, the usual overall fertilization rate of ICSI is approximately 60 percent, and the clinical pregnancy rate per cycle is approximately 20 percent, while the multiple pregnancy rate is approximately 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].

ICSI can also be performed successfully using spermatozoa that are obtained from testicular aspiration or biopsies. Many men with nonobstructive azoospermia will have isolated regions of spermatogenesis within the testis; sperm can be retrieved in many men with nonobstructive azoospermia, including men with Klinefelter syndrome and men with longstanding azoospermia after chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/5,51-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,51-61</a>].</p><p>Men undergoing systemic chemotherapy should be considered for referral for sperm banking and sperm cryopreservation; cryopreservation of ejaculated sperm before initiation of chemotherapy ensures higher-quality sperm for ART and avoids surgical sperm retrieval later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of cytotoxic agents on gonadal function in adult men&quot;, section on 'Semen cryopreservation'</a>.)</p><p>ICSI success is dependent on retrieving adequate numbers of spermatozoa or spermatids from the biopsies. Successful pregnancy has been reported even with injection of fresh or cryopreserved immature sperm cells, such as elongated and round spermatids but not with spermatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Surgical techniques for retrieval of sperm from the testes include testicular or epididymal aspiration (which can be done with local anesthesia) or multiple open testicular biopsies with testicular sperm extraction (TESE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. TESE is more likely to retrieve sperm for ICSI than testicular aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A modified form of TESE, microTESE, involves microdissection of the testis; using microscopic dissection to identify nests of isolated spermatogenesis to extract with open biopsies is even more effective than TESE for sperm retrieval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations may be useful in determining the choice of testicular extraction technique. Higher serum FSH concentrations and smaller testicular volumes generally correlate with impairment of spermatogenesis, and a high serum FSH concentration in a man with azoospermia predicts low probability of retrieving sperm with testicular aspiration or TESE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-male-infertility/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].
