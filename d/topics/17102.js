In some African countries, the prevalence exceeds 20 percent. More than half of the HIV-infected population in sub-Saharan Africa is women and children. The HIV prevalence in Southeast Asia is substantially lower (0.6 percent), representing approximately four million HIV-infected people living in this under-resourced region. In Latin America and the Caribbean, infection rates vary by region, with estimated prevalences ranging from 0.5 to 2 percent. Markedly high rates of infection exist within certain risk groups, such as men who have sex with men, prisoners, commercial sex workers, and injection drug users.

Those with advanced HIV disease (clinical stage 3 or 4 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55105\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55105 \">table 1</a>)) or a CD4 cell count of &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> are a priority for ART initiation.

Mounting evidence has suggested that initiation of ART early during infection (even at CD4 cell counts higher than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> which was the previously recommended threshold for initiation) is also beneficial in resource-limited settings. (See <a href=\"#H630998111\" class=\"local\">'Optimal timing of antiretroviral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Of note, these recommendations apply only to individuals infected with HIV-1. The use of ART in patients with HIV-2 infection is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hiv-2-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of HIV-2 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5747663\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for and management of treatment failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment failure is defined as a persistent HIV viral load &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> over three months after at least six months of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If HIV RNA testing is not easily available, treatment failure should be indirectly assessed through CD4 cell count and clinical monitoring, with targeted viral load testing used as a confirmatory test when available. (See <a href=\"#H8959141\" class=\"local\">'ART-efficacy'</a> below.) </p><p>Genotypic testing is not readily accessible in many resource-limited settings. Thus, second-line regimens following treatment failure must often be chosen without knowledge of the presence of resistance mutations in the patient&rsquo;s virus. WHO recommends a boosted protease inhibitor plus at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) as a second line regimen. The preferred protease inhibitors are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a> and ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a>. The NRTIs used in the second-line regimen should be informed by the NRTIs used in the failing first-line regimen. As an example, if tenofovir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> were used in the first-line regimen, the second-line NRTIs should be <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>. Despite concerns that failure on an NRTI-containing regimen would lead to cross-resistance to and thus decreased efficacy with other NRTI agents, NRTI-containing second-line regimens appear to maintain efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In a systematic review of studies and surveillance reports of antiretroviral resistance in resource-limited settings, the prevalence of genotypes with at least one drug resistance mutation increased to 3.7 and 7.4 percent in southern and east Africa, respectively, over the five to nine years following rollout of national ART programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations were most common. Three other studies from sub-Saharan Africa found that the most prevalent genotypic mutations included the M184V mutation (conferring resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>), K103N (which confers resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>) or K65R (conferring resistance to tenofovir) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/146-148\" class=\"abstract_t\">146-148</a>]. </p><p>Among patients treated with a first-line ART regimen, the risk of drug resistance in the setting of virologic failure may be considerable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/149-152\" class=\"abstract_t\">149-152</a>]. In a multi-center cohort study in sub-Saharan Africa, of the 142 patients who were not virologically suppressed on first-line ART at 12 months, 70 percent had at least one resistance mutation and 49 percent harbored resistance to two classes of antiretrovirals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. In a separate study from South Africa, 23 percent of 226 patients failing a first-line regimen harbored complex resistance patterns that predicted cross-resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which could decrease the efficacy of an empirically chosen second-line regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. In a global surveillance study, tenofovir resistance was found in 57 percent of patients failing first-line regimen containing tenofovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].</p><p>However, at least one study suggested that NRTIs retain important efficacy in a second-line regimen despite prior high levels of NRTI resistance. Specifically, in trial from sub-Saharan Africa, 1277 HIV-infected individuals who had failed treatment with a first-line regimen of an NNRTI plus two NRTIs were randomly assigned to subsequent treatment with a boosted protease inhibitor plus two or three clinician-chosen NRTIs, a boosted protease inhibitor plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a>, or boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy (after three months of combination therapy with raltegravir) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At 96 weeks, viral load &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> was achieved in 88 and 87 percent of the patients in the NRTI and raltegravir groups, respectively, but only 67 percent in the protease inhibitor monotherapy group.</p><p>Among patients treated with second-line ART, the risk of drug resistance may be different. In a study from South Africa of 43 HIV-infected patients with confirmed virologic failure on second-line ART, 67 percent still had wild-type virus. This finding suggests that poor adherence instead of resistance was contributing to failure and may be a result of the different genetic barriers to resistance for protease inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The increased availability of generic drugs in Guyana, Haiti, Vietnam, and 13 African countries has led to increased procurement of monthly medication packs (from 6 million in 2005 to 22 million in 2008) and to an estimated cost savings of more than 323 million dollars over a four-year period (2005 to 2008) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. Cost issues are becoming increasingly important with the demonstration that initiation of therapy earlier in the course of disease results in improved clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of prioritizing the choice and timing of ART regimens.</p><p>Another challenge is to expand effective treatment to patients who cannot tolerate first-line regimens because of either toxicity or virologic failure and resistance. Second-line regimens are now available in many countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>], although at considerable increased cost (up to five times that of first-line medications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. Cost-effective algorithms to guide regimen changes for treatment failure remain a subject of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/107,159\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,159</a>].</p><p>Concerns regarding funding for international ART programs persist, and debate continues regarding allocation of resources and use of available funds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/160,161\" class=\"abstract_t\">160,161</a>].

As a result, a stable amount of PEPfAR funding is available to continue ART for patients already enrolled in ART programs, as well as to initiate ART for patients now eligible or just presenting.

The benefit of ART is substantial even at high CD4 cell counts. Successful ART for infected individuals also reduces the risk of transmission.
