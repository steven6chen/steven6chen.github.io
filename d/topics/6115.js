This type of abnormal connection can form after a person has surgery, but it can happen without surgery in some cases, too. The two more common types of enteric fistula are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enterocutaneous fistula &ndash; This is an abnormal connection between the intestine and the skin. It is a serious condition that sometimes needs to be treated in the hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Entero-entero fistula &ndash; This is an abnormal connection between one part of the intestines and another. The abnormal connection can be between small intestine and small intestine, small intestine and large intestine, or large intestine and large intestine.</p><p/><p>Enteric fistulas can also cause abnormal connections with other body parts, such as the uterus, bladder, or blood vessels. Those are less common and their symptoms and treatments are different from those of enteric fistulas described here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19859567\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of enteric fistula?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the type of fistula involved.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enterocutaneous fistulas can cause leakage of the intestines through an opening on the skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Entero-entero fistulas can cause a swollen, tender belly, fever or diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19859582\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for enteric fistula?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. But you might need tests that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan &ndash; This is a special kind of X-ray.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fistulogram &ndash; For this test, the doctor injects a dye into one opening in the fistula and then takes an X-ray to see where it goes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67107525\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an enteric fistula treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids and medicines that go into a vein through a tube called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) to help drain any fluid collections or areas of infection</p><p/><p>Some people need surgery to repair a fistula.</p><p><strong>More on this topic</strong></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectovaginal-fistula-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rectovaginal fistula (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-abscess-and-fistula-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anal abscess and fistula (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
