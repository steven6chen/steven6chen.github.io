Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of widow spider bites, recluse spider bites, and an overview of the approach to a suspected spider bite are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites#H19715450\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of widow spider bites&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p>Patients with moderate to severe envenomations by black widow spiders warrant parenteral opioid analgesia and benzodiazepines along with monitoring for complications. Antivenom is also indicated when muscle pain and spasms are poorly controlled by these measures. (See <a href=\"#H4466406\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe envenomation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2370648\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with persistent severe pain despite parenteral medications who do not receive or do not respond to widow spider antivenom warrant hospitalization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">MILD ENVENOMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain at the bite site with no migration or other systemic symptoms identifies local widow spider envenomations.

However, local swelling is usually minimal, and these treatments do not have any other known benefit for widow spider envenomation.

However, it is also associated with allergic reactions, serum sickness, and rare reports of fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1,5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-10</a>]. Widow spider envenomation is usually not life threatening although mortality associated with secondary infection of the bite site or heart failure has been rarely described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In the United States, <em>Latrodectus mactans</em> antivenom is in short supply and distribution is limited by the manufacturer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>The indications, efficacy, and adverse effects of widow spider antivenoms are discussed below.

Intravenous calcium does <strong>not</strong> appear to be effective for the treatment of moderate to severe muscle pain and spasms after a widow spider bite. As an example, in an observational study of 163 patients with widow spider bites, 23 of 24 (96 percent) moderately or severely envenomated patients had no relief of muscle pain and spasms after intravenous calcium therapy and required other treatment (parenteral opioids, benzodiazepines, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antivenom) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2370618\"><span class=\"h2\">Widow spider antivenoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widow spider bites are rarely life threatening, although envenomation can cause significant pain and require hospitalization. Among patients with moderate to severe envenomation unresponsive to supportive care, antivenom appears to reduce the pain, have a more prolonged effect than analgesics, and can reduce the need for hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p>Several widow spider antivenoms are commercially available, including the American black widow spider (<em>L. mactans</em>) antivenom, the Antivenin Latrodectus (Black Widow) equine immune F(ab)2 produced in Mexico, and the Australian redback spider (<em>L. hasselti</em>) antivenom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. There is sufficient chemical similarity among widow venoms that all widow antivenoms provide some degree of relief following bites of various widow spiders. As an example, case reports describe successful use of redback antivenom in treating the bites of both the false black widow and the American southern black widow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>In the United States, <em>Latrodectus mactans</em> antivenom is in short supply and distribution is limited by the manufacturer to patients with symptomatic bites (call the Merck national Service Center Call Line at 1-800-672-6372) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/13,14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,19</a>]. </p><p>A new antivenom consisting of horse F(ab)2 fragments is undergoing trials but is not available outside of experimental protocols. </p><p>In areas of the world in which redback spiders are prevalent, it is a routinely-stocked antivenom. Currently, in Australia, more redback spider antivenom is used than all other antivenoms, including snake antivenoms, combined. (See <a href=\"#H2370648\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2370648\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We strongly encourage consultation with a medical toxicologist, clinical toxinologist or other physician with experience in managing widow spider bites prior to antivenom administration. Phone consultation with a medical toxicologist is available through a United States regional poison control center by calling 1-800-222-1222. In Australia, expert advice can be obtained through the poisons information system by calling 13 11 26 or through the clinical toxinology service in Adelaide by calling 08-81617000. For clinicians outside of the United States and Australia, the World Health Organization provides a listing of international poison centers at its website: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6510\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>.</p><p>We suggest that Australian redback spider antivenom be administered for moderate to severe symptoms of redback spider bites that are unresponsive to parenteral opioid and benzodiazepine therapy. Representative symptoms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe and persistent local pain or muscle cramping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant pain or diaphoresis extending beyond the immediate site of the bite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia and hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p>We also suggest that American <a href=\"topic.htm?path=black-widow-spider-latrodectus-mactans-antivenom-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">black widow spider antivenom</a> be administered to patients with moderate to severe manifestations of envenomation that are not responsive to supportive care. However, this antivenom is in short supply and distribution is limited by the manufacturer. </p><p>Clinicians must weigh the risks and benefits of antivenoms in each case. The current recommendations for treatment of widow bites with antivenom are based upon case reports, retrospective series, and small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/2,5,6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,20,21</a>]. Widow spider antivenom administration can decrease pain duration to less than 24 hours in up to 80 percent of recipients and decrease severity to the point that discharge home is possible in up to 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1,5,6,8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6,8,15</a>]. However, their use is also associated with allergic reactions (5 to 9 percent of patients), anaphylaxis (&lt;1 percent of patients) and, for American <a href=\"topic.htm?path=black-widow-spider-latrodectus-mactans-antivenom-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">black widow spider antivenom</a> (<em>Latrodectus mactans</em>) rare reports of fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1,5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-10</a>]. Serum sickness has been described in 2 to 16 percent of patients who have received widow spider antivenoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/6,7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,21</a>]. However, the frequency of serum sickness was not significantly different between patients who initially received antivenom when compared to placebo in one multicenter trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This finding suggests that envenomation itself may account for a significant proportion of the serum sickness that occurs after severe widow spider bites although confirmation of this finding in additional studies with larger sample sizes is necessary to confirm this finding. (See <a href=\"#H2370677\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p>Adherence to this recommendation will likely result in a minority of patients receiving widow antivenom. As an example, a retrospective review of antivenom use in Australia over a two-year period reported that redback spider antivenom was administered in about 20 percent of cases that presented for medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Furthermore, additional trials that directly evaluate antivenom therapy versus supportive care alone are needed to better define which patients should receive widow spider antivenoms. (See <a href=\"#H2371971\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2370677\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.) </p><p>There is a clear difference in approach to treatment of latrodectism in different parts of the world:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In North America, due to concerns about <em>Latrodectus mactans </em>antivenom safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], antivenom is primarily used in severe to life-threatening envenomation, which will result in patients with moderate symptoms suffering for a period of several days. In the United States, <em>Latrodectus mactans</em> antivenom is in short supply and distribution is limited by the manufacturer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The clinician should contact a regional poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to discuss whether antivenom administration is warranted and to assist with obtaining it from the manufacturer (Merck &amp; Co., Inc. 1-800-672-6372). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Australia, redback spider antivenom is used as treatment in a significant number of cases of latrodectism that do not fully respond to a trial of analgesia, depending upon local hospital treatment protocols. Observational data indicate approximately 1000 patients receive this antivenom each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There are no confirmed fatalities from adverse reactions to the antivenom, suggesting that this antivenom is safe. (See <a href=\"#H2370677\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5682553\"><span class=\"h4\">Pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Black widow antivenom has a category C (risk cannot be ruled out) pregnancy drug rating.

Thus, the indications for use in pregnant women are the same as for other moderate to severely envenomated patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371971\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence regarding widow spider antivenom effectiveness is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>American black widow spider (</strong><strong><em>Latrodectus mactans</em></strong><strong>) antivenom</strong> &ndash; American <a href=\"topic.htm?path=black-widow-spider-latrodectus-mactans-antivenom-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">black widow spider antivenom</a> administered after <em>L. Mactans</em> envenomation significantly reduced the duration of all symptoms in one series of 58 treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in a mean time of 31 minutes after antivenom administration. The mean total duration of symptoms was 9 hours in patients receiving antivenom, compared with 22 hours in patients not receiving this intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Admission rates were 12 and 52 percent in those receiving antivenom and controls, respectively. Another case series reported similar outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Australian redback spider antivenom (</strong><strong><em>Latrodectus hasselti</em></strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; The evidence suggests that Australian redback spider antivenom is efficacious for the relief of acute pain after envenomation with <em>L. hasselti</em>, although the degree of benefit and the proportion of patients achieving adequate pain relief is inconsistent. The largest and only placebo-controlled trial suggests that on the order of 10 percent more adult patients experience short-term improvement in pain with antivenom versus placebo (number needed to treat 10), with no difference in resolution of systemic symptoms or reduction in pain at 4 or 24 hours when compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, much larger treatment effects are reported in other trials and observational reports, and these same reports support a significant reduction of pain over 24 hours and decreased need for hospital admission among those patients who receive antivenom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/5,6,8,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8,27,28</a>]. In our view, the body of evidence supports the continued use of antivenom for Australian redback spider bites in selected patients as determined by local guidelines as discussed in greater detail below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of greater efficacy and safety, we support the administration of Australian redback spider antivenom by the intravenous (IV) route. Intramuscular (IM) administration may be appropriate if IV access cannot be readily achieved. In one large observational study IM redback antivenom was 94 percent effective in reducing pain symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The intravenous route may be effective in patients who have not responded fully to intramuscular injection and appears safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The intravenous route has traditionally been preferred for patients with severe systemic symptoms and for children younger than 12 years. Clinical experience and animal studies have suggested that intravenous use may be more efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Available evidence indicates IM absorption of antivenom, as measured by intravascular levels. Furthermore, IV access permits more rapid treatment of significant allergic reactions. There is a discernible shift in use amongst emergency physicians towards IV administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relative efficacy of IV or IM Australian redback spider antivenom administration for relief of pain after moderate or severe envenomation has been examined in small multicenter randomized trials with varying results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/5,6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,21</a>]. Differences in benefit range from 50 percent more patients achieving full pain relief at 24 hours after receiving IV antivenom rather than IM antivenom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] to no apparent clinically important difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the only trial to compare antivenom to placebo (RAVE2), 10 percent more patients had reduction in pain at two hours, although this result was not statistically significant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a separate trial in which all participants received antivenom, 20 percent of patients still required opioid analgesia after emergency department discharge and were unable to sleep in the first 24 hours following envenomation because of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the investigators of the only placebo-controlled trial of antivenom for Australian redback spider envenomation have concluded that it is ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], we feel that this conclusion is premature for the following reasons:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Almost half of patients had received no analgesia prior to randomization and treatment and approximately one-quarter to one-third had pain scores of 5 or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some of these patients may have had mild envenomation which would not have typically warranted antivenom treatment.

Although a trial of several premedication regimens prior to Indian snake antivenom administration, found a marked decrease in severe reactions for patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], this snake antivenom has a much higher rate of adverse reactions when compared to widow spider antivenoms (75 versus 11 percent, respectively). Thus, unless there are clear, patient specific reasons for providing premedication (eg, known prior allergic reaction to widow spider antivenom), we do not advise it for patients receiving widow spider antivenoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Widow spider antivenoms may be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM, eg, in the lateral thigh). The initial dose of antivenom will vary depending on the product used. Clinicians should be guided by a poison control center, medical toxicologist, clinical toxinologist, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> information provided by the manufacturer. As with all other antivenoms, if used intravenously, secure IV access must first be established, the antivenom should be diluted, and then given either by slow &quot;push&quot; or continuous infusion, with the clinician present throughout administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dose of antivenom is determined by expected venom dose, not the size of the patient; children should receive the same dose as adults, for a given level of envenoming. However, sometimes large adults may fail to respond adequately to a standard dose initially, for reasons which are unclear, and a higher dose is worth considering in this setting, tailored to individual clinical circumstances. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=black-widow-spider-latrodectus-mactans-antivenom-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Black widow spider antivenom</a> &ndash; The initial dose of black widow spider antivenom (Antivenin <em>Latrodectus mactans</em> equine) is 6000 antivenom units (equal to the entire contents of one reconstituted vial). The black widow (<em>Latrodectus mactans</em>) antivenom available in the United States is freeze dried and should be reconstituted in the 2.5 mL sterile diluent that is supplied. For intravenous administration in adults and children, we suggest further diluting the solution by adding it to 250 mL of normal saline. We administer this initially at 1 mL per minute for 15 minutes, with careful observation for signs of an allergic reaction (flushing, hives, itching, bronchospasm, etc). If this initial administration is tolerated, we complete the infusion over 1 hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/9,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,38</a>].

If response is not complete or symptoms begin to return, then a second dose of two vials may be given one or more hours after the first; it is common practice to wait at least 2 hours before considering a second or subsequent dose. A third dose of two vials may be given, although the diagnosis of widow spider bite should be reconsidered if there has been no response by the second or third dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
