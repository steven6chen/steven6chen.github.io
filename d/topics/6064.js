Fortunately, complications due to cholelithiasis, such as cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and pancreatitis, are relatively uncommon, and in many cases can be managed conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Although there are no precise estimates of the incidence, several reports have found that biliary tract disease (most commonly cholecystitis) represented one of the most frequent indications for non-obstetrical surgery during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>A subset of patients requires endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), most commonly for choledocholithiasis or presumed gallstone pancreatitis. Opinions regarding the safety of ERCP during pregnancy differ in various reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. Major concerns surround issues related to radiation exposure to the fetus and the risk of the procedure on pregnancy outcome.</p><p>A general principle in the care of women with an acute biliary tract disorder during pregnancy is to provide the most conservative management possible with the hope of delaying intervention until after pregnancy or until the second trimester, when surgical intervention is relatively safest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H142702111\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few ERCP-related complications to the mother or fetus have been reported. Data on safety of ERCP in pregnancy are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A literature review described complications that were reported during a total of 64 ERCPs performed during pregnancy (mostly described in case series of one to four patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/11,16-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16-38</a>]. Of these procedures, 14 were done in the first trimester, 23 in the second, 19 in the third, and 8 unspecified. Therapeutic procedures included 56 sphincterotomies. Of 47 pregnancies that were followed to term, there were two premature births. Conservative treatment of a type I choledochal cyst resulted in cyst rupture at 18 weeks of gestation with subsequent peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Spontaneous abortion of the fetus occurred after surgery. A patient with a pancreatic pseudocyst who underwent diagnostic ERCP before EUS-guided cyst-gastrostomy has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The median fluoroscopy time was 1.45 minutes. Almost all patients underwent a therapeutic procedure. Post-ERCP pancreatitis developed in 11 patients (16 percent), none of whom had a severe course. Most patients achieved a term pregnancy (89 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series of 23 patients included 20 of who underwent a therapeutic ERCP while three underwent a diagnostic ERCP only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One patient developed post ERCP pancreatitis (after each of her three ERCPs). There was one spontaneous abortion (three weeks after ERCP) and one neonatal death 26 hours after delivery. The neonatal death and post-ERCP pancreatitis were in the same patient who had undergone three ERCPs (twice during the first and once during the third trimesters) with pancreatic duct stenting for stenosis of pancreatic orifice after a previous surgical sphincteroplasty. She was also not known to be pregnant at the time of the first ERCP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series described long-term follow-up of 18 pregnant women who underwent biliary sphincterotomy for CBD stones during pregnancy (first trimester 4, second 6, third 8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Despite short-term complications (one with postsphincterotomy bleed, one with mild post-ERCP pancreatitis and preterm labor), no long-term complications were seen after a median of six years (range 1 to 11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 15 patients, the incidence of complications (7 percent) was no different than the rate of complications observed in nonpregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There were no serious adverse outcomes to the fetus or mother.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective matched-cohort study collected data from the National Inpatient Sample compared ERCP data from 907 pregnant women and 2721 non-pregnant women. Rates of perforation, infection, and bleeding were similar in both groups. However, the rates of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) were higher in pregnant women as compared with controls (12 versus 5 percent). Pregnancy was an independent risk factor for PEP (adjusted odds ratio 2.8, 95 percent CI 2.1-3.8). The risk of PEP was higher among community hospitals as compared with teaching centers (2.5; 95% CI, 1.6-3.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Limitations of the study are included the lack of clinically useful prognostic indicators of disease severity and acuity and potential variability in assignment of secondary international classification of disease codes for comorbidities which may affect outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE RADIATION RISK TO THE FETUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The perceived risk of radiation exposure is much greater than the actual risk, but a full explanation of these risks to the woman and her family is more credible if given prior to the exposure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>).

Intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done in patients thought to have an intermediate probability of a retained bile duct stone.

Three out of 23 patients in the largest series were not known to be pregnant at the time of ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Consider other imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is considered safe in pregnancy and does not need paramagnetic contrast agents such as gadolinium, which is known to cross the placenta. However, MRCP is less sensitive than ERCP for detecting stones &lt;6 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Another alternative is endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), which is highly sensitive (88 to 97 percent) and specific (96 to 100 percent) for choledocholithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Background population risks for miscarriage, congenital anomalies, genetic disease, and growth restriction are approximately 20, 4, 10, and 10 percent, respectively. Potential radiation exposure risks to the fetus can be divided into four categories: intrauterine fetal death, malformations, and disturbances of growth and development, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>). A discussion of strategies that might be used to minimize radiation exposure is also imperative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Choose a highly-experienced endoscopist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Highly experienced biliary endoscopists should ideally perform the procedure for two reasons. The greatest risk to the fetus is probably severe maternal pancreatitis, the risk of which can be reduced when ERCP is performed by a highly skilled endoscopist. Even in tertiary centers, endoscopists deal with pregnant women and their biliary and pancreatic disorders infrequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Endoscopists who perform a low volume of ERCPs should consider referring these patients to higher volume centers unless the clinical urgency would preclude such a transfer (such as in patient's cholangitis or obstructive jaundice). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoid fluoroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though the fetus can be shielded, efforts should be made to avoid performing ERCP during the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. While harmful effects of radiation exposure are unlikely to develop below a certain threshold of radiation dose, the threshold associated with a risk of childhood cancers such as leukemia is not known precisely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ERCP without fluoroscopy has been reported but its safety is not established. The largest series to describe this approach used the following approach in 21 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Endoscopist-controlled wire-guided cannulation was first attempted; the cannula was not advanced into the duct unless the endoscopist was confident that the bile duct had been cannulated, as assessed by the presence of bile flowing around the wire from the papillary orifice. Once biliary cannulation was confirmed, a standard wire-guided biliary sphincterotomy was performed using the papillotome.</p><p>When bile was not seen flowing around the guidewire, instead of advancing the catheter to aspirate fluid, a 5F 2 cm stent was inserted over the wire and the drainage from the stent was observed. The color of draining fluid was used to assess whether the stent was in the bile duct (yellow) or the pancreatic duct (clear). If the stent revealed bile flow, a stent-guided biliary sphincterotomy using a needle-knife was performed. Cannulation was then attempted using a guidewire, which had been previously inserted into the needle-knife. The stent was removed after extending the biliary sphincterotomy. There was one case of mild post-ERCP pancreatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraprocedural interventions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Medicines used in ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications that may be used during ERCP, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (Category D), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> (Category B), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (Category C), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (Category B) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> (Category B), are thought to be generally safe in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Patients were placed supine on the fluoroscopy table, and the lower abdomen and pelvis shielded with a 0.5- to 1.0-mm thickness of lead or its equivalent. The uterus was positioned outside the primary radiograph beam.</p><p>Four pairs of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were taped to the skin: one pair on the abdomen over the uterus shielded by lead, one pair on the upper abdomen in the primary beam, one pair on the lower back beneath the uterus shielded by lead, and one pair on the upper back in the primary beam. Fluoroscopy was performed at 75 kVp. The TLDs were calibrated at 75 kVp. A TLD reader (Harshaw-3000; Filtrol, Solon, Ohio) was used to read the TLDs; readings were converted into milliRad of dose received at the skin surface by using a calibration curve.</p><p>The TLDs on the upper back in the primary beam recorded the highest dose; 10 percent of this dose was estimated to be the fetal dose. The fetus was considered to be 10 cm from the posterior surface, and percentage depth dose at 10 cm was taken as approximately 10 percent. The depth dose will vary with both body habitus and gestational age, and, thus, the dose estimate is an approximation.</p><p>Stochastic effects of radiation do not exhibit any threshold dose. For this reason, European Society of Digestive Endoscopy guidelines recommend that the kerma-area product should be monitored, and its cumulative value should be recorded for every ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. One study argued that measuring fetal radiation exposure data by TLD was unnecessary. They reported data on 35 therapeutic ERCPs in pregnant patients with techniques to minimize fluoroscopy time. For the majority of the women (88.6 percent), the estimated fetal radiation exposure was no more than 0.0002 Gy; only one woman's estimated fetal radiation exposure was greater than 0.0005 Gy. The fetal radiation exposure values were below the threshold of 0.01 Gy established by the International Commission of Radiological Protections. It should be noted that their mean fluoroscopy time was 14 seconds. The threshold may be exceeded in longer procedures, and it is difficult to predict the duration and difficulty prior to the procedure. In addition, the assumption that 10 percent of the dose recorded by TLDs on the upper back was the fetal dose may not always be accurate since gestational age and physical features of the mother could dramatically influence these values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Generous sphincterotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If indicated, a generous sphincterotomy is reasonable to avoid the possibility of an impacted stone especially if minimum fluoroscopy is used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid pancreatic endotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic endotherapy generally requires relatively lengthy fluoroscopy time, can be technically challenging, and may be associated with increased risk. As a result, it should preferentially be avoided unless absolutely indicated. A case series described two patients with pancreatic disease who underwent pancreatic endotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One patient with pancreas divisum underwent minor papilla sphincterotomy and stent placement. The other underwent three ERCPs with pancreatic duct stenting, complicated by mild post-ERCP pancreatitis. Neonatal death occurred with the infant dying 26 hours after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Precut papillotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precut papillotomy using a needle knife approach has been performed during pregnancy, allowing for removal of an impacted common bile duct stone without the need for fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/12,22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22,32</a>] or for cutting of a minor papillotomy over a stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Despite the potential benefit on reducing fluoroscopy time, the indications for a precut papillotomy during pregnancy should probably be the same as in nonpregnant patients.

Stent occlusion or migration can easily precipitate cholangitis and in addition a second procedure is needed to remove the stent. However, sphincterotomy alone may not be sufficient to maintain biliary decompression, especially in patients in whom cholecystectomy will be delayed until after the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/19,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,55</a>].</p><p>By contrast, others have demonstrated that marked reductions in fluoroscopy time (0.1 min to confirm guidewire position) can be achieved by foregoing precise diagnostic information and performing a palliative therapeutic procedure such as placement of a stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/31,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,42</a>]. This is especially important when informed consent discussions with the patient sometimes place the highest priority on the minimization of fetal radiation exposure based upon patient preference.

In the nonpregnant setting (where greater numbers of patients have been evaluated) expectant management following sphincterotomy has been associated with up to a 50 percent risk of a recurrent gallstone-related complication within two years.

Thus, whether the benefit of a relatively conservative approach (ie, sphincterotomy without cholecystectomy) is justified by a sufficiently low risk of recurrence (and particularly a severe recurrence) of gallstone related complications is not straightforward.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Is sphincterotomy needed in patients without choledocholithiasis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A similar controversy surrounds whether endoscopic sphincterotomy is warranted in patients with gallstone pancreatitis who do not have choledocholithiasis at ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,20</a>].

It must be acknowledged, however, that the benefit of this approach is uncertain since gallstones and sludge frequently resolve following pregnancy. The benefit would appear to be most clear cut in women who desire additional pregnancies. While reports suggest that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be safely performed throughout gestation, it is preferable to do surgery during the second or early third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-in-pregnancy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].
