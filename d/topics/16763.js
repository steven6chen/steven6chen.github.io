The peak onset is between the ages of 30 and 50. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As of 1971, only 12 cases of pregnancy in women with SSc had been reported. Mortality among these patients was alarmingly high: four patients died (three from renal and pulmonary disease and one from a postpartum viral infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence of pregnancy in women with SSc is increasing, since a greater number of women are choosing to have children later in life.</p><p>This topic will review issues of fertility and pregnancy outcome among patients with SSc, as well as the impact of pregnancy upon disease activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is difficult to draw any clear conclusions concerning fertility in women with systemic sclerosis (SSc). In the 1950s, women with SSc were thought to have diminished fertility because of the low incidence of pregnancy in those with preexisting disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, subsequent studies showed mixed results with respect to pregnancy rates and to the frequency of pregnancy difficulties among women with SSc, both prior to and after the diagnosis.</p><p>The following findings were noted in different observational studies of women with SSc who were of childbearing age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nonsignificant threefold increase in risk of the combined end-point of infertility and spontaneous abortion compared with controls in a retrospective analysis of events prior to the diagnosis of SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher incidence of infertility and a longer time to conceive prior to the diagnosis of SSC compared with healthy controls (odds ratio 2.3 and 2.6, respectively), but not compared with women with primary Raynaud phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significantly more live births prior to the onset of SSc and significantly fewer live births after the onset of SSC compared with women in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in fertility among women with SSc compared with patients with rheumatoid arthritis and compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p>The conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are limited by their reliance upon patient recall and by a failure to usually distinguish whether women had difficulty conceiving or did not desire pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SPONTANEOUS ABORTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with the information available concerning systemic sclerosis (SSc) and fertility, somewhat more conclusive data have been published relating to the rate of spontaneous abortion in women who become pregnant prior to an eventual diagnosis of SSc. Multiple studies (but not all) suggest that such women have an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>]. As an example, the rate of spontaneous miscarriage among pregnant women, both prior to and subsequent to a diagnosis of SSc, was assessed in one study of 14 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The rate of spontaneous miscarriage was significantly higher among those who became pregnant prior to disease diagnosis when compared with control individuals (22 versus 14 percent). Pregnant patients with preexisting SSc also had a significantly increased rate of spontaneous abortions. A similar risk (relative risk 2.1) was noted in another report of nearly 270 women with SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast to these findings, a third study found an increased number of elective (but not spontaneous) abortions among patients who became pregnant after disease onset, compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Thus, miscarriage appears to be more common among those who eventually develop SSc, but it remains unclear whether spontaneous abortions occur more frequently among those already diagnosed with the disorder. Data concerning the abortion rate among patients with a preexisting diagnosis of SSc are also clouded by the paucity of information regarding medication use during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Whether a history of a spontaneous abortion may predispose a woman to subsequently develop SSc is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although women with systemic sclerosis (SSc) typically have successful pregnancies, clinicians should be aware that there may be an increased risk of pregnancy complications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, prospectively collected data on 99 women who had 109 births were compared with the general obstetric population (total of 3,939 deliveries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. SSc patients had a significantly increased frequency of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and low-birthweight babies. A multivariable analysis showed that corticosteroid use was associated with preterm deliveries, whereas the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> and the presence of anti-Scl-70 may be protective. However, this study is limited because of the relatively few number of pregnancies in the scleroderma group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study compared outcomes in women with SSc with those in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in control individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A nonsignificant trend toward an increased rate of premature births among patients with SSc, compared with the other two groups, was observed. In addition, there was an increased incidence of infants small for gestational age born to women with SSc, but there was no statistically significant increase in fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. An expanded study by the same group of investigators retrospectively obtained reproductive histories in 214 women with SSc and compared them with 167 women with RA and with 105 neighborhood controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The patients with SSc had more premature births and more infants small for gestational age after disease onset. However, these results are limited because the effects of age and medication use on these results were not analyzed. Immunosuppressive agents used in patients with SSc, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, may cause premature rupture of the membranes, as well as infants small for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There have been several case reports of SSc involving the cervix and perineum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In this setting, vaginal delivery can be difficult, and elective cesarean delivery may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF PREGNANCY UPON DISEASE ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the data are limited, pregnancy does not clearly exacerbate systemic sclerosis (SSc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. While there are case reports of poor pregnancy outcomes in women with SSc, in one large study that included 99 women with SSC who had 109 births, the disease remained stable in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were four cases of disease progression which occurred within one year of delivery. All of these women were anti-Scl-70 positive, and three of them had a disease duration of less than three years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">SSc renal crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal disease is common in patients with SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), including scleroderma renal crisis&quot;</a>). In the pregnant patient, however, it is extremely difficult to distinguish renal dysfunction due to SSc from that resulting from preeclampsia and eclampsia. One review of the literature, for example, found that seven of nine patients initially thought to have preeclampsia actually had renal biopsy findings more consistent with SSc renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Another possible differential in the postpartum period is hemolytic-uremic syndrome; this disorder <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished histologically from SSc kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whether pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of renal crisis among patients with preexisting SSc is unclear. One study of women with SSc found no enhanced incidence of renal crisis in pregnant women when compared with those who did not become pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some investigators, however, believe that renal crisis is more common among those with early diffuse disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>An extremely high morbidity has been observed among those who develop renal crisis during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was beneficial in one case report, but ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy because of the risk to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in pregnancy&quot;</a>). Thus, patients with SSc and active renal disease should be counseled regarding the high morbidity and mortality associated with pregnancy. For patients who develop renal crisis during pregnancy, intensive medical support, including dialysis and fetal monitoring in the intensive care unit, should be utilized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Difficulties in delivery secondary to skin fibrosis and the aggravation of relatively minor symptoms may also occur among pregnant patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). As an example, the increased abdominal pressure in pregnancy may exacerbate dyspepsia due to esophageal dysmotility. Some symptoms, however, may diminish; symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon generally lessen because of the vasodilatation of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25040535\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is difficult to draw clear conclusions concerning fertility in women with systemic sclerosis (SSc), due to the very limited data that are available.
