Pericardial effusion can develop in patients with virtually any condition that affects the pericardium, including acute pericarditis and a variety of systemic disorders. Chylopericardium (pericardial effusion composed of chyle) and cholesterol pericarditis (pericardial inflammation resulting from pericardial effusion with cholesterol crystals and other inflammatory cells) will be reviewed here. Other causes of pericardial effusion and pericarditis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of pericardial disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Chylothorax, with or without chylopericardium, is much more common than isolated chylopericardium.

The thoracic duct carries chyle from the intestinal tract to the blood stream (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57280 \">figure 1</a>). Although wide anatomic variation exists, in most persons the thoracic duct passes in relatively close proximity to the pericardium over its course from the cisterna chyli to the jugular and subclavian veins.

The acute leakage of chyle, as would occur following trauma, can result in rapid pericardial fluid accumulation and increasing intrapericardial pressure resulting in cardiac tamponade, while chronic leakage of chyle is typically associated with significant systemic illness.</p><p>The presence of a pericardial effusion may be suspected from the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest radiograph, and has the following clinical features (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H4462926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients without a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion have no symptoms specific to the effusion, but they may have symptoms related to the underlying cause (eg, chest pain and fever in the setting of pericarditis, etc).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common ECG findings in patients with a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion are sinus tachycardia, low QRS voltage, and electrical alternans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The findings on chest radiograph are variable, depending on the etiology and size of the effusion and underlying comorbidities. Small to moderate effusions may not result in significant findings on the chest radiograph, while larger pericardial effusions typically present with an enlarged cardiac silhouette with clear lung fields. </p><p/><p>Significant leakage of chyle causes serious malnutrition, metabolic derangements, and immunologic incompetence. In addition, cardiac complications can occur including cardiac tamponade and, since chyle appears to be a pericardial irritant, acute pericarditis or constrictive pericarditis may also result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of chylopericardium, which may be suspected in patients with a pericardial effusion and potential trauma or injury to the thoracic duct (see <a href=\"#H1575579296\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above), is confirmed following pericardial fluid analysis. The presence of chylopericardium is suggested by the discovery of a milky, opaque, and opalescent pericardial effusion during pericardial fluid sampling, either with pericardiocentesis or surgical pericardial drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77602\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77602 \">picture 1</a>). The pericardial effusion has a high triglyceride level, with analysis of the fluid typically revealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triglyceride level greater than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Cholesterol/triglyceride</span> ratio of less than 1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative cultures and cytology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocyte predominance on cytologic examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fat globules seen on Sudan 111 staining</p><p/><p>The major cellular component of chyle is the lymphocyte, primarily T lymphocytes.

Patients with symptoms suggesting cardiac tamponade require urgent fluid removal, while those without symptoms of cardiac tamponade are initially treated with dietary modifications and sometimes with off-label use of somatostatin. A low fat diet supplemented with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medium-chain-triglycerides-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medium chain triglycerides</a>, which are absorbed by the portal vein rather than the lymphatics, should be initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Patients with refractory effusions will require surgical therapy to prevent reaccumulation and cardiac tamponade, while those with systemic evidence of malnutrition will frequently require supplemental hyperalimentation. Without treatment, chylopericardium is associated with a high mortality rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1575580302\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac tamponade or large recurrent effusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a symptomatic effusion (acute pericarditis, tamponade, or constrictive pericarditis) or a large uncontrolled effusion (an average daily loss of chyle of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> for five days) usually require more aggressive therapy. Pericardial drainage can initially be accomplished by pericardiocentesis or tube pericardiostomy, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and intravenous hyperalimentation. This approach is effective in approximately 55 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nonoperative therapy is usually unsuccessful when chylopericardium is secondary to congenital lymphangiomatosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical therapy is usually considered if conservative therapy does not reduce pericardial drainage after 7 to 14 days or if the effusion recurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. There is no widely accepted daily drainage volume of chyle that indicates the need for surgical treatment, although significant nutritional loss is one criterion. Surgery typically consists of ligation of the thoracic duct and tributary lymphatics, usually via a thoracic approach, along with either pericardiotomy or pericardiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. A transabdominal surgical approach with successful clipping of the thoracic duct above the diaphragm has been reported, as has a right-sided thoracoscopic approach to the thoracic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/18,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27</a>].</p><p>In patients in whom aggressive therapy is considered inappropriate, a tube can be placed in the pericardium at one end and in the peritoneum at the other to drain the chyle away from the pericardium and into the peritoneal cavity where it can be absorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thoracic duct embolization has been proposed as a simple and effective alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1575580308\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatostatin for post-operative chylopericardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Off-label use of the long-acting somatostatin analog, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, has been successful in the treatment of postoperative chylopericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The mechanism of action is presumed to be a reduction in chyle production and thoracic duct flow rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1575580352\"><span class=\"h2\">Mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis has been confirmed with pericardial fluid sampling (typically associated with drainage of the effusion concurrent with fluid sampling for laboratory analysis), patients who are otherwise asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic can have an initial approach of treatment with dietary modifications without surgical therapy. The milky opalescence may disappear or decrease with fasting or dietary modification, but it returns after resuming fat intake. In asymptomatic patients, the effusion may be controlled by adherence to a diet that is low in fat and high in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medium-chain-triglycerides-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medium chain triglycerides</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In favorable cases, the chylous effusion does not recur after a few weeks of dietary treatment, presumably because the initiating cause has resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOLESTEROL PERICARDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distinction between chylopericardium and cholesterol pericarditis is analogous to that between chylothorax and chyliform pleural effusion (pseudochylothorax). Cholesterol pericarditis is a complication of chronic pericardial effusion or chronic scarring of the pericardium and is exacerbated by cholesterol crystals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Common underlying causes of cholesterol pericarditis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberculous pericarditis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous pericarditis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid pericarditis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Pericarditis'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial trauma, a less common cause (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-injury-syndromes#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac injury syndromes&quot;, section on 'Pericardial trauma'</a>)</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations of cholesterol pericarditis are related to the underlying etiology and are similar to other causes of acute pericarditis. Patients may present with systemic symptoms such as fever, flu-like symptoms, and leukocytosis. The major clinical manifestations of pericardial inflammation include pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and electrocardiographic changes (eg, widespread ST elevation or PR depression). Pericardial thickening may also be seen on imaging studies (eg, echocardiography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging), although this is a nonspecific finding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>As with chylopericardium or any other cause of pericardial effusion, pericardial fluid sampling is required to make the diagnosis. Cholesterol crystals are characteristic of this relatively rare disease. When a pericardial effusion is relatively acute, cholesterol remains in solution. However, when the pericardial effusion is chronic, the normal ability to dissolve cholesterol is impaired and cholesterol crystals are deposited in the pericardium and effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast to chylopericardium, the fluid is usually clear (although it occasionally may be cloudy or turbid) and classically is said to have a glittering &quot;gold paint&quot; appearance, although many other colors have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Blood associated with inflammation is thought to be the source of cholesterol in the pericardial fluid, and evidence of current or previous hemorrhage is usually evident. The pericardium is thicker than normal, and its inner surface is lined with plaques and cholesterol deposits. The histologic findings include fibrosis, inflammatory cells, cholesterol clefts, crystals of variable geometry, and giant cell granulomata.</p><p>The effusions in patients with cholesterol pericarditis tend to be large. The concentration of cholesterol equals or exceeds that of the blood, often attaining values above 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The pericardial effusion associated with myxedema also has a high cholesterol concentration, but crystals are usually absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conservative therapy is rarely effective for cholesterol pericarditis. The optimal therapy is radical pericardiectomy plus treatment of the underlying cause of chronic recurrent pericarditis. Pericardiocentesis is seldom effective over the long-term because the cholesterol effusions tend to recur and can cause tamponade at any time. This procedure also fails to address the thick, scarred pericardium and does not prevent the late development of constrictive pericarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-pericarditis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234278\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chylopericardium is a pericardial effusion comprised of chyle, the normal content of the lacteals (lymphatics of the small intestine) and thoracic duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57280 \">figure 1</a>).
