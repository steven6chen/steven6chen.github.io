Although IPV affects all people, more women than men experience IPV. Lifetime estimates for IPV involving women in the United States range from 22 to 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In countries around the world, 10 to 69 percent of women report physical assault by an intimate partner at some time in their life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;intimate partner violence&quot; describes actual or threatened psychological, physical, or sexual harm by a current or former partner or spouse. IPV can occur among people of all gender identities and sexual preferences and does not require sexual intimacy.</p><p>Care of the person experiencing IPV requires a team approach involving medical, institutional, and community resources. The clinician's role is to make the diagnosis, provide ongoing medical care and emotional support, assess patient safety, counsel the patient about the nature and course of domestic violence, educate the patient about the range of available support services, document findings, make appropriate referrals, and assure follow-up.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinician's role in managing the patient in whom IPV has been identified. The clinical manifestations of IPV and the screening and diagnosis of IPV are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12233035\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Futures without Violence has identified four guiding principles of intervention for clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survivor safety &ndash; Being always aware that the primary concern is to maximize safety and not increase risk for further harm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survivor empowerment &ndash; Facilitating the patient's ability to make their own choices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perpetrator accountability &ndash; Framing the violence as occurring because of the perpetrator's behavior and not the survivor's</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advocacy for social change &ndash; Collaboration and advocacy beyond the healthcare setting</p><p/><p>The World Health Organization issued guidance in 2013 for responding to intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence against women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The guidelines stress the importance of &ldquo;woman-centered&rdquo; care as first-line support, including confidentiality when possible, privacy, nonjudgmental support, validation, and not pressuring the woman to leave the relationship. The guidelines incorporate recommendations for initial support, care for survivors, clinician training, healthcare policy, and mandatory reporting.</p><p>When IPV has been identified, the most important first consideration is to offer support to the patient. It is crucial that providers affirm their understanding of how difficult it must be for the patient to share this information, recognize the patient's strength in doing so, and provide assurance that the provider will be available to the patient for the future. This should be immediately followed by an assessment of the victim's safety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266712060\"><span class=\"h2\">Support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate expression of empathy, acknowledgement, and continued ability to support and assist the patient are the most important components of care after a patient has disclosed abuse. Some suggest explicitly thanking the patient for the trust shown by their willingness to share difficult information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Close follow-up is often warranted, especially if the patient is in crisis.</p><p>Empathy may be shared with the following comments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;I am very sorry this is happening to you.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;I am glad you were able to tell me.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;This is a common problem.&quot;</p><p/><p>Validation may be expressed with the following statements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;You do not deserve this, and it is not your fault.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;You must be very strong to have been able to go through this and now to be able to ask for help.&quot;</p><p/><p>Assistance can be offered by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;I want to help you through this in any way I can.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;I have worked with others with this problem and can assist you in improving your health and with resources to support you through working on this problem.&quot;</p><p/><p>Patients may not be ready to take action at the initial disclosure, but may be helped to move toward action, with understanding of their stage of readiness on a continuum of stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-contemplation &ndash; The patient is not concerned about the situation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contemplation &ndash; The patient has considered change but is not ready to take action.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination &ndash; The patient has decided to make changes in their situation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Action &ndash; The patient is actively seeking help and taking steps to address the IPV.</p><p/><p>The clinician should help the patient along this continuum and assure the patient that they will not be abandoned, regardless of where they are in the process of change. Many patients will not move in a linear fashion through these stages. Clinicians should support the patient in making changes for which they are ready, and not recreate the dynamics of power and control by insisting on progress through the stages to departure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24185048\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing for safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician must assess the safety of all patients who are experiencing IPV. Although the vast majority of patients are not in imminent danger and are not planning to leave their relationship, it should not be overlooked that IPV can result in death. Assessing for safety and making a safety plan can decrease the risk of mortal harm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences#H86601681\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences&quot;, section on 'Homicide'</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should ask the patient how afraid they are and what they think are their immediate and future safety needs. Unfortunately, many people minimize or deny their danger. Clinicians may be surprised or frustrated with the severity of abuse patients are willing to tolerate and should understand that love and other family concerns, such as children in the home and economic factors, often confound the picture.</p><p>In an open-ended way, patients should be asked about their concerns and fears. A <a href=\"http://dangerassessment.org/DA.aspx&amp;token=SnoimVnQs0e1/0QDvDo9PgyYA3Py1SDUCgytwxB3yk3fA/w5/Sdzzv6MnCQPYgX6&amp;TOPIC_ID=15306\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">20-item Danger Assessment tool</a> has been developed and validated to predict the likelihood of lethality or near lethality in an IPV relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a validation study, the sensitivity of the tool for attempted femicide was 38 percent for scores between 14 and 17, and 85 percent for scores 18 to 20.</p><p>Patients should be offered referral to talk to about options and safety. For patients who are not ready or are too fearful to proceed with referral, support and concern should be discussed on subsequent visits, and the patient should again be asked to consider referral to someone to help them think about their options. Providers should become aware of clinic, hospital, local, and community resources to aid in referral.

Depending on availability, a hospital or community domestic violence advocate, hospital social worker, or local domestic violence hotline can provide advice about the recommended plan in the community. The patient may need access to a shelter.</p><p>A safety plan should include the following elements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparing an emergency kit with important documents, keys, money, and other essential items, to be stored outside the home in case they need to escape urgently (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F85533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85533 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A place to go (friends, family, shelter)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A signal to alert children or neighbors to call 911</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During times of escalating conflict, avoiding rooms with potential weapons (kitchen) or risk for increased injury (hard bathroom surfaces)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24185091\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTION, COUNSELING, AND REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providers should assure the abused patient that they are available for support. In addition, the patient should be offered referral for counseling about options and safety, often to an onsite or local domestic violence agency where available. Patients may be reluctant or resistant to talking with anyone else because of fears about safety. On subsequent visits, you may emphasize ongoing support and concern and ask the patient again to consider referral to someone who can help think about options.</p><p>Caution should be taken in providing the patient with written materials since safety may be jeopardized if the batterer finds this material. One institution provides an unidentified phone number for the Family Violence Program as one of many important numbers printed on the back of clinician business cards. If brochures are distributed, it should be made clear that the patient has a place to keep them that would not be accessible to the perpetrator. The <a href=\"http://www.whengeorgiasmiled.org/aspire-news-app/&amp;token=wTpvq7y1CWzfG91hVGqtzTKH87IsfzCgUD0OopKIF20pxrWAp05LIiLNKPMpNaLyNSSofQzCB8ZLs4lY+8TQGQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=15306\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ASPIRE News App</a>, which appears like a news site, offers a discrete way to call for help and can be downloaded onto a phone or other device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>DO NOT confront the perpetrator, as this can endanger patients and, potentially, providers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5052650\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of interventions for domestic violence has been studied and have shown limited benefits for most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some studies show benefits for pregnant women.</p><p>Studies have not shown conclusive benefits for advocacy or counseling interventions. A 2015 systematic review found insufficient evidence to determine if advocacy (providing information, support, and resource access) in healthcare settings is effective for women who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Intensive advocacy may improve short-term quality of life and decrease physical abuse one to two years after the intervention for women living in shelters.</p><p>Interventions may be effective in pregnant women. In a 2012 meta-analysis of four trials, counseling interventions reduced IPV, improved birth outcomes for pregnant women, reduced IPV in the postpartum period, and reduced unsafe relationships and pregnancy coercion for women seen in family planning clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, a subsequent 2014 systematic review looking at nine studies concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of interventions for domestic violence on pregnancy outcomes due to the heterogeneity and poor quality of studies overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The 2013 World Health Organization guidelines concluded that, except for women who have spent at least one night in a shelter or for pregnant women experiencing IPV, there is insufficient evidence that interventions for IPV improve health outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>It is worth noting that quality research studying people exposed to violence is fraught with issues related to ongoing patient safety and coercion, which may <span class=\"nowrap\">limit/bias</span> enrollment, participation, and follow-up. There are no large studies of the effectiveness of interventions in men or LGBTQ persons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24185098\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling the victim</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Counseling may strengthen the victim's sense of self-worth and provide ongoing support, although objective evidence to support these benefits is limited. Counseling can also assess the degree of danger for victims and their children and help them develop a safety plan. Brief advocacy has been shown to increase the use of safety behaviors by abused women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Many victims of abuse are not ready to leave their abusers because of fear of reprisal; economic dependence on the abuser, especially if there are children; no acceptable place to go; belief that the abuse will stop; or belief that the abuse is their fault. Victims may believe expressions of remorse and promises that the abuser will change their behavior. Dropout rates from treatment programs are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Attempting to or leaving a relationship with a perpetrator often increases the risk of injury. Providers should not encourage their patients to leave a relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If patients come to their own decision to terminate a relationship, close attention should be paid to devising and implementing a safety plan and seeking assistance from hospital and community resources where available.</p><p>Clinicians should screen the patient for possible psychologic issues (depression and anxiety) as well as substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Many centers are now routinely screening for depression and assessing for anxiety and substance use in patients at risk. Co-locating behavioral health care within primary care clinics may enable more vulnerable patients to benefit from care with medications and counseling without referral to other providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition to concerns about the patient, clinicians should consider whether child protective services are required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Childhood exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24185105\"><span class=\"h3\">Local resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient appears in danger, referral to in-house <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> community resources is important.

State policies differ on whether the situation in which a child witnesses a parent being abused is considered child abuse. There has been concern that mandated reporting may be a barrier to the parent's being willing to reveal abuse or even be a barrier to clinic attendance by parents.

In general, a community advocate or legal advisor will assist the patient with obtaining this document.

In one US retrospective study, compared with abuse victims who did not obtain a protection order, women who were granted a temporary (usually two-week) restraining order were more likely to be subsequently psychologically abused in the 12 months following the index incident, while women who obtained a permanent protection order (12 months) were less likely to be physically abused in the 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24185155\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGING THE CHALLENGING PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of prior, rather than current abuse, may present with chronic health problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

It is important not to abandon these patients, even if their problems continue to be difficult to solve.

In 2012, the US Department of State and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) announced an official strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence globally, to coordinate efforts between multiple governmental groups, to integrate gender violence prevention in US government work, and to improve data collection and research efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24185169\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The expression of empathy, acknowledgement, and continued ability to support and assist the patient are the most important components of care immediately after a patient has disclosed abuse. Close follow-up is often warranted, especially if the patient is in crisis. (See <a href=\"#H266712060\" class=\"local\">'Support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All intimate partner violence (IPV) patients should be assessed for safety. Many people experiencing IPV minimize or deny their danger. In an open-ended way, patients should be asked about their concerns and fears. Patients should be offered referral to someone to talk to about options and safety. For patients who are not ready or are too fearful to follow through with referral, support and concern should be ongoing and referral options discussed on subsequent visits. (See <a href=\"#H24185048\" class=\"local\">'Assessing for safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If any significant risk factor for escalating abuse is present, it is imperative to devise a safety plan as the patient may be at risk of harm or death. A hospital or community domestic violence advocate, hospital social worker, or local domestic violence hotline can provide advice about the recommended plan in the community. (See <a href=\"#H24185076\" class=\"local\">'Safety plan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Counseling may strengthen the victim's sense of self-worth and provide ongoing support, although objective evidence to support these benefits is limited. Counseling can also assess the degree of danger for victims and their children. The abused patient should be reassured that the provider is available for support. Caution should be taken in providing the patient with written materials, since safety may be jeopardized if the batterer finds this material. DO NOT confront the perpetrator, as this can endanger the patient and, potentially, the provider. (See <a href=\"#H24185091\" class=\"local\">'Intervention, counseling, and referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful documentation is important if the patient seeks legal redress. Reports should specify quotes from the patient about the occurrence, nature, and time of abuse, findings from the physical examination, and photographs if consented. Patients do have the right to ask that information regarding IPV not be included in their chart <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> not be visible on an electronic patient portal or any paperwork provided to them. Often information in the chart can help with incriminating the perpetrator; however, in situations where perpetrators have access to the records (shared children), this information may increase danger to victims. (See <a href=\"#H24185127\" class=\"local\">'Documentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician needs to be familiar with state or country law regarding situations for which reporting is mandated. Requirements for reporting vary by state in the United States. Abuse involving disabled persons, older adults, children under the age of 18, or weapon use commonly require reporting. Protection orders are intended to legally prevent perpetrators from contact with victims, but evidence of their effectiveness is inconsistent.
