Ebola is a very serious infection and often leads to death. It is caused by a virus.</p><p>Ebola has occurred in Central Africa (for example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the Sudan, and West Africa. The biggest outbreak happened in West Africa from 2014 to 2016. This outbreak affected the countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. There were also a few people who got the virus in West Africa, then returned to the United States and Europe. Two nurses in the United States who took care of one of these people also got Ebola, but they got better.</p><p>For the most current information about Ebola outbreaks, and how to protect yourself and others from infection, see one of these websites:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsS2w2f795le/W5BejjZJaFc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=96684\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cdc.gov</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>World Health Organization (WHO): <a href=\"http://www.who.int/&amp;token=CGrU2PnO7/NB7T04m20ugFEw22uw+BLrRc6MKqfuLik=&amp;TOPIC_ID=96684\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69268375\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Ebola?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, the symptoms are like those of the flu, but they can get much worse. The infection can lead to death.</p><p>Symptoms typically start 2 to 21 days after an exposure. At first the symptoms might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden fever, chills, and feeling sick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body and back aches</p><p/><p>A few days after the first symptoms start, other symptoms and signs can develop, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watery diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding or bruising &ndash; This doesn't happen to everyone. If it does happen, bleeding can show up as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tiny purple spots (where blood vessels have burst)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bloody diarrhea or bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oozing blood from the mouth, nose, eyes, or anywhere the skin has been broken</p><p/><p>Even if a person recovers from Ebola, he or she might continue to have problems. These can include joint pain, eye problems, hearing loss, headache, or tiredness. In some people, these problems are severe. They can last months or even years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49502338\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I get Ebola?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can get Ebola in one of these ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have been in direct contact with someone who has Ebola. Direct contact means that you have touched body fluids (such as blood, saliva, mucus, vomit, urine, diarrhea, or semen) from an infected person (alive or dead) and have touched your eyes, nose, or mouth, or an open cut, wound, or scrape. (Sometimes people touch fluids and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth without realizing it.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have direct contact with objects that have the virus on them (such as medical equipment).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an animal that has Ebola. It is also possible to get infected by eating undercooked meat from an infected animal.</p><p/><p>It might also be possible to get Ebola by having sex with a person who had the disease. Even if the person has gotten better, the virus might still be in their body for a while. Experts say the safest thing is to avoid having sex (oral, anal, or vaginal) with anyone who has had Ebola until the doctor says it is safe. If this is not possible, you should <strong>always</strong> use a condom to protect yourself. It is also possible for a mother who survived Ebola to pass it on to her baby through breastfeeding. </p><p>Ebola is <strong>not</strong> spread through the air.</p><p>Ebola virus on dry surfaces, such as doorknobs and countertops, can survive for several hours. When it is in body fluids (such as blood), the virus can survive up to several days at room temperature. Ebola virus is killed with hospital-grade disinfectants or household bleach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69268381\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have been exposed to Ebola, or have been to an area where many people are sick with Ebola, you might be asked to monitor your temperature. If you have had a possible exposure to Ebola virus, public health officials might monitor you as well. For an updated list of places affected by Ebola, see the CDC website mentioned above.</p><p>If you might have been exposed &ndash; even if you did not have direct contact with someone with Ebola &ndash; your doctor or a public health official can tell you what to do. You will probably need to do these things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your temperature every day for 21 days after your last exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check yourself for any of the Ebola symptoms listed above for 21 days after your last exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you think you have a fever, or any symptoms of Ebola, call your doctor, nurse, or your state or country health department.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are very sick, and need to go to the hospital right away, let the ambulance and hospital staff know as soon as possible that you might have Ebola. That way, the healthcare workers taking care of you will know to protect themselves and others from infection.</p><p/><p>If you are seen for a possible Ebola infection, a doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. He or she will also ask where you live, where you have traveled, and what type of contact you have had with people (or animals) that might be sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69268387\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Ebola?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there is a test that can be done on blood or other body fluids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69268393\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Ebola treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have Ebola, you might be treated in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the &quot;ICU&quot;). There is no cure for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can help support your body while it fights the infection, and make you as comfortable as possible. You might need to get fluids through a tube that goes into a vein (called an &quot;IV&quot;). You might also need medicines to help support your blood pressure or treatments to help your blood clot properly. There are experimental treatments that have been given to some patients with Ebola. But these have not yet been proven to work in everyone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69268399\"><span class=\"h1\">Can Ebola be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccines to prevent Ebola are being studied. In the meantime, you can reduce your chances of getting Ebola by staying away from people who have Ebola or who have had contact with Ebola victims. The virus can spread between people who have close contact with one another. The virus travels in body fluids, so any kind of contact with potentially infected body fluids is risky.</p><p>If you must be around people who are sick with Ebola, contact your doctor, nurse, or local health officials to find out how to protect yourself. You will need to wash your hands with soap and water often, and you will need to wear gloves, a mask, a gown, and lots of other protective gear. It's important that you know just how to put the protective gear on and take it off. Your local health officials can teach you. Do not try to do this on your own without help from an expert.</p><p>Do <strong>not</strong> touch anyone who is sick with or died from Ebola. The bodies of people who have died from Ebola must be handled using protective gear. They must be buried or burned as soon as possible after death. You should let specially trained people bury the bodies of those who died (or might have died) from Ebola.</p><p>If you are in areas where Ebola is present, avoid contact with bats, monkeys, and non-human primates (such as chimpanzees or gorillas). Also avoid blood, fluids, or raw meat from these animals. These animals can spread Ebola to people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H375208103\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
