The epidemiology and pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms and the management of unruptured aneurysms are discussed here. The epidemiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of SAH, and issues related to screening for aneurysms are discussed separately.

Of patients with cerebral aneurysms, 20 to 30 percent have multiple aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Aneurysmal SAH occurs at an estimated rate of 6 to 16 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In North America, this translates into approximately 30,000 affected persons per year. Thus, most aneurysms, particularly small aneurysms, do not rupture (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Risk of aneurysm rupture'</a> below).</p><p>Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is believed to account for 0.4 to 0.6 percent of all deaths. Approximately 10 percent of patients die prior to reaching the hospital, and only one-third has a &quot;good result&quot; after treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most intracranial aneurysms (approximately 85 percent) are located in the anterior circulation, predominantly on the circle of Willis. Common sites include the junction of the anterior communicating artery with the anterior cerebral artery, the junction of the posterior communicating artery with the internal carotid artery, and the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery. Posterior circulation sites often include the top of the basilar artery, the junction of the basilar artery and the superior or anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, and the junction of the vertebral artery and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There is a female preponderance for aneurysms ranging from 54 to 61 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. In populations older than 50 years, the increased prevalence in women may approach a 2 to 1 ratio or greater.

A systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed a substantial genetic contribution to the occurrence of intracranial aneurysms that involve multiple pathophysiologic pathways, while noting that large-scale replication studies in a full spectrum of populations are needed with investigation on how specific genetic factors related to aneurysm size, location and risk of rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li><strong>Hereditary syndromes</strong> &mdash; A known hereditary syndrome is often present when aneurysms are diagnosed in more than one family member. Heritable disorders associated with the presence of intracranial aneurysm include:</li></ul></p><p><ul class=\"hyphen-block\"><li>Connective tissue diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and pseudoxanthoma elasticum are associated with intracranial aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], but probably not Marfan syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mechanism by which connective tissue diseases predispose to aneurysm formation presumably involves an inherent weakness of the arterial wall exposed to the non-laminar flow pattern of blood, which is then exposed to shear stresses. Aneurysm formation in glucocorticoid-remediable hyperaldosteronism may result in part from congenital hypertension during the early stages of cerebrovascular development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Concurrent hypertension also may contribute in polycystic kidney disease, although the precise mechanism is unclear.</li><li>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is associated with a 6.9 times higher risk of intracranial aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Autosomal recessive PKD may also be a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>)</li><li>Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (familial aldosteronism type I) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hyperaldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial hyperaldosteronism&quot;</a>)</li><li>Moyamoya syndrome is also associated with an increased frequency of intracranial aneurysms. Although most cases of moyamoya are sporadic, there is probably a genetic susceptibility underlying the disease, and familial occurrence is known to occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moyamoya disease: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</li></ul></p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li><strong>Familial aneurysms</strong> &mdash; Family members of patients with intracranial aneurysms are at increased risk of having an aneurysm, even in the absence of a known hereditary syndrome. In one study, for example, the age-adjusted prevalence of incidental aneurysms in first-degree relatives of patients with an aneurysm was 9 percent, a number significantly higher than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Only a small proportion of these families had an identifiable hereditary syndrome known to be associated with aneurysms. In a second report of patients with mostly sporadic SAH, intracranial aneurysms were found in 4 percent of first-degree relatives (approximately twice that of the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other studies have estimated that a family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage confers a 3.6 times greater risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].<br/><br/>The mode of inheritance is variable, with autosomal dominant, recessive, and multifactorial transmission evident in different families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Familial aneurysms have been linked to multiple chromosomal loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. <br/><br/>Familial aneurysms tend to rupture at a smaller size and younger age than sporadic aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/12,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21,22</a>]. Siblings often experience rupture in the same decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Aneurysms tend to occur at similar locations within families, suggesting that a specific anatomic vulnerability may be inherited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</li></ul></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because intracranial aneurysms are the major etiology of SAH, risk factors for SAH may also be risk factors for intracranial aneurysms. Risk factors for SAH include hypertension, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypercholesterolemia and regular physical exercise appear to decrease the risk of aneurysm formation; there is some speculation that the former effect is mediated through statin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Known and possible risk factors for aneurysm formation include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cigarette smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of cigarette smoking was illustrated in a case-control analysis of 45 men and 70 women with SAH between the ages of 35 and 64 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Cigarette smokers had a significantly increased risk of SAH compared with a control population; the relative risk for men and women was 3.0 and 4.7, respectively, and the risk increased with the number of cigarettes smoked. Those who both smoked and had hypertension had an almost 15-fold increase in risk of SAH compared with normotensive nonsmokers; this additive effect of hypertension and smoking on aneurysm formation has been noticed in other studies as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] In a study of familial intracranial aneurysms, the risk of intracranial aneurysm within affected families was increased by cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which cigarette smoking predisposes to aneurysm formation may involve decreasing the effectiveness of alpha-1 antitrypsin, an important inhibitor of proteases such as elastase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Support for this hypothesis is derived from studies, which suggest that patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are at increased risk of aneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between hypertension and aneurysm formation and rupture has been controversial, although the balance of evidence suggests that hypertension is a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. One report, for example, compared 113 patients with SAH and angiographically verified aneurysms to 63 patients with SAH but no aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Blood pressure greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">160/95</span> was present in 62 percent of patients with aneurysms compared with 37 percent without. In another study in which over 20,000 Medicare patients were followed, there was an increased prevalence of hypertension in patients with aneurysms compared with a control population (43 versus 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a female preponderance for aneurysms ranging from 54 to 61 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The estrogen deficiency of menopause causes a reduction in the collagen content of tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This collagen wasting may contribute to aneurysm development in postmenopausal women, analogous to the situation in patients with connective tissue diseases. In one case-control study, premenopausal women without a history of smoking or hypertension were at reduced risk of SAH compared with age-matched postmenopausal women (odds ratio 0.24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, the use of estrogen replacement therapy was associated with a reduced risk of SAH in postmenopausal women (odds ratio 0.47). This protective effect of estrogen replacement therapy has been seen in other studies as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Coarctation of the aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with coarctation of the aorta are at increased risk for aneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Hemodynamic stress causes excessive wear and tear and breakdown of the internal elastic lamina. Turbulent blood flow produces vibrations that may coincide with the resonant frequency of the vessel wall, resulting in structural fatigue. Patients with hyperdynamic flow patterns as a result of anomalous collateral pathways or other high-flow states are predisposed to accelerated degenerative changes in the vessel wall and subsequent aneurysm development. Hypertension, cigarette smoking, and connective tissue disease probably play a contributory rather than causal role in this process (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Other factors'</a> above). There is some evidence that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis and growth of intracranial aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p>In a study that examined 66 saccular aneurysm samples (42 ruptured and 24 unruptured), four histological types of aneurysm walls were identified that may reflect consecutive stages of degeneration leading to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]:</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>Endothelialized wall with linearly organized smooth muscle cells (Type A); 7 of 17 (41 percent) ruptured.</li><li>Thickened wall with disorganized smooth muscle cells (Type B); 11 of 20 (55 percent) ruptured.</li><li>Hypocellular wall with either intimal hyperplasia or organizing luminal thrombosis (Type C); 9 of 14 (64 percent) ruptured.</li><li>Extremely thin thrombosis-lined hypocellular wall (Type D); all 15 (100 percent) ruptured.</li></ul></p><p>Lack of elastic lamina was a common feature of both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.

Symptoms include headache (which may be severe and comparable to the headache of SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]), visual acuity loss, cranial neuropathies (particularly third nerve palsy), pyramidal tract dysfunction, and facial pain; they are felt to be due to the mass effect of the aneurysm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in adults&quot;</a>.)

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for intracranial aneurysm&quot;</a>.) Because symptomatic unruptured aneurysms are unusual, there are little data on the best diagnostic strategy in the presence of symptoms that could be due to an aneurysm.</p><p>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CT angiography (CTA) appear to be able to detect aneurysms 5 mm or larger; smaller aneurysms (down to 2 mm) are less reliably detected or may be seen in retrospect when compared with cerebral angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. A systematic review of studies of CTA concluded that the sensitivity of CTA ranged from 53 percent for 2 mm aneurysms to 95 percent for 7 mm aneurysms, and that specificity was also higher for larger aneurysms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81565%7ENEURO%2F69728\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81565 graphicRef69728 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As technology improves, the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive imaging is also likely to improve. A 2011 meta-analysis of CTA diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms found that, compared with single-detector CTA, use of multidetector CTA was associated with an overall improved sensitivity and specificity for aneurysm detection (both &gt;97 percent) as well as improved detection of smaller aneurysms &le;4 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Another study examining 307 aneurysm in 246 patients found that three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA with volume rendering at 3.0 Tesla had a sensitivity and specificity of 99 and 97 percent that was irrespective of aneurysm size (range &lt;3 mm to &gt;10 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Pretest probability should affect the interpretations of CTA results: in the presence of SAH, an aneurysm is likely, and a positive CTA finding of any size can generally be trusted, while a negative result should lead to further testing; in the absence of SAH, a CTA finding of a large aneurysm (&gt;7 mm) can be trusted, but findings of small or medium aneurysms have a higher likelihood of being false positives and may require confirmation, if felt to be clinically important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Angiography is a more invasive test that is associated with a higher risk of complications, and it should only be performed if there is a high clinical suspicion for an aneurysm despite negative noninvasive studies. Very small aneurysms (below the practical limit of detection of MRA and CTA) can occasionally present with symptoms such as third nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF ANEURYSM RUPTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two large prospective studies have reported on the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA), which prospectively assessed 1692 patients with 2686 unruptured, untreated aneurysms (6544 patient-years) in the United States, Canada, and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and the Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysms Study (UCAS), a Japanese cohort which followed 6697 aneurysms in 5720 patients (11,660 aneurysm-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

With increasing size over 7 mm, the risk of aneurysmal SAH increases correspondingly. In the ISUIA, for anterior circulation aneurysms 5-year rates of rupture for those 7 to 12mm was 2.6 percent; for those 13 to 24 mm, 14.5 percent; and for those &gt; 25 mm, 40 percent. Another prospective cohort study followed 374 patients with 448 aneurysms that were &lt;5 mm in size; the average annual rupture rate was 0.54 percent overall; 0.34 percent for single aneurysms and 0.95 for multiple aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
