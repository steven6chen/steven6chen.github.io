As a result, it is one of the most important public health problems.</p><p>An overview of the sequelae of mild TBI is presented here. The evaluation and management of acute mild TBI are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156196196\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild TBI occurs with head injury due to contact <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">acceleration/deceleration</span> forces. It is typically defined as mild by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15, measured at approximately 30 minutes after the injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>). Some recommend classifying patients with a GCS score of 13 as having a moderate head injury (GCS score of 9 to 12) because they seem more similar with regard to prognosis and incidence of intracranial abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;concussion&quot; is often used in the medical literature as a synonym for mild TBI, but it probably describes a subset of milder brain injuries. The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology defines concussion as a trauma-induced alteration in mental status that may or may not involve loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Nonetheless, there are a variety of short- and long-term sequelae that have important implications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4093484671\"><span class=\"h2\">Second impact syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;second impact syndrome&quot; is used when diffuse cerebral swelling develops in the setting of a second concussion, which has occurred when the patient is still symptomatic from an earlier concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. This is a rare but potentially fatal complication of mild head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. The cause is hypothesized to be disordered cerebral autoregulation causing cerebrovascular congestion and malignant cerebral edema with increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-19</a>]. Some have suggested a similarity with this phenomenon and the shaken baby syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The second impact syndrome is a rare and somewhat controversial complication; there are few confirmed cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. A 2016 systematic review identified 17 reported cases, all male between the ages of 13 to 23 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is unclear why this is not a more frequently reported occurrence in boxers who seem at very high risk for repeated concussions within a short time span. A 1998 review of the 17 published cases to date revealed that in 12 of these cases, there was insufficient documentation of a second impact <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebral pathology such that the diagnosis of second impact syndrome seemed questionable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. According to a 2013 systematic review, no risk factors for this complication could be identified with any certainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>There is no specific treatment for this condition; management focuses on mitigating increased intracranial pressure.

These include headache, dizziness (including vertigo and nonspecific dizziness), neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairment. These typically develop in the first days after mild TBI and generally resolve within a few weeks to a few months. At least one study suggests that a history of a prior concussion, particularly if recent or multiple, is a risk factor for prolonged symptoms after concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Postconcussion syndrome is discussed in more detail separately.

According to the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria, the onset of the post-traumatic headaches should be within seven days after the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The seven-day onset is arbitrary; some suggest that three months seems a more reasonable latency for onset than does seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Headaches may represent a specific injury to the head or neck, may be nonspecific in character, and may have a symptom pattern indistinguishable from other nontraumatic headache syndromes such as migraine and tension headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of post-traumatic headaches are discussed in detail separately.

Seizures occurring within the first week of injury are acute symptomatic events and are not considered epilepsy. Half of the seizures consistent with post-traumatic epilepsy will occur in the first year; 80 percent will occur within two years. Prophylactic treatment with antiseizure drugs does not prevent post-traumatic epilepsy and is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-traumatic seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4278194063\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-traumatic vertigo and dizziness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of post-traumatic vertigo has not been well characterized in prospective studies. Post-traumatic vertigo and dizziness is a substantial contributor to disability after mild TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. </p><p>Head injury may lead to vertigo by a variety of mechanisms, thus producing different clinical syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. When a patient has profound vertigo, especially when there is accompanying nystagmus, postural instability, hearing symptoms, or evidence of direct vestibular injury, consideration of the specific vestibular pathologies is advised in order to appropriately manage the patient. Central causes include diffuse axonal injury, vestibular migraine, and psychologic factors (anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H739841680\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) occurs after a head injury causes shearing and displacement of otoconia, which then settle into one of the semicircular canals, most often the posterior canal in this setting. </p><p>BPPV produces isolated paroxysms of positionally induced vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. There may be a hiatus of weeks and even months between the injury and the onset of BPPV. Evaluation of patients with BPPV after trauma may identify that more than one semicircular canal is involved, a phenomenon that is more common than in patients with idiopathic BPPV (55 versus 6.5 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p>Some but not all studies suggest that BPPV in this setting may be more difficult to treat than in other settings, require more treatment sessions, and be more prone to recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/44,46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46-49</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and management of BPPV is described in detail separately.

Hemotympanum and sensorineural hearing loss often occur along with vertigo. Facial palsy may also occur if the seventh cranial nerve is injured. The symptoms are maximal at onset and progressively improve in most patients over weeks and months due to compensation within the central nervous system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Labyrinthine concussion may occur from blunt injury to the membranous labyrinth from hitting the otic capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. This may occur with abrupt changes of head motion not necessarily associated with impact. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Labyrinthine concussion produces acute onset of vertigo and postural instability, often with tinnitus and hearing loss. Symptoms are maximal at the time of symptom onset and improve over days to months, usually somewhat quicker than with the more severe injury described above. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perilymphatic fistula occurs when trauma causes rupture of the oval or round window and presents with sudden unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and acute, persistent, gradually diminishing vertigo and imbalance.

Patients present with acute onset of vertigo, which is sustained and often dominates the clinical presentation. Neck pain is common but not invariable. Transient ischemic attacks are relatively infrequent in this setting. While symptoms may develop at the time of injury, it is more common for there to be a delay of a day to a few weeks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical manifestations of lateral medullary infarction and vertebral artery dissection are discussed in detail separately.

Identification of the most likely underlying pathology is based upon salient clinical features, in particular whether the vertigo is episodic versus sustained and whether there are accompanying symptoms or signs.</p><p>While the approach to the evaluation of post-traumatic vertigo is similar to that of patients who have not had head injury, evaluation (and management) may be complicated by the fact that there may be more than one site and mechanism of vestibular injury in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The total number and type of head blows, particularly if the angle of impact or failure to stabilize the head results in rotational head movements, may be important as well, but it is difficult to quantify.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Combat-related TBI</strong> &ndash; Single as well as multiple combat-related blast injuries in military personnel have also been identified as a precursor to CTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/76-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-80</a>]. </p><p/><p>Observational studies are inconclusive but suggest that severity of the TBI event as determined by symptom severity and disability duration appears to increase the risk of CTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/26,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,81</a>]. However, no threshold of injury with regard to number or severity has been established. The fact that concussion relies on self-report is another limitation of these studies. Age and gender have an undetermined role in predicting risk, although at least one subsequent study suggested that older age at the time of TBI increases the risk of subsequent dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/26,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,81</a>]. </p><p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype may be a risk factor for CTE as it is for AD. In one series of 30 boxers, APOE genotype was associated with severity of neurologic deficits among high- but not low-exposure boxers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In a similar study of 53 professional football players, older patients with APOE genotype were more likely to have cognitive impairment than those without the APOE genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, other studies suggest that APOE epsilon 4 is not associated with increased burden of neuropsychologic deficits after TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. It has been suggested that recurrent brain injury, and perhaps single brain injuries as well, may activate pathologic mechanisms similar to those that cause brain degeneration in AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. Some investigations suggest that trauma may incite a chronic neuroinflammatory response, a mechanism that has also been implicated in AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. However, further investigation is required; similarities and associations between these two entities may reflect a coincidence of the two conditions rather than a causal relationship or shared pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2342656245\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuropathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CTE is defined pathologically by extensive tau-immunoreactive degenerative changes that are distinct from other tauopathies (such as AD) in their distribution with preferential involvement of the superficial cortical layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/16,60,79,90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,60,79,90-92</a>]. </p><p>In 2016, a consensus panel convened by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and <span class=\"nowrap\">Stroke/National</span> Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering <span class=\"nowrap\">(NINDS/NIBIB)</span> identified&nbsp;the pathognomonic lesion of CTE as an accumulation of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons and astroglia distributed around small blood vessels at the depths of cortical sulci and in an irregular pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Supportive but nonspecific p-tau-immunoreactive features and other pathologies of CTE were also identified. These criteria were found to have good agreement between a panel of seven neuropathologists and the diagnosis of CTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. </p><p>Pathologic findings appear to be specific for this disorder. In one study, pathologic findings of CTE were found in 32 percent of brains from 66 individuals with a history of repetitive brain injury and in none of the 198 brains from individuals without this history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. A pathologic study in 85 patients found that the severity of pathologic findings could be correlated with the severity of clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>While many consider CTE to be a progressive neurodegenerative disease, the nature of autopsy studies, which are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, precludes that determination on a pathologic basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2433538961\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our understanding of the clinical features of CTE is somewhat limited by the almost exclusive reporting in former professional athletes, thus invoking potential confounding bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In general, the core clinical features as described include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairments &ndash; Including memory and executive function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior abnormalities &ndash; Aggression, paranoia, impulsivity </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood disorders &ndash; Depression, anxiety, suicidality</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2608374933\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced neuroimaging techniques (diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy) have demonstrated associated white matter and other abnormalities in these patients; however, further studies are needed to define the sensitivity and specificity of specific findings and patterns of findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/66,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,97,98</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3054022725\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At present, there is no specific clinical syndrome, neuroimaging feature, or other biomarker that has been shown to reliably identify patients with CTE.</p><p>Similarly, there is no treatment modality that is known to improve long-term outcomes.

This concern was raised when higher-than-expected incidences of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were documented in separate reports of Italian soccer players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>], American football and soccer players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], and Gulf War veterans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. However, subsequent studies have not found a definitive association between TBI and ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/103-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-107</a>].</p><p>In a neuropathologic autopsy study of 12 former athletes with pathologically confirmed CTE, three also had motor neuron disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. These three, along with seven others, were found to have abundant TDP-43-positive inclusions and neurites in the spinal cord as well. In one study, 24 patients with ALS and a history of head injury had similar rates of disease progression and neuropathologic findings compared with patients with ALS and no head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4027573908\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least one cohort study found higher mortality rates in patients with mild TBI 13 to 15 years after mild TBI (eg, 27.9 versus 13.2 per 1000 per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>]. It is uncertain whether lifestyle factors or potential neuropathologic changes account for this observation; however, causes of death were similar among patients and controls. By contrast, other cohort studies have not found late increases in mortality after mild TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>], although one of these found that recent TBI (within the past two years) was associated with a higher mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H740292139\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combined acute and chronic morbidity associated with mild TBI suggests placing a premium on reducing the number of concussions. Individuals, particularly older patients, who have had one head injury are at increased risk of recurrent head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p>Use of sport-specific helmets has been found to reduce head injuries in sports such as baseball, ice hockey, rugby, and alpine skiing and snowboarding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/114-117\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-117</a>]. However, these case-control studies leave open the possibility that the observed effects associated with voluntary use of a helmet are the result of general risk-avoidant behavior rather than the helmet itself. By contrast, helmets have not been found to reduce the rate of head injury in soccer players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Furthermore, in some cases, use of protective equipment may adversely affect playing behavior, encouraging risky behavior, so that the risk of injury actually increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. While American football helmets are widely used, there is no standard for helmet construction to prevent concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>Bicycle and motorcycle helmets reduce the severity of accident-related head injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicycle injuries in children: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The National Football League (NFL) has made changes to rules, emphasizing player safety. As an example, in 2009, the return-to-play-from-concussion guideline was amended and blows to the head of a defenseless receiver were prohibited. During the 2010 NFL season, there was increased discipline (increased enforcement, large fines, and possible suspensions) for helmet-to-helmet contact in violation of players' safety rules and a change where the ball is immediately blown dead if a ball-carrier's helmet comes off during a play.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3195641941\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common; most individuals have an excellent prognosis.
