The eardrum is a thin layer of tissue between the ear canal and middle ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The most common causes of a ruptured eardrum are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear infections &ndash; This can cause fluid to build up and press on the eardrum. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme pressure changes &ndash; This happens during scuba diving if you move up or down in the water too quickly. It is called &quot;barotrauma.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poking the eardrum &ndash; This happens if you poke a Q-tip, bobby pin, or other object into your ear canal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27658930\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a ruptured eardrum?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms. But symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very bad ear pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pain that suddenly gets better</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear, pus-colored, or bloody fluid draining from the ear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A buzzing or ringing sound in the ear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble hearing or hearing loss</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27658945\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a ruptured eardrum by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. He or she will also do tests to check your hearing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27658960\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a ruptured eardrum treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your ruptured eardrum was caused by an infection, you will need to take antibiotics. These might be given as pills or in liquid form (for children). Your doctor might also prescribe antibiotic eardrops to prevent infection of the lining of the ear.</p><p>If your ruptured eardrum has caused an injury to the ear (for example, from a Q-tip), your doctor might prescribe only antibiotic eardrops.</p><p>Most of the time, a ruptured eardrum heals by itself, within hours or days. You should see your doctor about 2 weeks after your first visit so he or she can check if your eardrum has healed. If it has not, you will need to see an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. He or she might do surgery to put a tiny paper patch on your eardrum to help seal the hole.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27658975\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can take an over-the-counter medicine for pain, such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27658990\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a ruptured eardrum be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To reduce your chances of getting a ruptured eardrum, do <strong>not</strong> put Q-tips or other objects into your ear canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27659005\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
