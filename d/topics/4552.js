The diagnosis of SVG stenosis is usually made at the time of coronary arteriography. However, coronary arteriography is indicated only in those patients who are likely to benefit from repeat revascularization. We uncommonly use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or measurement of fractional flow reserve in diseased vein grafts. IVUS is occasionally used to size the vessel. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H246852644\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR REPEAT REVASCULARIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The broad discussion of the indications for revascularization in patients with angina after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is found elsewhere. For patients with saphenous vein graft (SVG) stenosis, revascularization is indicated to improve survival or to improve the quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H703120015\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late recurrent angina pectoris after coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Indications for revascularization'</a>.) </p><p>Impairment of flow in a SVG <strong>early</strong> (up to 30 days) after surgery is usually attributable to technical failure, a relatively small conduit, or extrinsic factors as the explanation. There is a high likelihood that angina will persist or that acute thrombosis will complicate the stenosis. Such patients should undergo immediate coronary arteriography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Causes and rates of graft failure&quot;, section on 'Early occlusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early cardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Early graft occlusion'</a>.) </p><p>Although most patients with recurrent angina due to SVG stenosis <strong>after 30 days</strong> can have marked improvement in symptoms with antianginal medical therapy, catheterization should be performed at the earliest signs of recurrent ischemia in most patients to detect critical graft lesions that can be treated before irreversible loss of graft function. Stenoses in these vessels can progress rapidly to total thrombotic occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-prevention-and-management-of-vein-graft-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A heavy thrombus burden in an SVG markedly increases the difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory result using a catheter technique.</p><p>We suggest repeat revascularization for the following groups of stable patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those for whom revascularization is likely to improve survival. Similar to patients who have not previously undergone CABG, this benefit is likely limited to patients with obstruction of blood flow to the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) territory and demonstrable extensive anterior ischemia on noninvasive testing or significant disease in multiple other vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of significant proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease&quot;, section on 'Indications for revascularization'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The lack of mortality benefit of revascularization in patients without significant proximal LAD obstruction was demonstrated in an observational study of over 4600 patients with prior CABG who had a patent left internal thoracic artery (LITA) bypass graft to the LAD but significant disease in another territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-prevention-and-management-of-vein-graft-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bothersome angina after a trial of medical therapy. Revascularization may be undertaken if there is a reasonable likelihood of procedural success and the patient understands the possibility of recurrent angina. Our threshold for recommending revascularization is somewhat lower in these patients compared to those with native disease, as saphenous vein graft lesions may be at higher risk for acute occlusion with progression. </p><p/><p>We do not perform PCI of chronic totally occluded vein grafts due to a lower success rate and a high rate of complication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">PCI versus repeat CABG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients in whom there is an indication for repeat revascularization undergo PCI with stenting. Repeat CABG is not optimal since many patients who develop graft disease are poor candidates for surgery because they are older, more likely to have comorbid illnesses, and are at risk for increased morbidity compared to their first bypass surgery. Furthermore, reoperation is generally associated with less complete revascularization and control of symptoms when compared to the first procedure. In addition, repeat CABG is associated with an increase in in-hospital mortality compared to PCI (6 to 9 versus &le;0.5 percent overall and 11.2 versus 1.6 percent in diabetics). On the other hand, the requirement for subsequent revascularization is greater with PCI and no difference has been detected in long-term survival with the two approaches. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere.

In terms of major adverse cardiac events, the TriActiv System was not inferior to the other devices but may be associated with a higher rate of bleeding complications.</p><p>A separate issue is the efficacy of distal embolic protection devices in patients with in-stent restenosis in SVGs. The lesion in this setting primarily consists of neointimal proliferation and might be expected to have a lower embolic potential. Observations in 54 consecutive patients who underwent PCI for in-stent restenosis in SVGs without a distal embolic protection device are consistent with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-prevention-and-management-of-vein-graft-stenosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

More data are needed to determine the generalizability of these findings.</p><p>Taken together, the above trials have demonstrated the utility of distal embolic protection devices to minimize the adverse effect of downstream debris and thereby improve outcomes in PCI for SVG stenosis. Although these devices have become the standard of care in many laboratories, they are currently underutilized in SVG interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-prevention-and-management-of-vein-graft-stenosis/abstract/58,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,65</a>].</p><p>Limitations of distal protection devices include passage of the device across a stenotic lesion before distal protection is in place, occlusion of distal filters with debris, failure to prevent the movement of toxic soluble mediators into the distal myocardium, and inability to use the device in distal lesions. These limitations and others have led to the development of a variety of other distal embolic protection devices, proximal occlusion devices, and local plaque trapping devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-prevention-and-management-of-vein-graft-stenosis/abstract/58,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,65,66</a>].
