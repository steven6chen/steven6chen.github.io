Several hundred cases have been reported since it was first described in 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Occasional cases have an inflammatory presentation associated with fever and weight loss, and high-grade histologic features with cellular atypia.</p><p>FDCS is now recognized to be a low-grade sarcoma of mesenchymal dendritic cell origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Earlier classification schemes had erroneously categorized it as a histiocytic or dendritic cell neoplasm of myeloid origin.</p><p>The term histiocytic neoplasm has historically been used to refer to tumors associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage</span> and dendritic cell phenotypes, including entities that are malignant (eg, FDCS, histiocytic sarcomas, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma, Langerhans cell sarcoma, indeterminate cell sarcomas) and benign (eg, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Erdheim-Chester disease). FDCS is distinct because unlike the others, it is not of hematopoietic origin and its management more closely resembles that of other soft tissue sarcomas.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and management of FDCS will be described here. The diagnosis and management of other low-grade sarcomas, histiocytic sarcomas, and nonmalignant histiocytic neoplasms are addressed separately.

Only a few hundred cases have been reported in the medical literature. FDCS constitutes &lt;0.4 percent of soft tissue sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a pooled analysis that included 462 cases of FDCS, the median age was in the fifth decade, although cases have been reported in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Men and women are affected equally, but the inflammatory variant is more common in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3669430640\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no known associations with inherited susceptibility, and most reported cases appear to be sporadic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4203955374\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histiocytic and dendritic cells play a critical role in the immune system, contributing to phagocytosis, and antigen processing and presentation to B and T cells. The broad term histiocytic neoplasm refers to tumors associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage</span> and dendritic cell phenotypes. They include entities that are malignant (histiocytic sarcomas, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma [FDCS], Langerhans cell sarcoma, indeterminate cell sarcomas) and benign (eg, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Erdheim-Chester disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. </p><p>Histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms are generally grouped together based upon the functional properties of their normal counterpart (eg, antigen processing and presentation) rather than the cell of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms arise from a CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor. In contrast, follicular dendritic cells, which are found in primary and secondary lymphoid follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], are mesenchymal in origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]; FDCS have an immunophenotype that is distinct from other malignant histiocytic tumors. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that FDCS are responsive to systemic therapy regimens that are used for soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, FDCS is now recognized to be a low-grade sarcoma of mesenchymal dendritic cell origin.</p><p>The process by which follicular dendritic cells develop neoplastic potential is unclear. Comprehensive genetic analysis has not revealed a universal driver mutation or translocation. Rather, FDCS is associated with widespread chromosomal instability, along with dysregulation of cell cycle progression, nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and immune evasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>The <em>BRAF </em>V600E mutation, which is characteristic of many histiocytic disorders, has been identified in approximately 20 percent of FDCS; there may be a higher incidence of <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutations in the inflammatory variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The inflammatory variant is consistently associated with Epstein-Barr virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but there is no known association with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3669430640\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> below.)</p><p>Mutations in <em>PTEN, TP53</em>, and components of the NF-kB pathway have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. Copy number gains in 9p24 and expression of programmed death ligand-1 and -2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) suggest that escape from immune surveillance might contribute to tumor pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Some cases harbor <em>BRCA2</em> mutations, show <em>MDM2</em> amplification, or express somatostatin receptor 2A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Notably, despite being classified as a sarcoma, nearly all cases of FDCS overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a marker that is typical of epithelial cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,20</a>]; signaling through EGFR initiated by ligands in the microenvironment may be critical to the survival and proliferation of FDCS cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2643841271\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follicular dendritic cell sarcomas (FDCS) generally present as a slowly growing, painless mass. In one large analysis, 31 percent of patients presented with isolated nodal disease, 58 percent had isolated disease outside of a nodal structure, and only 10 percent had both nodal and extranodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other studies estimate that approximately one-third of cases present in extranodal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. The most commonly affected lymph node groups are cervical, mediastinal, axillary, and intra-abdominal sites, while the liver, lung, and spleen were the most commonly affected extranodal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>].

In one series, only 8 percent of the FDCS cases presented with disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss are generally uncommon but may be found in patients with liver or abdominal involvement; such systemic symptoms are especially prominent in the inflammatory variant of FDCS, which usually presents in the spleen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver and has a slight female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/5,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3669430640\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> below.)</p><p>Clonal expansion of follicular dendritic cells is also seen in Castleman's disease, particularly in the hyaline vascular variant; 10 to 20 percent of cases of FDCS can present before, concurrently, or after a diagnosis of Castleman's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. Shared overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been suggested as the common pathophysiologic link [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

High-grade features (eg, atypical spindle cells with indistinct cell borders, large vesicular nuclei, and distinct nucleoli) may be present in the inflammatory variant of FDCS. The mitotic index is characteristically low (0 to 10), and the Ki-67 is lower than 25 percent, although higher grade lesions can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. FDCS often has a robust and sometimes clonal infiltrate of B and T cells, including T lymphocytes that express terminal deoxytransferase (TdT+) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells of FDCS express the dendritic cell markers CD21 (C3b complement receptor) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112973\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112973 \">picture 2</a>), CD23, and CD35 (C3d complement receptor), as well as vimentin, fascin, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, and desmoplakin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/22,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,44-48</a>]. Clusterin, CXCL13, podoplanin, and gamma-synuclein are expressed in 60 to 90 percent of cases of FDCS and may be helpful in distinguishing it from lymphoid and other cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. FDCS may express S100 and CD68, which can lead to confusion with histiocytic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Histologically, it is characterized by extensive coalescent epithelioid granulomas, eosinophilic infiltrates, and atypical spindle cells with indistinct cell borders, large vesicular nuclei, and distinct nucleoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The inflammatory variant expresses FDCSP, CD21, and CD35 (as do the cells of the more common form) but is distinguished by the prominent inflammatory component and positivity for EBV by in situ hybridization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H918217164\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follicular dendric cell sarcoma (FDCS) may be suspected in asymptomatic patients who have painless lymphadenopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> masses in extranodal sites (eg, tonsils, lung, liver, spleen), especially in the setting of Castleman's Disease, pemphigus, or myasthenia gravis. FDCS may also be suspected in individuals with unexplained masses of the liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen in the setting of fever and weight loss. </p><p>The diagnosis of FDCS is based upon pathologic evaluation of involved tissue and demonstration of characteristic immunohistologic markers of dendritic cells (eg, CD21, CD23, CD35, follicular dendric cell-secreted protein [FDCSP], and serglycin). (See <a href=\"#H3669430640\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.) </p><p>Patients with suspected FDCS should undergo evaluation at a center with expertise in evaluating and managing sarcomas <strong>before</strong> biopsy and attempted resection. The biopsy specimen should provide sufficient tissue to permit histologic review and to reserve additional material for genetic testing. A core biopsy will usually be needed to obtain adequate material. Although fine needle aspiration biopsy may suffice to establish the preoperative diagnosis, the risk of a nondiagnostic or nonrepresentative sample must be considered. Expert pathology review is essential due to the rarity of FDCS and the difficulty distinguishing it from other entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Histologically, typical FDCS must be distinguished from other low-grade sarcomas, other histiocytic neoplasms, melanomas, thymomas, and other tumors. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Soft tissue sarcomas</strong> &ndash; Low-grade sarcomas, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and other soft tissue tumors (eg, spindle cell sarcomas, liposarcomas, leiomyomas, desmoid tumors, schwannomas, and peripheral nerve sheath tumors), may resemble FDCS histologically. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">GISTs generally arise within the gastrointestinal tract or associated tissues, 90 percent exhibit expression of CD117 (KIT), and they lack expression of the dendritic cell markers CD21, CD23, and CD35.

Unlike FDCS, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma does not express dendritic cell markers (CD21, CD35), is diffusely positive for S100, and lacks desmosomes on electron microscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">FDCS occurring within the retroperitoneum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the abdominal cavity may closely mimic dedifferentiated liposarcoma, particularly if they are MDM2 positive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> amplified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Histiocytic neoplasms</strong> &ndash; Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease are histiocytic disorders that can involve skin, bone, or other sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">LCH demonstrates heterogeneous collections of Langerhans cells with associated eosinophils, neutrophils, small lymphocytes, and histiocytes that may form multinucleated giant cells. Langerhans cells can be recognized by morphologic criteria (ie, large, oval, mononuclear cells with few cytoplasmic vacuoles, little or no phagocytic material, and moderately abundant, slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm), and their identity must be confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for CD1a, S100, and CD207, or by the presence of Birbeck granules by electron microscopy. Both FDCS and LCH can have variable expression of CD68 and S100.

On immunohistochemistry, the cells typically express CD68, lysozyme, CD4, and CD163, but they do not express specific T and B cell markers, myeloid cell markers (eg, myeloperoxidase, CD33), CD1a, S100 protein, or epithelial markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Both FDCS and melanoma may express S100, but melanomas are also positive for MART-1 and HMB-45.

The histologic presentations of thymomas are protean and may include features that resemble FDCS, including nests or swirls of polygonal, spindle-shaped, and atypical cells. Both FDCS and thymoma can occur in the mediastinum and contain lymphocytes that express terminal deoxytransferase (TdT+). Thymic epithelial cells stain for epithelial markers such as keratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), as well as Leu-7, while thymic lymphocytes stain for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD3, CD1, and CD99 (MIC2). Thymomas are distinguished by the presence of Hassall corpuscles, and they do not express follicular dendritic cell markers (eg, CD21, CD23, CD35).

Areas of active interest for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma include inhibitors of epidermal growth factor (EGFR),<em> </em>BRAF, and MEK, and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1).

Occasional cases manifest an inflammatory pseudotumor-like variant involving the liver and spleen that may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss. (See <a href=\"#H2643841271\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected FDCS should undergo evaluation at a center with expertise in evaluating and managing sarcomas <strong>before</strong> biopsy and attempted resection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of FDCS is based upon characteristic histology (eg, spindle-shaped cells in a whorled pattern) and demonstration of immunohistologic markers of dendritic cells (eg, CD21, CD23, CD35, follicular dendric cell-secreted protein [FDCSP], serglycin). Confirmed cases should be assessed for the presence of <em>BRAF</em> mutations and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Accurate diagnosis requires expert pathology review to exclude other low-grade sarcomas, other histiocytic neoplasms, lymphoma, and other cancers. (See <a href=\"#H3669430640\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4203955374\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H918217164\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to diagnostic biopsy, the pretreatment evaluation for suspected FDCS includes (see <a href=\"#H3112388841\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, and serum chemistries, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, and renal function tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Imaging studies should include an integrated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computerized</span> tomography (CT) scan. CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis are acceptable if <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is not feasible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion for concomitant Castleman's disease; biopsy of multiple lesions may be necessary to exclude this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unicentric-castlemans-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unicentric Castleman's disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multicentric-castlemans-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multicentric Castleman's disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients should be assessed for signs and symptoms suggestive of paraneoplastic pemphigus or myasthenia gravis.

(See <a href=\"#H830794009\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT) following surgical resection is not defined, and we suggest not pursuing this approach for most patients after a gross total resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, there is no consensus on this point, and other experts advocate consolidative RT following resection. (See <a href=\"#H3208047324\" class=\"local\">'Role of adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If feasible, we offer surgical resection for an apparently isolated, potentially resectable local recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H3610835301\" class=\"local\">'Potentially resectable recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced disease includes FDCS that is considered unresectable due to its size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> location, as well as disseminated (ie, metastatic) disease. A subset of patients with locally advanced disease may be converted into surgical candidates following initial (ie, neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. RT can be used for local palliation in patients with advanced disease or as primary treatment of a solitary site of disease for which surgery is not feasible. Patients with oligometastatic (ie, multiple lesions that are limited in number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> location) FDCS may also be candidates for surgical resection. For other cases, the treatment of choice is palliative systemic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H4131416650\" class=\"local\">'Advanced disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For initial management of disseminated disease, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> or an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen, as is commonly used for treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas, over other regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H75106451\" class=\"local\">'Cytotoxic chemotherapy and VEGFR-targeted therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other regimens used for advanced sarcoma, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a> as a single agent or in combination with a mechanistic (previously termed mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, are appropriate for chemotherapy-refractory or intolerant cases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following therapies may be options for selected patients with more widespread recurrences who do not respond to systemic chemotherapy, ideally within the context of a clinical trial (see <a href=\"#H964628058\" class=\"local\">'Investigational approaches'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An EGFR inhibitor may be selected if EGFR is expressed by the tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A BRAF inhibitor, with or without an MEK inhibitor, may be selected if a <em>BRAF</em> mutation is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The role of immunotherapy is not yet defined. In our view, immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) should only be considered in carefully selected patients in the context of a clinical trial. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-dendritic-cell-sarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Monda L, Warnke R, Rosai J.
