One-third to one-half of vulvar complaints stem from this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. It can develop in isolation or may occur as part of dermatitis in other areas of the body. Women with vulvar dermatitis often experience chronic irritation or pruritus, which cause them to persistently rub and scratch the vulva. These activities lead to histologic changes in the dermis, termed lichen simplex chronicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of vulvar dermatitis. Other vulvar dermatoses and vulvar lesions are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis based on morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-sclerosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen sclerosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-genital-ulceration-lipschutz-ulcer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute genital ulceration (Lipsch&uuml;tz ulcer)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOGENOUS VERSUS EXOGENOUS DERMATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar dermatitis has been traditionally divided into two subtypes, endogenous and exogenous. However, these categories are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible for both to exist concomitantly in an individual patient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endogenous vulvar dermatitis (eczema) is the term used to describe atopic dermatitis of the vulva. Atopic dermatitis has a familial predisposition, often begins in childhood, and is characterized by pruritus. Although some experts feel that vulvar involvement is unusual, even when there is severe and widespread atopic dermatitis elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65407%7EDERM%2F55375%7EDERM%2F64525\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65407 graphicRef55375 graphicRef64525 \">picture 1A-C</a>), others believe it is more prevalent than previously acknowledged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In women with atopic dermatitis at nongenital sites, the occurrence of erythema in the labial folds, the perianal region, and in the skin between the buttocks probably represents endogenous vulvar dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exogenous vulvar dermatitis results from external factors and is also called contact dermatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85722%7EOBGYN%2F66955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85722 graphicRef66955 \">picture 2A-B</a>). In allergic contact dermatitis, the trigger (allergen) induces an immune response, while in irritant contact dermatitis, the trigger (irritant) itself directly damages the skin. Although exposure to irritants may have been the initial cause of dermatitis, secondary sensitization to allergens can also occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common agents that cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis of the vulva are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71478 \">table 1</a>). Active and inert constituents of topical medications are a very common etiology of allergic dermatitis of the vulva in women with persistent vulvar symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Sensitivity to latex or proteins in seminal plasma are infrequent etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irritant contact dermatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-seminal-plasma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to seminal plasma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar tissue is more permeable than exposed skin due to differences in structure, occlusion, hydration, and susceptibility to friction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The vulvar skin is particularly vulnerable to irritants. Compared with other body regions, the stratum corneum overlying the vulva appears to function less efficiently as a barrier, thereby permitting increased susceptibility to irritants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As an example, preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride and maleic acid induce a greater response after application to normal vulvar skin than when applied to the skin of the forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The vulvar skin is also sensitive to allergens. New exposure to an allergen is most likely to induce a reaction, although patients may also react to products that they have used for months or years. In contrast to the immediate response to irritants, a delayed hypersensitivity (type IV) reaction takes from 12 to 72 hours to develop, is usually pruritic, and often lasts for several weeks. In acute cases, an exposure occurring up to two weeks prior to the dermatitis can often be identified. In chronic cases, the dermatitis may have been present for months or years; identifying the offending trigger in these patients can be difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In acute vulvar dermatitis, the skin displays mild to severe erythema of varying extent with some scaling in dry areas. Fissures may be present along the labial folds. Excoriations from scratching are common and can be complicated by secondary infection with yeast or bacteria (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, or <em>Escherichia coli</em>). Although crusts and scales are commonly observed with dermatitis elsewhere on the body, these signs are often not present in the moist areas of the vulva.</p><p>In chronic cases, the vulvar mucosa is erythematous and may display papillae, a sign of chronic inflammation. The origin of vulvar papillomatosis is uncertain; the papillae can be normal anatomic variants of the vestibular mucosa or a postinflammatory change (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75027 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Papillomatosis is not a cause of vulvar pain. </p><p>The most common symptom of vulvar dermatitis is pruritus, which can be intense and nocturnal. Other symptoms include burning, stinging, or rawness. Symptoms may be exacerbated by heat, sweat, stress, or menstruation. Self-medication and excessive washing of the vulva by women fearful of a lack of cleanliness often aggravate the dermatitis.</p><p>In response to the epithelial irritation and persistent pruritus, the patient may chronically rub and scratch her skin. Repeated cycles of intense itching and scratching result in the thickening of the vulvar skin and accentuation of the normal skin markings (lichenification), a condition called lichen simplex chronicus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68426%7EOBGYN%2F69453%7EOBGYN%2F59195%7EOBGYN%2F81018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68426 graphicRef69453 graphicRef59195 graphicRef81018 \">picture 4A-D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. </p><p>Labial skin folds appear greatly exaggerated, often edematous, and pubic hair can be broken or sparse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. Other changes include hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis. Due to local moisture, scale is usually absent and the skin surface appears soft and whitened. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology#H27976845\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis based on morphology&quot;, section on 'Lichen simplex chronicus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3261461466\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of vulvar dermatitis is in most cases clinical, based on the clinical presentation, a personal or family history of atopy, or a personal history of vulvar exposure to medications, perfumes, or other chemicals causing persistent irritation. Patch testing may be indicated if allergic contact dermatitis is suspected. A skin biopsy is not routinely performed in women with vulvar dermatitis; however, histopathologic examination may be necessary if the diagnosis is uncertain or there is a suspicion of neoplasia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with vulvar complaints should be questioned regarding a personal or family history of atopy (eg, atopic dermatitis, asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis) or autoimmune diseases. Chronic pruritus should be ascertained. Specific areas to address in the history include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are her major complaints? Pruritus can vary from mild to intolerable, sometimes interfering with sleep or other activities. When the dermatitis involves mucosal areas, burning, rawness, and stinging are more common than pruritus and the symptoms are often exacerbated during menstruation and with coitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are her hygienic practices (eg, daily use of panty liners, feminine products, baby wipes)? Women often erroneously regard their personal practices as safe since they have engaged in them for a long time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does she wear occlusive clothing, such as tight lycra garments, confining undergarments, non-cotton underwear, or thongs? These types of garments trap sweat, promote candidiasis, and chafe the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does she apply any medications (eg, topical antifungals) or other agents (eg, lubricants, spermicides, perfumed or deodorant soaps) to the vulva? Women seldom reveal this information unless asked directly. Patients with vulvar dermatitis have often been treated with multiple antifungal agents without success. A report that these creams never helped their symptoms is significant information, indicating that <em>Candida</em> is probably not the source of the complaints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does she have fecal or urinary incontinence? Both feces and urine are skin irritants. </p><p/><p>The answers to these questions help to differentiate an endogenous process (eg, atopy) from that induced by an exogenous agent. Conscientious analysis of the woman's personal practices is the best way to detect potential irritants and allergens in her environment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71478 \">table 1</a>) as well as habits unhealthy for the vulvar skin. In a study of 530 women attending a specialty clinic for vulvar diseases, over 60 percent of patients described adverse personal hygiene or self-treatment practices when specifically questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination should include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful visual inspection of the vulva &ndash; Assess for signs of inflammation (erythema, edema, excoriations, fissures, scaling), changes in vulvar architecture <span class=\"nowrap\">(loss/distal</span> flattening of labia minora, adhesions of clitoral prepuce to glans, narrowing of introitus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57562\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57562 \">picture 5</a>), and signs of atrophy, which indicate long-standing inflammation or inflammatory vulvar dermatosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal examination &ndash; Assess for signs of inflammation (erythema, edema erosions, lesions) or atrophy; perform evaluation of vaginal discharge, including pH, odor, and saline and potassium hydroxide microscopy to rule out acute vaginitis or desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. Vaginal discharge is usually unremarkable in women with vulvar dermatitis. If <em>Candida</em> is suspected by exam findings, a vaginal culture should be obtained even if microscopy is negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete skin examination &ndash; Examine mouth, nail beds, flexor and extensor surfaces, and scalp for evidence of nongenital dermatitis. Look for scaly scalp plaques or nail pitting that suggest psoriasis. Also look for desquamative gingivitis or buccal Wickham striae suggesting lichen planus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Patch testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patch testing may be helpful to distinguish between atopic and allergic contact dermatitis. Patch testing should be performed by a specialist (ie, dermatologist or allergist with access to the appropriate testing panels). In addition to standard series of allergens, the patient&rsquo;s own topical medications, popular remedies, or other suspected products should also be tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patch-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patch testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Positive patch tests for relevant substances occur in 25 to 60 percent of women with vulvar pruritus; fragrances, medications, and preservatives are most frequently implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/8,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19-24</a>]. In a study including 282 women with vulvar symptoms undergoing patch testing with a European standard series and a gynecologic series, 54 percent reacted to one or more allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nickel was the most commonly found allergen, although the authors felt it was not clinically relevant. In contrast, positive reactions to fragrances, topical antibiotics or anesthetics, and patients&rsquo; own products were almost always relevant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71193\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71193 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids is an important cause of vulvar dermatitis that should not be overlooked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/8,9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>A less common but described cause of genital rash is systemic contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Patients sensitized to a topical allergen can develop contact dermatitis if exposed to that allergen systemically (eg, by ingestion, parenteral administration, or inhalation). Four main groups of allergens are generally responsible: metals (eg, nickel, cobalt, and chromium); medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>, an ethylenediamine-derived antihistamine, or oral medications that contain propylene glycol); plant and herbal products, fragrances, and flavorings (eg, citrus, wine, beer, cinnamon, cola, curry, vanilla, or other flavorings); and preservatives (eg, formaldehyde in aspartame). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common allergens in allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy is not routinely performed in patients with vulvar dermatitis. However, a biopsy may be necessary if the diagnosis cannot be made on clinical grounds or there is suspicion of neoplasia. Histopathologically, vulvar dermatitis is characterized by spongiosis (epidermal edema) and a dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes with occasional eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Chronic lesions may show changes of lichen simplex chronicus, consisting of elongation, widening of the rete ridges and irregular thickening of the Malpighian layer of rete ridges (acanthosis), hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis with a modest mid-dermal inflammatory infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory vulvar dermatoses (eg, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis), infections (eg, human papillomavirus [HPV], herpes simplex, <em>Candida</em>), neoplasia, and vulvar pain syndromes are all sources of vulvar complaints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63761\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63761 \">table 3</a>).

Pruritus, irritation, and discomfort are the predominant symptoms, although women can be totally asymptomatic even in the presence of active disease. Lichen sclerosus is characterized by &quot;parchment-like&quot; or &quot;cigarette paper&quot; skin, although thickened, hyperplastic, or lichenified areas are not uncommon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85726%7EOBGYN%2F78574\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85726 graphicRef78574 \">picture 6A-B</a>). Fissures and telangiectasia are common. Untreated disease leads to loss of the normal architecture of the external genitalia and constriction of the vaginal orifice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57562\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57562 \">picture 5</a>). The diagnosis can be confirmed by histologic examination of biopsy specimens if either clinical doubt exists about the diagnosis or if there is concern about possible neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-dermatitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients with lichen sclerosus may also develop lichen simplex chronicus from chronic scratching, and more than one biopsy may be necessary for the correct diagnosis.

In longstanding disease, loss of the labia minora and narrowing of the introitus may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96570 \">picture 8</a>). A skin biopsy for routine histopathologic examination can confirm the diagnosis. Immunofluorescence studies are useful to differentiate erosive lichen planus from autoimmune blistering diseases (eg, mucous membrane pemphigoid and pemphigus).

Vulvar lesions are painful, glassy erosions, while those in the vagina are erythematous and friable. Synechiae can develop in the vagina, which may become obliterated with severe disease. Patients typically have irritation, pain, rawness, and soreness and may have a serosanguinous discharge from vaginal involvement.
