Five human prion diseases are currently recognized: kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). CJD accounts for more than 90 percent of sporadic prion disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>These human prion diseases share certain common neuropathologic features including neuronal loss, proliferation of glial cells, absence of an inflammatory response, and the presence of small vacuoles within the neuropil, which produces a spongiform appearance.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease will be reviewed here. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Kuru, GSS, and FFI, and the biology of prions and the genetics of prion diseases are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diseases of the central nervous system caused by prions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common of the human prion diseases, although it is still rare. Sporadic (sCJD), familial (fCJD), iatrogenic (iCJD), and variant forms of CJD (vCJD) are all recognized. The vast majority of CJD cases are sporadic (85 to 95 percent), while 5 to 15 percent are due to fCJD; iCJD generally accounts for less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Approximately one case of sporadic CJD occurs per 1,000,000 population per year with a worldwide distribution. The mean age for the onset of disease is between 57 and 62 years, although rare cases in young adults and those over 80 years of age have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Patients with vCJD and iCJD tend to be much younger, which led to an early appreciation that the mode of transmission might be different. fCJD patients have only a slightly younger age of onset compared with sCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is no gender predilection for CJD. In the United States, the incidence of CJD appears to be less in African Americans, American Indians, and Alaska natives compared with the white population, however this observation may have resulted from ascertainment bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The incidence of CJD is increased 30 to 100-fold in certain geographic regions including areas of North Africa, Israel, Italy, and Slovakia, due primarily to clusters of fCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The intensity of national surveillance methods also influences the reported incidence of CJD, as well as other prion diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sporadic CJD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of epidemiologic studies have attempted to identify potential risk factors for sCJD. In one reappraisal of three case-control studies, family history of CJD (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 19.1) or medical history of psychosis (OR 9.9) were the only significant factors associated with disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A second study in Australia found that a history of multiple surgical procedures and residence for more than 10 years on a farm were significant risk factors for sCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This latter report used community rather than hospital-based controls. Neither study documented an increased risk of sCJD with receipt of blood products.</p><p>Small clusters of sCJD cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. A retrospective case-control study of all sCJD cases from 1990 to 1998 in the United Kingdom concluded that sCJD cases lived closer together than might be expected in the absence of a disease-clustering mechanism; the results suggested that some sCJD cases may result from exposure to a common external factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the significance of these possible clusters remains unclear. The results of one statistical analysis have suggested that these apparent clusters may result from higher intensity of surveillance in localized geographic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Variant CJD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variant CJD (vCJD) is discussed separately.

Familial CJD is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;, section on 'Familial CJD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Iatrogenic CJD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iatrogenic CJD is believed to be controlled by current practices; new cases are likely to be those with very long incubation periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351540383\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated surgical procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) has followed administration of cadaveric human pituitary hormones (growth hormone and gonadotrophin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], dural graft transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>], use of dural mater in radiographic embolization procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], corneal transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], liver transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], the use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments or stereotactic depth electrodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and secondary infection with variant CJD through transfusion of infected blood products. Dural graft transplants and use of cadaveric pituitary hormones account for the vast majority of cases of iCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>It is possible that other surgical procedures also play a role in the transmission of CJD. In a case control study, the risk of sporadic CJD was increased among individuals who had ever undergone surgery (OR 2.0; 95% CI:1.3-2.1) with highest rates in the category called &quot;other surgery,&quot; which included skin stitches, <span class=\"nowrap\">nose/throat</span> operations and removal of <span class=\"nowrap\">growths/cysts/moles</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This is consistent with two other case control studies that also found an association between CJD and prior surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/13,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,33,34</a>]. In one of these studies, latency from surgery to clinical disease onset was shorter with surgeries involving the central nervous system or eye and longer for systemic surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In another study, three or more procedures was associated with a higher risk than fewer procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is possible that recall bias plays a role in this apparent association.</p><p>The incubation period for iCJD is unknown and probably depends upon the mode of transmission. One study estimated a mean time of 9 to 10 years based upon mathematical models of the incubation time for iCJD acquired after administration of human growth hormone in a population of 1361 recipients, 55 of whom had developed iCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A similar mean incubation period has been reported for dural graft transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, incubation periods as short as five years and as long as 30 years have been reported in other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/35,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351540377\"><span class=\"h3\">Decontamination procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because prions are resistant to conventional physical decontamination methods, disinfection and sterilization of prion-contaminated medical instruments requires specific procedures. It is important to keep the instruments moist after use (either by immersion in water or a prionicidal detergent), because sterilization does not appear to be as effective on dried tissue. Prior to sterilization the instruments should be decontaminated in an automated dishwasher. Options for sterilization that appear to be effective include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoclave at 134&ordm;C for 18 minutes in a prevacuum sterilizer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoclave at 132&ordm;C for 1 hour in a gravity displacement sterilizer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immerse in 1 N NaOH for 1 hour; remove and rinse in water then transfer to an open pan and autoclave for 1 hour at 121&ordm;C in a gravity displacement sterilizer or at 134*C in a porous or prevacuum sterilizer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immerse in 1 N NaOH for 1 hour; then heat in a gravity displacement sterilizer at 121*C for 30 minutes, then clean and subject to routine sterilization</p><p/><p>If the instrument is not fully accessible to the actions of the steam sterilizant, it should be discarded. It should also be noted that the combination of NaOH and steam sterilization can be harmful to surgical instruments. However, flash sterilization or low temperature methods for sterilization should not be used.</p><p>Proven surgical routes for transmission have now been largely eliminated following changes in procedures used to prepare dural grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and use of recombinant-derived hormones rather than hormones derived from cadaveric pituitary pools. An international CJD surveillance team reported that, in 2000, all incident cases of iatrogenic CJD were due to long incubation periods from infections acquired before 1985 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. An exception may be the use of Lyodura dural grafts; those manufactured before 1987 (before new procedures were instituted) were not recalled internationally, and continued to be used until 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Cases of CJD related to these grafts continue to accrue, in some cases 25 years after surgery. In addition, there are four reported cases of transfusion-associated variant CJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Transfusion-related vCJD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Transfusion-related CJD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available epidemiologic studies suggest that a history of preceding transfusion does not increase the risk of developing sCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. However, human-to-human transmission of prion diseases can occur under special circumstances, and low levels of infectivity have been noted when whole blood, serum, or buffy coat derived from patients with sCJD is inoculated into animals.</p><p>No definite cases of transfusion-associated iCJD are known to have occurred. One study reviewed 436 recipients of 36 blood donors who subsequently developed CJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. After 2096 person years of follow-up, no recipient had developed CJD; 144 recipients survived more than five years after transfusion; 68 of these had received blood donated less than 60 months before the donor developed CJD. There is one report of development of sCJD in a patient 8 to 10 months after albumin infusions during coronary artery bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]; however, this is likely to represent a de novo rather than transfusion-acquired case of sCJD. Transfusion-associated vCJD has been reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Transfusion-related vCJD'</a>.)</p><p>Beginning in November, 1999, leukocyte depletion of all blood components was mandated in the United Kingdom in order to reduce the concentration of transmissible agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Other risk-reduction measures are in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15451900\"><span class=\"h3\">Infections in health care workers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CJD infection in health care workers is extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A 1993 publication reports a CJD infection in a sixth physician (neurosurgeons, pathologists) and 24th health care worker (including laboratory technicians, nurses) to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Several cases have since been reported, but such reports have not been systematically collected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Not all cases were biopsy-proven. In most cases, a link to a prior exposure is difficult to establish given the long incubation period and the dependence on the recall of relatives <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coworkers. Case-control studies have not found a significant association between CJD and health care profession [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].</p><p>Physical contact with CJD patients entails no risk of transmission and special precautions are not required in their care. However, special precautions should be employed in the handling of cerebrospinal fluid as well as biopsy tissue; all materials and instruments used must be decontaminated according to established protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Routine sterilization measures are not adequate for decontamination of CJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible animal origins of sCJD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All available evidence suggests that a single bovine prion strain responsible for BSE has infected humans to cause vCJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Relationship with BSE'</a>.) However, additional bovine prion strains have now been reported to cause spongiform encephalopathy in cattle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. One of these strains is associated with atypical amyloid deposition, a neuropathological feature not found in typical BSE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The PrPSc molecular signature of this amyloidotic form of BSE (called BASE) is similar to that of sCJD subtype MV2. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Molecular subtypes of sCJD'</a> below.)</p><p>The significance of this PrPSc molecular similarity is unclear. One explanation is that some cases of sCJD with the PrPSc MV2 pattern might be the result of exposure to BASE. However, it is important to recognize that glycosylation and migration patterns of PrPSc may not be a reliable indicator of prion protein origin. Until further evidence accumulates, the role, if any, of BASE exposure as a source of sCJD should be considered speculative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On gross examination, most cases show some atrophy. However, some, even those associated with long clinical histories, appear normal in this respect. Atrophic brains usually show ventricular enlargement. The atrophy may include the deep gray structures: the caudate, putamen, and thalamus. In contrast to Alzheimer disease, the hippocampus is spared. The cerebellum may also show atrophy of the folia, usually due to loss of gray matter.</p><p>The main histologic features of prion disease are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80949 \">picture 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spongiform change</strong> - The vacuoles that create the spongiform change in CJD are round and between 20 to 50 microns in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70414 \">picture 2</a>). Electron microscopy has revealed that the vacuolization is an intraneuronal process, and that synaptic loss is another common ultrastructural feature.<br/><br/>Spongiform vacuolation can occur in other diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases associated with severe neuronal loss produce status spongiosus as a common feature in end stages. This is a coarse microvacuolization with astrocytosis. The vacuoles are usually larger and more irregular than those seen in CJD, and they are usually concentrated in the upper layers (I-III) of the cerebral cortex. Microvacuolization in frontotemporal dementias is usually restricted to the upper cortical layers and to the frontal and temporal lobes. Transcortical vacuolization in dementia with Lewy bodies is usually restricted to the medial temporal lobe. Acute hypoxic ischemic and other metabolic encephalopathies can also give this microscopic appearance. Finally, inadequate tissue fixation or poor processing can cause artifactual changes that resemble prion vacuoles. The clinical history along with prion protein immunohistochemistry generally clearly distinguishes among these entities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuronal loss</strong> (particularly of cortical layers III-V) without inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Accumulation of the abnormal prion protein</strong> - Accumulation of the prion protein is detected by immunohistochemical techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50744\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50744 \">picture 3</a>). The prion protein can be distributed in several patterns, such as a perivacuolar distribution, a diffuse synaptic distribution, or in plaques.<br/><br/>The plaque type can be associated with specific prion protein diseases, such as kuru, Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome, or vCJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diseases of the central nervous system caused by prions&quot;, section on 'Neuropathology'</a>.)<br/><br/>The pattern and distribution of prion protein deposition may be specific to the subtype of sCJD. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Molecular subtypes of sCJD'</a> below.) As examples, MM1 and MV1 subtypes have been associated with the synaptic pattern of PrP immunostaining, MV2 and VV2 with plaque formation, especially prominent in the deep gray structures and cerebellum, and MM2 with perivacuolar and loose plaque-like formations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Mood changes such as apathy and depression are common; euphoria, emotional lability, and anxiety occur less frequently. Sleep disturbances, particularly hypersomnia, but also insomnia, are also common, and may be a presenting sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].

In particular, iatrogenic CJD related to human gonadotrophin and growth hormone treatment as well as to dura mater grafts has a propensity to manifest as a largely isolated cerebellar syndrome early in the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/22,67,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,67,72</a>].</p><p>Signs of corticospinal tract involvement develop in 40 to 80 percent of patients, including such findings as hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses (Babinski sign), and spasticity.</p><p>Younger patients with sCJD have clinical features that are somewhat distinct from the more typical older patient. In one case series of 52 patients younger than 50 years, psychiatric symptoms were more prominent and the clinical course more prolonged than in older patients, features that may suggest variant CJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a>.) However, test results, CSF protein markers, and neuroimaging, are consistent with sCJD.</p><p>Some clinical findings, although compatible with CJD, should raise the suspicion of an alternative diagnosis, especially if they are among the more prominent features of the illness. These include cranial nerve abnormalities, sensory abnormalities, and involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Disturbances of pupillary responses, extraocular movements, trigeminal neuropathy, and vestibulocochlear dysfunction have all been reported in isolated cases but are not characteristic. Sensory signs and symptoms are common in vCJD but are otherwise extremely atypical in human prion diseases.</p><p>A number of variants or subtypes of disease have been defined based upon focal neurologic findings reflecting predominant involvement of individual brain regions. Examples of these include forms with mainly visual (Heidenhain variant), cerebellar (Oppenheimer-Brownell variant), thalamic, and striatal features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. Variants of sCJD have also been classified based according to the genotype of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and the molecular properties of the pathological prion protein (PrPSc) as discussed in the following section. In addition, patients with iatrogenic CJD from infected dura mater grafts have been noted to have a high frequency of clinical manifestations that relate to the anatomic placement of the graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular subtypes of sCJD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical phenotypes of sporadic CJD have been associated with molecular subtypes determined by the PRNP gene codon 129 genotype and the pathologic prion protein (PrPSc) type. The PRNP genotype is homozygous or heterozygous for methionine (M) or valine (V) at codon 129. The PrPSc type is determined by Western blot analysis and classified in the <span class=\"nowrap\">Parchi/Gambetti</span> nomenclature as type 1 or type 2 depending on the size and electrophoretic mobility of the protease resistant core fragment (PrPres) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>Using this molecular classification, six clinical phenotypes of sCJD have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. The frequency and duration of illness are based on a series of 300 cases in North America and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>] and an additional 2451 patients were analyzed for diagnostic test characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MM1 and MV1 (myoclonic, Heidenhain variant) account for about 70 percent of cases and correlate with the &quot;classic CJD&quot; phenotype of advanced age at onset, a rapidly progressive dementia with early and prominent myoclonus, and a short duration of illness (mean 3.9 months). The MM1 phenotype is the one most commonly associated with periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC) on electroencephalogram (EEG).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VV2 (ataxic variant) accounts for 15 percent or less of sCJD and presents with ataxia at onset, often as an isolated feature, late dementia, and a longer duration of illness (mean 7 to 9 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MV2 (Kuru plaque variant) accounts for 9 percent and presents with ataxia, progressive dementia with prominent psychiatric features, and longer duration (mean 17.1 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The 14-3-3 protein in the CSF is a relatively insensitive marker for the MV2 variant (about 70 percent), and PSWC are only infrequently seen on EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/80,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,82-84</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MM2 can present as either a thalamic variant or a cortical variant. Some, but not all, patients have a young age at onset, and the disease course is typically long, with a median disease duration of 14 months in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The 14-3-3 protein has been reported to be present in 61 to 91 percent of patients with MM2, and periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) on EEG are more often absent than in other MM and MV subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/78,80,83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,80,83-85</a>]. The clinical features of MM2 type sCJD may resemble those of variant CJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)<br/><br/>The thalamic MM2 variant accounts for 2 percent of cases, and mean disease duration is 15.6 months. Insomnia, psychomotor hyperactivity, ataxia, and cognitive impairment are the predominate manifestations, and this phenotype resembles that of fatal familial insomnia (FFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

All patients had elevated CSF levels of the 14-3-3 protein, but none had PSWCs on EEG, and cortical rather than basal ganglia abnormalities were more common on MRI.</p><p/><p>The classification for PrPSc is complicated by the existence of at least two nomenclatures, although the Parchi and Gambetti nomenclature for PrPSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>] described above may be the most widely used. The alternate Collinge nomenclature distinguishes four rather than two PrPSc subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>]. The Collinge PrPSc types 1 and 2 are thought to correspond with Parchi and Gambetti PrPSc type 1, and Collinge types 3 and 4 with Parchi and Gambetti type 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>These molecular subtypes have also been associated with distinctive patterns of cerebral gene expression in CJD involving upregulation of genes involved in immune and stress responses and in cell death and downregulation of genes involved in synaptic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Another study found that more than one molecular subtype may be present in 20 percent of individuals with sCJD and that PrPSc type might be influenced by both genetic and brain region-specific factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>The ongoing identification of rare molecular subtypes of CJD that are not included in these classification schemes may require their subsequent modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. As an example, it has been increasingly recognized that some patients with CJD have both type 1 and type 2 PrPSc, and that patients who have both types have a distinct clinical and pathologic phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In a series of 34 patients with the MM genotype, 20 individuals had both types (MM1+2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. These patients had histopathologic features that were intermediate between patients with the MM1 and MM2 subtypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) must be distinguished from other dementias. Occasionally Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia is associated with myoclonus and a more rapidly progressive course than is typical and is therefore mistaken for CJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].

A 2012 systematic review sponsored by the American Academy of Neurology reported an overall sensitivity of 92 percent and a specificity of 80 percent in diagnosing sCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. A negative test does not exclude the diagnosis, especially in cases of possible fCJD or nonclassical sCJD, and a positive result can occur in nonprion diseases.

This center helps to monitor and diagnose cases of CJD, as well as act as a reporting center to the CDC. </p><p>False positive elevations in CSF 14-3-3 have been noted in patients with a variety of neurologic diseases including herpes simplex encephalitis, hypoxic encephalopathy, cerebral metastases, paraneoplastic disease, and metabolic encephalopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/84,155,160,161\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,155,160,161</a>]. False-positive results are less likely in neurodegenerative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Another report examined expression of this protein in cell cultures of neural and nonneural tissues and found the protein in all cell types, suggesting that the protein may be a marker of brain cell death rather than CJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. Seven distinct isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein, with two phosphorylated subtypes, have been found in neurons. It has been suggested that CSF assays for one or more of the specific isoforms may have improved specificity for distinguishing sCJD from other dementias compared with the standard commercial 14-3-3 assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/162,163\" class=\"abstract_t\">162,163</a>]. However, elevated CSF levels of most 14-3-3 isoforms are described in a variety of other conditions including Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, metabolic and viral encephalopathies, and paraneoplastic syndromes, indicating that none of these is clearly diagnostic of prion disease.</p><p>The test characteristics of 14-3-3 protein test may be influenced by several additional factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one preliminary report, based on the NIH experience, the sensitivity was significantly lower (62 percent) in patients with fCJD.

Studies in patients with sCJD have found that the sensitivity of CSF 14-3-3 protein was high in the classical subtypes MMI and MV1 (91 to 100 percent) and relatively low in most of the nonclassical subtypes, especially MM2 and MV2 (57 to 68 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/80,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,82-84</a>]. These results suggest that the CSF 14-3-3 protein test may be helpful for diagnosis of the classical subtypes of sCJD but may be falsely negative for the nonclassical subtypes. Small numbers of patients for most of the nonclassical subtypes in this study limit the strength of these findings. In one study, a second lumbar puncture (LP) at later stages of the disease improved the sensitivity of this test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one analysis of 1032 assays for the 14-3-3 protein, a positive result was significantly less likely when obtained more than 12 months after disease onset, compared with earlier in the disease (72 versus 92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of other CSF diagnostic tests have been reported in small series, including the S100 protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], neuron specific enolase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>], thymosin &beta;4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>], and tau protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/abstract/163,166-168\" class=\"abstract_t\">163,166-168</a>].

One of these, real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), is an assay in which disease-associated prion protein (PrP) initiates a rapid conformational transition in recombinant PrP (recPrP), resulting in the formation of amyloid that can be monitored in real time.

Approximately one case of sporadic CJD occurs per 1,000,000 population per year. The mean age of onset is between 57 and 62 years. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic CJD has followed administration of cadaveric human pituitary hormones, dural graft transplants, use of dural mater in radiographic embolization procedures, corneal transplants, liver transplants, and the use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments or stereotactic depth electrodes.-Such transmissions are rare now that several of these vectors have been removed from the health care system. No definite cases of transfusion-associated CJD are known to have occurred; although transfusion-related variant CJD has been described. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Iatrogenic CJD'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Transfusion-related vCJD'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main histologic features of prion disease are spongiform change, neuronal loss (particularly of cortical layers III-V) without inflammation, and accumulation of the abnormal prion protein. Accumulation of the prion protein is detected by immunohistochemical techniques. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly progressive mental deterioration, often with behavioral abnormalities, and myoclonus are the two cardinal clinical manifestations of sCJD. Extrapyramidal signs such as hypokinesia and cerebellar manifestations are also common. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical phenotypes of sporadic CJD have been associated with molecular subtypes determined by the PRNP gene codon 129 genotype and the pathologic prion protein (PrPSc) type. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Molecular subtypes of sCJD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CJD is distinguished from more common causes of dementia by its rapidly progressive course with prominent myoclonus and gait disturbance. Other autoimmune, infectious, malignant, and toxic-metabolic etiologies should be considered in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While brain biopsy is the gold standard test for diagnosis, it is often unnecessary. A typical clinical presentation with corroborating findings on magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and cerebrospinal fluid are in most cases sufficient to exclude other causes and establish CJD as the probable diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MRI should be performed according to a suggested protocol and typically shows abnormal signal in the putamen and head of the caudate. Sensitivity and specificity for typical MRI findings range between 83 to 92 percent and 87 to 95 percent respectively. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'MR imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A finding of periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG has a high specificity for the diagnosis of CJD, but a low sensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The 14-3-3 protein test in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a specific test finding for CJD, but its sensitivity can be low, particularly in some molecular subtypes. Additional tests now performed routinely on CSF samples that are sent to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (eg, tau, real-time quaking-induced conversion) appear to improve the test performance of CSF analysis in the diagnosis of CJD. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Protein markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no effective treatment for CJD which is uniformly fatal.
