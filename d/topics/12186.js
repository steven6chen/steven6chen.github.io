It must be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis (sometimes called periorbital cellulitis), which is an infection of the anterior portion of the eyelid. Neither infection involves the globe itself.</p><p>Although preseptal and orbital cellulitis may be confused with one another because both can cause ocular pain and eyelid swelling and erythema, they have very different clinical implications. Preseptal cellulitis is generally a mild condition that rarely leads to serious complications, whereas orbital cellulitis may cause loss of vision and even loss of life. Orbital cellulitis can usually be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis by its clinical features (ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, and proptosis) and by imaging studies; in cases in which the distinction is not clear, clinicians should treat patients as though they have orbital cellulitis. Both conditions are more common in children than in adults, and preseptal cellulitis is much more common than orbital cellulitis. </p><p>The pathogenesis, microbiology, clinical manifestations, complications, diagnosis, and treatment of orbital cellulitis will be reviewed here. Preseptal cellulitis is discussed separately. Orbital infections caused by fungi, mainly the <em>Mucorales</em> (which cause mucormycosis) and <em>Aspergillus</em> spp, and, much more rarely, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>are also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preseptal-cellulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preseptal cellulitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucormycosis-zygomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-and-the-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis and the eye&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis involve different anatomic sites, with preseptal cellulitis referring to infections of the soft tissues anterior to the orbital septum, and orbital cellulitis referring to infections posterior to it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68971 \">figure 1</a>). Orbital cellulitis involves the muscle and fat located within the orbit. Orbital cellulitis does not involve the globe. (See <a href=\"#H459379838\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preseptal-cellulitis#H83430261\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preseptal cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>There is some debate regarding the appropriate terminology for these infections. Some clinicians use the term &quot;periorbital cellulitis&quot; rather than &quot;preseptal cellulitis&quot; or use the terms interchangeably. We prefer the term &quot;preseptal cellulitis&quot; to make a clear distinction between this infection and the more serious infection, &quot;orbital cellulitis.&quot; Orbital cellulitis is sometimes referred to as &quot;postseptal cellulitis&quot;; we favor the term &quot;orbital cellulitis,&quot; and will use it throughout this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459379838\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basic familiarity with the anatomy of the eye is fundamental to understanding the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and complications of orbital cellulitis. The orbit is a cone-shaped structure, lying horizontally, with its apex in the skull. It is surrounded by paranasal sinuses, namely, the frontal (lying superior), ethmoid (medial) and maxillary (inferior) sinuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71411 \">figure 2</a>). The orbit is lined by periosteum. The ethmoid sinuses are separated from the orbit by a paper-thin layer called the lamina papyracea, which contains many perforations for nerves and blood vessels as well as some natural fenestrations termed Zuckerkandl's dehiscences. The most common route of infection of the orbit is by extension from the ethmoid sinuses, presumably through these perforations.</p><p>The orbital septum is a membranous sheet that extends from the periosteum of the orbit to the tarsal plate and forms the anterior boundary of the orbital compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68971 \">figure 1</a>). The superior and inferior orbital veins drain blood directly into the cavernous sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61214 \">figure 3</a>). Because of this communication and because the inferior orbital veins are valveless, infection can pass readily from the orbit to intracranial structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459379483\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orbital cellulitis is much more common in young children than in older children or adults. Orbital cellulitis is an uncommon complication of bacterial rhinosinusitis, but rhinosinusitis is the source of most cases of orbital cellulitis; coexisting rhinosinusitis is present in 86 to 98 percent of cases of orbital cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Ethmoid sinusitis and pansinusitis are the forms of rhinosinusitis most likely to lead to orbital cellulitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) </p><p>As has been noted above, the ethmoid sinuses are separated from the orbit by the lamina papyracea, a thin structure with many fenestrations. Computed tomography (CT) scanning often shows the predominant site of inflammation to be the medial aspect of the orbit, adjacent to the ethmoid sinuses, and subperiosteal abscesses most often occur in the same location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71411 \">figure 2</a>).

Cultures from the orbit are only obtained if surgical intervention is needed, usually to drain an abscess. Sinus cultures obtained during surgery can be used to guide antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but may not accurately reflect the pathogen(s) in the orbit. Blood cultures are sometimes positive in children, the percentages ranging from 0 to 33 percent in various retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. They are rarely positive in adults. In one series of patients with orbital cellulitis, blood cultures were positive in 33 percent of children younger than four years of age but in only 5 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147596960\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly identified pathogens in orbital cellulitis are <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and streptococci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77104 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/2-4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,24</a>]. In one series of 94 children admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital with orbital cellulitis between 2004 and 2009, members of the <em>Streptococcus anginosus</em> (milleri) group were the most commonly identified pathogens (15 percent) followed by <em>S. aureus</em> (9 percent), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (<em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, 6 percent), and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Only one patient had methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) infection but one would expect an increasing proportion of MRSA infections given the rising prevalence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) among strains of <em>S. aureus</em>. Cases of neonatal and infantile orbital cellulitis caused by CA-MRSA have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Uncommon causes of orbital cellulitis include nonspore-forming anaerobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>], <em>Aeromonas hydrophila</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and <em>Eikenella corrodens</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>type b, formerly an important cause of orbital cellulitis in children, has become more rare with the widespread use of the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/24,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30,31</a>], but is still found in over 20 percent of culture-positive abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Some cases of orbital cellulitis are polymicrobial, often with a combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. As an example, in a study of 20 children with orbital cellulitis who had positive cultures from specimens obtained during surgery (from an orbital or subperiosteal abscess <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a paranasal sinus), seven (35 percent) had more than one organism isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Mucormycosis and invasive aspergillosis should be considered in patients with defects in host defenses. Mucormycosis primarily affects patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and sometimes in patients with renal acidosis. <em>Aspergillus</em> infection of the orbit occurs in patients with severe neutropenia or other immune deficiencies, including HIV infection. These infections are discussed briefly below and more fully elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H19539607\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucormycosis-zygomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal rhinosinusitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Fungal causes of orbital cellulitis have been reported rarely in apparently immunocompetent infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Rarely, fungal pathogens other than the <em>Mucorales</em> or <em>Aspergillus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] or mycobacteria (especially <em>M. tuberculosis</em>) cause orbital infections.

Both orbital cellulitis and preseptal cellulitis cause ocular pain and eyelid swelling with erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57604\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57604 \">picture 1</a>); in some cases of orbital cellulitis, eyelid erythema is absent. Only orbital cellulitis causes swelling and inflammation of the extraocular muscles and fatty tissues within the orbit, leading to pain with eye movements, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia with diplopia. Chemosis (conjunctival swelling) may occasionally occur in severe cases of preseptal cellulitis, but is more common with orbital cellulitis. In both conditions, but especially in orbital cellulitis, there may be fever and peripheral leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/2,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,38</a>]. In a retrospective study that included 262 children, fever occurred more commonly in those with orbital cellulitis than in those with preseptal cellulitis (94 versus 47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Rarely in orbital cellulitis, there may be visual impairment, and even blindness, arising from inflammation or ischemia of the optic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The frequencies with which the signs and symptoms of orbital and preseptal cellulitis have been reported in different studies are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62818 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459379581\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is much less common than preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis is a far more consequential infection because it can be sight- or even life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40</a>]. It can be complicated by subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess, vision loss, cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brain abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/18,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,37</a>]. The most common complications of orbital cellulitis are subperiosteal abscess and orbital abscess. These complications may develop rapidly; therefore, close monitoring is indicated, with daily checks of visual acuity and assessment of the pupillary light reflex. A sluggish or absent pupillary light reflex or a relative afferent pupillary defect indicates optic nerve involvement. Any worsening of the patient's symptoms or signs should lead to a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits and sinuses (or repeat CT if one was done earlier) to detect an abscess. (See <a href=\"#H459379685\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Orbital cellulitis results in loss of vision in 3 to 11 percent of patients and in death in 1 to 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Rare complications include cavernous sinus thrombosis and central retinal artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

It is difficult to distinguish subperiosteal abscess from simple orbital cellulitis on clinical grounds, although displacement of the globe is suggestive of abscess. Orbital imaging is necessary to make the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61952\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61952 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>In some patients, a subperiosteal abscess, arising by extension from a sinus infection, precedes orbital cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] or occurs without orbital cellulitis. The abscess can present with minimal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] until it ruptures into the orbit. </p><p>Subperiosteal abscesses in younger children tend to lie medially in the orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], to be amenable to antibiotic treatment without surgery (when small or in the form of poorly organized phlegmons) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/18,33,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,33,46</a>], and to contain a single aerobic species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Nonmedial abscesses in older children, and abscesses located superiorly (near the frontal sinus) appear to be at highest risk for intracranial abscess. Abscesses in older patients usually contain mixtures of aerobic and anaerobic microbes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/34,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,47</a>] and are more likely to require drainage than those in children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459379613\"><span class=\"h2\">Orbital abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess is difficult to distinguish from uncomplicated orbital cellulitis.

Proptosis, pain with external ocular movement, and ophthalmoplegia were associated with the presence of an orbital abscess, although 51 percent of patients with abscess did not have these findings. On multivariate analysis, other factors associated with orbital abscess were a peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;10,000 per microL, absence of conjunctivitis, periorbital edema, age &gt;3 years, and previous antibiotic therapy.

sinus thrombosis should be suspected if signs of orbital inflammation (redness and swelling of the eyelids, ophthalmoplegia, decreased visual acuity) also occur in the contralateral eye. The second eye may become involved a day or two after the first eye. The cranial nerves III, IV, V<sup>1</sup>, V<sup>2</sup>, and VI pass through the cavernous sinus and account for many of the manifestations. In addition, there may be decreased visual acuity due to edema of the optic disc and there may be numbness over the upper face due to involvement of V<sup>1 </sup>and<sup> </sup>V<sup>2</sup>. These patients often have sphenoid and posterior ethmoid sinusitis. This topic is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic dural sinus thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucormycosis and aspergillosis arise by spread from the upper airway, especially the posterior ethmoid or sphenoid sinuses. Accordingly, they sometimes present as the &quot;orbital apex syndrome&quot; with ophthalmoplegia and progressive visual loss, but otherwise minimal signs of inflammation (eg, mild eyelid swelling, little or no fever). They may begin in indolent fashion, but may progress quickly to involve critical structures in the eye, nose, and brain.

During the initial evaluation, it is critical to distinguish preseptal cellulitis from the more serious orbital cellulitis. It is also important to look for complications of orbital cellulitis, such as subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess, visual loss, and intracranial extension. Although both preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis typically cause eyelid swelling with or without erythema, the presence of ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proptosis occur only with orbital cellulitis. Another finding that is more common with orbital cellulitis, and rare or absent with preseptal cellulitis, is chemosis. Fever is more common with orbital cellulitis than with preseptal cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. </p><p>It is important for an ophthalmologist to evaluate patients with suspected orbital cellulitis in order to evaluate the extraocular movements and visual acuity, and to assess for proptosis. In patients with extensive rhinosinusitis, an otolaryngologist should generally be consulted as well. (See <a href=\"#H6817810\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459379685\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of imaging studies are to support the diagnosis of orbital cellulitis and to search for an abscess or other complications requiring surgical drainage. (See <a href=\"#H6817810\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194021484\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful for the diagnosis of orbital cellulitis and its complications. There are no controlled trials comparing these modalities and the choice is usually based on the availability of the test and on the clinical experience of the physicians involved. CT scanning of the orbits and sinuses is used most commonly to evaluate for possible orbital cellulitis and its complications. MRI is superior to CT scan in following the progression of soft tissue disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], but may not be readily available and may require sedation in young children.</p><p>When cavernous sinus thrombosis is suspected, an imaging study that includes venography should be performed, such as magnetic resonance (MR) venography or CT venography. These modalities are discussed in detail separately. MR venography is used most commonly, and would show nonfilling of the cavernous sinus in patients with cavernous sinus thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194021491\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In preseptal cellulitis, inflammation is confined to the eyelids. In orbital cellulitis, inflammation of extraocular muscles, fat stranding, and anterior displacement of the globe are common findings. It is important to note that some cases of orbital cellulitis will have subtle abnormalities by CT scan. There is almost always evidence of rhinosinusitis, most commonly ethmoid sinusitis, and the most intense inflammatory response in the orbit is often seen adjacent to the ethmoid sinus. </p><p>Subperiosteal abscesses and orbital abscesses appear as low-density collections on CT scan. Subperiosteal abscesses lie between the periosteum and the wall of the bony sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61952\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61952 \">image 1</a>). Both types of abscesses, but especially subperiosteal abscesses, are often found adjacent to the ethmoid sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71411 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194021498\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether every patient with suspected orbital cellulitis should have a CT scan is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/19,26,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26,62,63</a>]. Clinicians may be reluctant to obtain a CT scan due to concern about exposure of the pediatric patient to radiation. Guidelines for the management of orbital cellulitis from the United Kingdom offer the following indications for CT scanning: inability to assess vision; proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, bilateral edema, or deteriorating visual acuity; lack of improvement after 24 hours of administration of intravenous antibiotics; &quot;swinging&quot; fevers not resolving within 36 hours; or signs or symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p>In the study of CT scanning in children with suspected acute preseptal or orbital cellulitis described above, the presence of edema beyond the eyelid margin or an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/microL</span> were independent risk factors for an orbital abscess; the authors concluded that the presence of either of these findings should necessitate an expedited evaluation, including emergent CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H459379613\" class=\"local\">'Orbital abscess'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, CT scanning should be done in all patients in whom surgical drainage is being considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-cellulitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Based on the studies and guidelines described above, we recommend that patients with suspected orbital cellulitis with any of the following features undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the orbits and sinuses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proptosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitation of eye movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with eye movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema extending beyond the eyelid margin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ANC &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs or symptoms of CNS involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to examine the patient fully (usually patients less than one year of age)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not begin to show improvement within 24 to 48 hours of initiating appropriate therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19539755\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiologic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the low yield, we recommend obtaining blood cultures from patients with suspected orbital cellulitis before the administration of antibiotics.

Preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis involve different anatomic sites, with preseptal cellulitis referring to infections of the soft tissues anterior to the orbital septum and orbital cellulitis referring to infections posterior to it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68971 \">figure 1</a>). Although the two entities may initially be confused with one another, it is important to distinguish between them because they have very different clinical implications. Preseptal cellulitis is generally a mild condition that rarely leads to serious complications, whereas orbital cellulitis may cause loss of vision and even loss of life. Orbital cellulitis can usually be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis by its clinical features (ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, and proptosis) and by imaging studies; in cases in which the distinction is not clear, clinicians should treat patients as though they have orbital cellulitis. Both conditions are more common in children than in adults. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common underlying factor that leads to orbital cellulitis is acute sinusitis, particularly ethmoid sinusitis; less common causes are ophthalmic surgery and orbital trauma. (See <a href=\"#H459379483\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital cellulitis is often a polymicrobial infection. The most commonly identified pathogens in orbital cellulitis are <em>Staphylococcus</em> <em>aureus</em> and streptococci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77104 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H459379521\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of orbital cellulitis is suspected clinically and can be confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning of the orbits and sinuses. During the initial evaluation, it is critical to distinguish preseptal cellulitis from the more serious orbital cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55123 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62818 \">table 2</a>). It is also important to evaluate for complications of orbital cellulitis, such as subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess, visual loss, and intracranial extension. Although both preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis typically cause eyelid swelling with or without erythema, features such as ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proptosis occur only with orbital cellulitis.
