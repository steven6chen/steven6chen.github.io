The choice depends upon the specific abnormality that is present, since a wide range of pacemaker functions have been developed to accommodate specific clinical needs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51504 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To facilitate the use and understanding of pacemakers, a standardized classification code has been developed. Most patients can be managed with one of two or three common modes (AAI, VVI, or DDD), with or without rate responsiveness.</p><p>Contemporary pacemakers are versatile and capable of the most commonly used pacing modes and basic functions (ie, mode switching and rate responsiveness). Some advanced features are available in selected devices.</p><p>Pacemaker nomenclature and the clinical application of common pacing modes and functions will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Five position code</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A three-letter code describing the basic function of the various pacing systems was first proposed in 1974 by a combined task force from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology and subsequently updated by a committee from the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) and the British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group (BPEG). The code, which has five positions, is designated the NBG code for pacing nomenclature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68327\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68327 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The code is generic and does not describe specific or unique functional characteristics for each device.

The letters are the same as those for the first position: &quot;A&quot; for atrium, &quot;V&quot; for ventricle, &quot;D&quot; for dual. An additional option &quot;O&quot; indicates an absence of sensing. Programmed in this mode, a device will pace automatically at a specified rate, ignoring any intrinsic rhythm. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Asynchronous pacing'</a> below.)</p><p>Manufacturers sometimes use &quot;S&quot; in the first and second positions to indicate that the device is capable of pacing only a single cardiac chamber.

This designation is restricted to dual-chamber systems. An event sensed in the atrium inhibits the atrial output but triggers a ventricular output.

Mode switching and rate responsiveness are available in all contemporary pacemakers. Some features are available in select devices and can be utilized as specific clinical situations demand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Mode switching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In dual-chamber pacing systems <span class=\"nowrap\">(DDD/DDDR</span> or less commonly, <span class=\"nowrap\">VDD/VDDR),</span> the ventricle will be paced following every sensed atrial event, up to a programmed maximum ventricular rate. If the patient develops a paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation), the ventricle would then be paced at this maximum programmed rate for the duration of the arrhythmia, which is obviously undesirable.</p><p>Mode switching refers to automatic reprogramming of a pacemaker to a mode that no longer tracks the intrinsic atrial rate, usually VVI, DDI, or DVI with or without rate responsiveness. When the sensed atrial rate again falls below the mode switching cutoff and the device assumes that a physiologic rhythm has been restored (ie, with termination of the arrhythmia), the pacing mode automatically reverts to the original programming.</p><p>All contemporary dual-chamber pacemakers have mode switching capabilities. This feature can be activated or disabled, depending upon the clinical situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Rate responsiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, rate responsiveness, also referred to as rate modulation or rate adaptation, refers to the ability of a pacemaker to adjust its programmed paced rate based upon patient activity. A variety of sensors have been designed to determine when a patient is physically active (eg, vibration, minute ventilation, change in right ventricular impedance). The range of heart rates, the pace of acceleration and deceleration, and the degree of activity required to initiate this response are all programmable in rate-adaptive pacing modes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Modes to minimize ventricular pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right ventricular (RV) pacing causes the right ventricle to contract before the left ventricle (LV), and causes the septum to contract before the lateral wall of the LV, simulating the effects of left bundle branch block. This phenomenon is referred to as ventricular dyssynchrony or asynchrony. Whether due to RV pacing or intrinsic conduction abnormalities, dyssynchrony can cause or exacerbate heart failure in some patients and increase the frequency of atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cardiac pacing in heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of pacemakers in the prevention of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Native atrioventricular (AV) conduction is hemodynamically preferable to RV pacing. With an increased understanding of the detrimental effects of RV pacing, efforts have been made to develop pacing modes that minimize ventricular pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Examples of novel pacing strategies for this purpose include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular avoidance pacing algorithms &ndash; A dual-chamber device can be programmed to pace AAI (allowing native conduction), but if specific criteria are met that signify a loss of AV conduction, the pacemaker will automatically switch to DDD pacing for some period of time until the algorithm once again determines the presence of intrinsic AV conduction. This approach has been associated with a markedly lower rate of frequency of ventricular pacing compared with conventional dual-chamber pacing (9 versus 99 percent and 4 versus 74 percent in two studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/3,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV search hysteresis &ndash; Algorithms exist that will prolong the programmed AV delay in a dual-chamber device to allow native conduction when present. The mechanism and frequency with which the algorithm allows AV prolongation to determine the presence of intrinsic AV conduction and the degree to which the AV delay can be extended are variable depending on manufacturer and model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If native conduction with a long PR or AR is present, the device will allow this to continue until the allowed interval is exceeded and there is no intrinsic QRS. This will generally reset the algorithm to the original programmed AV interval. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Biventricular pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients, ventricular dyssynchrony is unavoidable due to intrinsic conduction disease or inevitable ventricular pacing. If such a patient also has heart failure and LV dysfunction, synchrony may be restored with biventricular pacing, or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), which improves outcomes in selected patients. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with LV dysfunction and a mildly reduced ejection fraction (EF; eg, 36 to 49 percent) who have an indication for permanent pacing have traditionally received a standard dual-chamber pacemaker. However, given the potential for ventricular pacing (especially RV apical pacing) to cause or exacerbate LV dysfunction, it is believed that patients might have better outcomes if cardiac resynchronization therapy (ie, biventricular pacing) was the initially implanted device. One trial, BLOCK-HF, demonstrated that in patients with AV block and LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt;50 percent) with NYHA class I, II, or III heart failure, biventricular pacing was superior to conventional RV pacing for the primary outcome of time to death from any cause, urgent IV therapy for heart failure, or 15 percent or greater increase in LV end-systolic volume index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a post hoc analysis of the BLOCK-HF trial, patients in the biventricular pacing arm were more likely to have improvement in NYHA functional status and in a clinical composite score incorporating various clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to assess conventional pacing versus biventricular stimulation in patients with mildly reduced LV function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PACING MODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In selecting the ideal pacing mode, the patient's overall physical condition, associated medical problems, exercise capacity, left ventricular function, and chronotropic response to exercise must be considered along with the underlying rhythm disturbance. Some of the various ventricular and atrial pacing systems available and their NBG codes are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79459 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Single-chamber pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early pacemakers were designed to sense and pace in a single chamber. Ventricular pacing can prevent ventricular bradyarrhythmias or asystole of any etiology. Atrial pacing can be used in patients with isolated sinus node dysfunction or sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and intact AV conduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">VVI or VVIR pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular demand pacing (ventricle paced, ventricle sensed, and pacemaker inhibited in response to a sensed beat) remains the most commonly used pacing mode. Advantages of ventricular demand pacing include the requirement for only a single lead and the ability to protect the patient from dangerous bradycardias of any etiology. However, ventricular demand pacing cannot maintain AV synchrony, and lack of AV synchrony can result in pacemaker syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Pacemaker syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>Virtually all devices currently in use are capable of VVIR pacing. VVIR pacing is primarily indicated in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.</p><p>By contrast, in a patient with normal sinus rhythm, VVIR pacing should not be used as an excuse to forego attempts at placing an atrial lead. If sinus node function is intact, dual-chamber (DDD) pacing preserves AV synchrony and maintains the patient's natural heart rate response to activity. This approach is optimal and should be used whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic pacing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">AAI or AAIR pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial demand pacing (atrium paced, atrium sensed, and pacemaker inhibited in response to sensed atrial beat) is appropriate for patients with sinus node dysfunction who have intact AV nodal function. Patients with symptomatic sinus bradycardia or sinus pauses, but with an intact ability to accelerate their heart rate with exertion, can be programmed in an AAI mode. Those who cannot adequately accelerate their heart rate should have rate responsive capability available (ie, AAIR).</p><p>As with ventricular demand pacemakers, these devices have the benefit of requiring only a single lead. However, unlike ventricular single-chamber pacemakers, they will not protect patients from ventricular bradyarrhythmias due to AV conduction block. Due to this limitation, atrial demand pacemakers are infrequently used. Many clinicians are concerned that a patient who already has sinus node disease will later develop AV conduction disease. Although it would be uncommon for AV block to develop precipitously and result in a catastrophic event, gradual development of AV conduction system disease may require upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. Pacemaker upgrade can be technically more difficult than original placement of a dual-chamber pacemaker, and the second procedure obviously entails additional cost and patient risk.</p><p>However, if the patient with sinus node dysfunction is assessed carefully and does not have AV node disease at the time of pacemaker implant, the occurrence of clinically significant AV nodal disease is very low (less than 2 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Assessment prior to use of an AAI system should include incremental atrial pacing at the time of pacemaker implant. Although criteria vary among institutions and implanting clinicians, the adult patient should be capable of 1:1 AV nodal conduction to rates of 120 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Dual-chamber pacing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">DDD or DDDR pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dual-chamber (DDD) pacing system provides physiologic pacing (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic pacing'</a> below), with sensing and pacing capabilities in both the atrium and the ventricle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pacemaker will be totally inhibited in the presence of sinus rhythm with normal AV conduction if the sinus rate is faster than the programmed lower rate of the pacemaker and the intrinsic AV conduction is faster than the programmed AV interval.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is sinus bradycardia but normal AV conduction with the intrinsic QRS occurring before the end of the programmed AV interval, there will be atrial pacing with a native QRS complex following each paced atrial beat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both the atrium and ventricle will be paced if there is sinus bradycardia and delayed or absent AV conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ventricle will be paced synchronously with the atrium if there is normal sinus rhythm with delayed or absent AV conduction.</p><p/><p>As a result, there are four different rhythms that can be seen with normal pacemaker function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52858\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52858 \">waveform 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal sinus rhythm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial pacing, normally conducted to the ventricle with a native QRS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV sequential pacing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial sensing and ventricular pacing</p><p/><p>The DDD pacing mode is appropriate for patients with AV block who have normal sinus node function. DDD pacing is also considered by some to be the mode of choice in carotid sinus hypersensitivity with symptomatic cardioinhibition. However, most patients should receive a pacemaker capable of DDDR pacing, even if rate response is not initially programmed &quot;on.&quot;</p><p>The ideal patient for DDDR pacing is one with combined sinus nodal and AV nodal dysfunction in whom DDDR pacing would restore rate responsiveness and AV synchrony. DDDR pacing is also appropriate for patients with sinus node dysfunction and normal AV conduction. As noted above, many practitioners are not comfortable with AAIR pacing. Use of DDDR pacing mode with an algorithm that will minimize ventricular pacing is often preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">DDI or DDIR pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the DDI pacing mode, there is atrial sensing and pacing, and ventricular sensing and pacing; however, the pacemaker will not track intrinsic atrial activity. When there is a sensed native atrial rate, the pacemaker will inhibit both atrial and ventricular output, thereby allowing native conduction to the ventricle. If AV block develops, ventricular pacing will occur at a programmed rate, but will not be synchronized with the atrium.</p><p>As an example, if a device is programmed DDI at 50 beats per minute, and the patient has sinus rhythm at 60 with 1:1 AV conduction, the device will be fully inhibited. If AV block develops, the pacemaker will pace the ventricle at 50 beats per minute. If sinus bradycardia develops, the pacemaker will pace the atrium and ventricle synchronously at 50 beats per minute.</p><p>In the DDI mode, if the sinus rate is below the programmed rate, the pacemaker will pace the atrium and ventricle sequentially.</p><p>There are few, if any, advantages of DDI or DDIR pacing at this time. At one time, this mode was helpful for the patient with atrial tachyarrhythmias. Since DDI does not &quot;track,&quot; this mode would alleviate the concern of fast ventricular rates in response to the atrial tachyarrhythmia. However, this has become much less important since essentially all dual-chamber devices now have mode switching capability. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mode switching'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Less common modes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VDD and DVI mode remain programmable options in most pacemakers but are rarely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6312266\"><span class=\"h4\">VDD pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VDD pacing (ventricle paced, atrium and ventricle sensed, and either inhibition or tracking of the pacemaker in response to a sensed beat) may be appropriate for the patient with normal sinus node function and conduction disease of the AV node. Dual-chamber (two lead) VDD pacing systems have largely been supplanted by DDD pacemakers.</p><p>However, a single-lead VDD pacing system, now available for many years, has increased interest in the use of VDD as the initial pacing mode in patients with AV block but normal sinus node function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In these systems, atrial sensing is accomplished from &quot;floating&quot; sensing electrodes on the atrial portion of the ventricular pacing lead.</p><p>One limitation to the use of a single-lead VDD pacemaker is that patients with initially normal SA node function may develop sinus node dysfunction. This would then require a second procedure to place an atrial lead capable of pacing in order to maintain AV synchrony and chronotropic competence. However, this is an infrequent occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6312283\"><span class=\"h4\">DVI pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DVI pacemakers (atrium and ventricle paced, ventricular sensing only, and inhibition of pacemaker in response to sensed ventricular beat) are now of historical interest only. DVI pacing is, by definition, limited by the absence of atrial sensing, which prevents the restoration of rate responsiveness in the chronotropically competent patient. In addition, lack of atrial sensing may lead to competitive atrial pacing and initiation of atrial rhythm disturbances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Asynchronous pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pacemakers may be programmed to pace at a fixed rate, without attempting to sense or react to native cardiac activity. These modes are referred to as asynchronous pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">AOO, VOO, or DOO mode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In these modes, the atrium, ventricle, or both are paced, but the pacemaker has no sensing capability and hence there is no sensing response of the pacemaker.</p><p>Asynchronous pacing modes are rarely used long-term. These modes, however, may be temporarily necessary for patients who are undergoing a surgical procedure, especially if the patient is pacemaker-dependent. Electrocautery could be sensed by the pacemaker and misinterpreted as native cardiac activity, thereby inhibiting pacing output. This could produce significant bradycardia or asystole in a pacemaker-dependent patient.</p><p>Thus, prior to surgery, the pacemaker could be reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode that turns off its sensing capability. After surgery, the pacemaker should be reprogrammed to its prior mode. Alternatively, a magnet placed over the pacemaker will deactivate its ability to sense and, while left in place, will result in asynchronous pacing. Although this approach has been used for many years there are some concerns that are likely more theoretical than real.</p><p>Pacing in an asynchronous mode can be associated with competition between the native and the paced rhythms, with the possibility that a paced impulse will occur during a native T wave (or the vulnerable period). To reduce this risk, asynchronous pacing could be programmed to a relatively higher rate (&ge;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute)</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC PACING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic pacing is a term that has been used to describe pacing systems that most closely approximate normal cardiac behavior. It most commonly refers to systems that maintain AV synchrony (eg, AAI or DDD systems, in contrast to VVI systems), but has also been applied to rate responsive pacemakers.

The choice varies with the clinical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) who require a pacemaker due to slow ventricular response, we recommend a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker (VVI or VVIR) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with conditions that could be managed with either a single- or a dual-chamber pacemaker (eg, AV block, SSS), we suggest a dual-chamber pacemaker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic pacing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>A single-chamber pacemaker is a reasonable alternative in patients who are very elderly or whose anatomy and physical condition make the implantation of two leads more difficult than usual. In such cases, the additional costs and risks of a dual-chamber physiologic pacemaker may outweigh the potential benefits of the reduced risk of AF and patient preference. VVI(R) pacing will be effective in all such patients.</p><p>An AAI(R) pacemaker is a reasonable alternative to VVI(R) pacing in the subset of patients with SSS in whom AV conduction is intact and meets intraimplant testing criteria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Treatment&quot;</a>).
