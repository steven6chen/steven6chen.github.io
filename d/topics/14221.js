However, evidence suggests that B cell and plasma cell activation results in the generation of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), which bind to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or non-HLA molecules expressed on endothelial cells within the renal allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In acute ABMR, antibodies bind to graft endothelium and activate complement-dependent and -independent mechanisms that recruit natural killer (NK) cells, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, platelets, and macrophages, which contribute to peritubular capillaritis, glomerulitis, cellular necrosis, thrombotic microangiopathy, and a relatively rapid decline in allograft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Chronic ABMR, on the other hand, is a distinct pathophysiological process resulting from a repetitive pattern of thrombotic events and inflammatory changes that lead to endothelial cell injury and allograft matrix remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. It manifests histologically as transplant glomerulopathy and results in a slow and progressive decline in renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that the prevention and treatment of antibody-mediated injury requires a combination of strategies to inhibit B cell development, maturation, and activity. Despite a relatively large number of observational studies, it is not clear which combination therapy is the safest and most effective.</p><p>The prevention and treatment of acute and chronic ABMR of the renal allograft will be reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of ABMR and the treatment of acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection (TCMR) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection of the renal allograft&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821303944\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute and chronic ABMR are both associated with poor outcomes after kidney transplantation. Patients with acute ABMR are at increased risk for subsequent rejection, chronic ABMR, and graft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/1,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-14</a>]. Similarly, those with chronic ABMR have a higher risk for graft loss and patient death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/1-3,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,15,16</a>]. However, not all patients with ABMR have poor outcomes, and many patients maintain stable allograft function for years after treatment of the initial episode of rejection. Risk factors for graft loss in patients with ABMR are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H381378151\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some histopathological features on the renal biopsy at the time of rejection are associated with worse outcomes. As an example, concurrent, acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection (TCMR) is an independent risk factor for graft failure in patients with ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There is also a clear and independent association between microvascular injury and C4d staining (including focal C4d staining in post-reperfusion biopsies) with poor outcomes in acute or chronic ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Similarly, transplant glomerulopathy and the degree of chronic injury (measured semiquantitatively by adding chronic interstitial, tubular, vascular, and glomerular Banff scores) are associated with worse graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/15,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1250704257\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor-specific antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain characteristics of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) have been associated with poor outcomes among patients with ABMR. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DSA strength &ndash; In a study of 402 consecutive, deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients, the risk for both ABMR and graft loss directly correlated with peak preexisting anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DSA strength, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with a peak anti-HLA DSA MFI of &gt;6000 had a more than 100-fold higher risk for developing ABMR compared with those with an MFI of &lt;465. Graft survival in patients with a peak anti-HLA DSA MFI of &gt;3000 was lower than that of patients with an MFI of &le;3000.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DSA subclass &ndash; The immunoglobulin subclass of DSA may also predict outcomes. In a study of 125 patients with DSAs detected in the first year posttransplant, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) immunodominant DSA was associated with later allograft injury, increased allograft glomerulopathy, and interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/tubular</span> atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">(IF/TA)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. By contrast, IgG3 immunodominant DSA was associated with a shorter time to rejection, increased microvascular injury, C4d capillary deposition, and graft failure. These findings suggest that IgG immunodominant DSA subclasses may identify distinct phenotypes of renal allograft antibody-mediated injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement-binding capacity &ndash; The ability of anti-HLA DSAs to bind complement, as determined by the C1q assay, may identify patients at high risk for renal allograft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, one study showed that the C1q-binding activity of DSAs largely reflects differences in antibody strength, questioning the biologic significance of the C1q assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DSA type &ndash; The type of DSA (preexisting or de novo) may also be a predictor of worse outcomes in patients with ABMR. ABMR in patients with a de novo DSA, which is thought to be mostly related to medication nonadherence or inadequate immunosuppression, has been associated with poorer outcomes compared with ABMR in patients with preexisting DSA (ie, presensitized patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/1,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28-30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1595661243\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of renal allograft dysfunction at the time of renal biopsy appears to be directly associated with poor outcomes in patients with ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/15,21,28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21,28,31</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 205 patients with biopsy-proven ABMR, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at diagnosis and a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of &ge;0.30 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/g</span> at the time of biopsy were identified as independent determinants of allograft loss (hazard ratio [HR] 3.27 and 2.44, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In another study of 123 patients with chronic ABMR, a serum creatinine of &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/g</span> at the time of diagnosis were independently associated with graft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other observational studies have reported similar findings among patients with acute and chronic ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/21,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2063905328\"><span class=\"h2\">Other risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expression of endothelial cell-associated transcripts (ENDATs) and DSA-selective transcripts has been shown to be a biomarker of active antibody-mediated injury and may predict worse graft outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>]. These molecular assays, which are not yet in mainstream clinical practice, reflect changes in microcirculatory endothelium not normally detected by routine histopathology and DSA testing and may improve risk stratification and prognostication in patients with ABMR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3027658955\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the prevention of ABMR depends upon the detection of donor-specific antibody (DSA) prior to (preexisting DSA) or after (de novo DSA) transplant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64238091\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with preexisting DSA before transplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a preexisting DSA prior to transplant have a greater risk for ABMR and graft loss compared with nonsensitized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. This risk is proportional to the strength of DSA as patients with a positive complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch have a higher risk of ABMR and graft loss than those with a positive flow crossmatch, who in turn have a higher risk than patients with a positive virtual crossmatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/33,34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,36</a>].</p><p>Although a common approach to prevent ABMR has been to avoid transplanting highly sensitized patients, this option renders chronic dialysis the only therapeutic option, with significant implications for patient health and quality of life and health care costs. Long-term survival in renal transplant recipients has improved considerably with desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], which can be used to reduce the level of DSAs pretransplant. In addition, the enrollment of patients in special programs to optimize matching can lead to timely transplants with better outcomes.

Such PKE programs (including the National Kidney Registry, the Alliance for Paired Donation, and the United Network for Organ Sharing [UNOS] Kidney Paired Donations Pilot Program) enable sensitized patients with immunologically incompatible living donors to be transplanted with high-quality grafts from other living donors in similar situations who are willing to exchange organs. Although cost has been a concern for kidney exchange registries in the United States, PKE could help participating centers to avoid complex desensitization protocols while improving long-term outcomes. Mathematical modeling has predicted that an optimized matching algorithm and a national PKE program would improve graft outcomes and reduce health care costs for highly sensitized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In patients with a significant rise in DSA or who develop a de novo DSA within the first three months, we perform a renal allograft biopsy. This practice is largely consistent with the recommendations of the Consensus Guidelines on the Testing and Clinical Management Issues Associated with HLA and Non-HLA Antibodies in Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

As mentioned above, ABMR in patients with a de novo DSA has been associated with poorer outcomes compared with ABMR in patients with preexisting DSA (see <a href=\"#H1250704257\" class=\"local\">'Donor-specific antibodies'</a> above). The two most common causes of ABMR due to a de novo DSA are medication nonadherence and inadequate immunosuppression, the latter of which is frequently attributed to the use of minimization strategies. In addition, acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection (TCMR), malignancy, and opportunistic infections (such as BK polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection) that require a reduction in immunosuppression may also influence the development of late-onset ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/1,2,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,45,46</a>].</p><p>Prevention of ABMR should focus on addressing nonadherence and under-immunosuppression while balancing the safety and efficacy of long-term immunosuppression.

In general, we treat <strong>all</strong> patients who have evidence of acute ABMR on biopsy.

We prefer an every-other-day plasmapheresis schedule as albumin alone can often be administered for replacement with interval recovery of the prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen to acceptable levels without the need to administer fresh frozen plasma. This avoids the risk of antigen sensitization; however, one to two units of fresh frozen plasma may be used for replacement at the end of a plasmapheresis treatment if indicated by preprocedure laboratory values or in the appropriate clinical setting, such as a same-day renal allograft biopsy.

Some transplant centers combine desensitization and PKE. In patients with a positive virtual crossmatch or a mild-to-moderate flow crossmatch (ie, median channel shift of &lt;200), we employ human leukocyte antigen (HLA) desensitization strategies, which include treatment with plasmapheresis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (rATG)-Thymoglobulin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In patients <strong>without </strong>a potential living donor, we employ HLA desensitization strategies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In <strong>all </strong>patients with a preexisting DSA before transplant who undergo kidney transplantation, we use induction and maintenance immunosuppression therapies that are appropriate for patients at <strong>high risk</strong> for the development of acute rejection.

Typically, maintenance immunosuppression is also augmented by increasing the daily dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients without any decrease in serum creatinine after seven days of rejection treatment are considered to have failed initial treatment. In such patients, ongoing rejection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> another cause of renal allograft dysfunction should be suspected, and a repeat renal allograft biopsy should be performed. Our subsequent approach depends upon the histopathological and clinical findings of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H2755308070\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic ABMR, the most common cause of graft failure, is more difficult to treat than acute ABMR since irreversible tissue damage has already occurred to the renal allograft. It is not clear which combination therapy is safe and effective in patients with chronic ABMR. We treat all patients with evidence of chronic ABMR using a combination of glucocorticoids and IVIG. We add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to the treatment regimen if there is evidence of active microvascular inflammation on renal biopsy. We do <strong>not</strong> use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> in the treatment of chronic ABMR.
