In most circumstances, emergency clinicians use rapid sequence intubation (RSI) to accomplish this task. RSI involves the administration of an induction agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent to create optimal intubating conditions and minimize the time the airway is unprotected. RSI presupposes the patient is at risk for aspiration of stomach contents and incorporates medications and techniques to minimize this risk. Use of RSI also helps to mitigate the potential adverse effects of airway manipulation.</p><p>This topic reviews the central concepts and techniques needed to perform RSI in adults in the emergency setting outside the operating room. RSI for anesthesia, RSI in children, the medications used for emergency RSI, and other subjects related to emergency airway management are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For medications used for RSI in adults: (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For RSI in children: (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-of-the-operating-room-in-children-medications-for-sedation-and-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside of the operating room in children: Medications for sedation and paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For basic and advanced airway management: (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSI is the virtually simultaneous administration of an induction agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent to induce unconsciousness and neuromuscular paralysis to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation. The technique is designed to maximize the likelihood of successful intubation and to minimize the risk of aspiration. For most patients, preoxygenation and hemodynamic optimization precede drug administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preoxygenation is a crucial step of RSI that creates a large intrapulmonary reservoir of oxygen that allows patients to tolerate a sufficient period of apnea without clinically significant oxygen desaturation. By design, bag-mask ventilation is generally avoided during the interval between drug administration and tracheal tube placement, thereby minimizing gastric insufflation and reducing the risk of aspiration. RSI has been shown to be associated with increased first pass success (ie, successful tracheal tube placement on first attempt) and reduced incidence of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, since the induction agent is pushed rapidly, critically ill patients are at risk for the development of hypotension, which is mitigated by optimizing cardiovascular status prior to RSI whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSI is the most common emergency method for securing control of the airway in critically ill patients not anticipated to be difficult intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of RSI in the critically ill patient, with improved first pass success and reduced incidence of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/1,2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,10</a>]. RSI may also be the preferred approach in a patient with an anatomically difficult airway if the intubator is confident that gas exchange can be maintained, either by successful intubation or by use of a rescue device. In an observational registry study of emergency department intubations, 80 percent of predicted difficult airways were managed with RSI using a videolaryngoscope with a high first pass success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When performing RSI in a patient with an airway predicted to be difficult, the clinician must have immediate access to the equipment necessary to restore oxygenation. Such equipment generally includes a bag and mask device, extraglottic airway, and a surgical airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to RSI are relative. The most important contraindication to RSI is anticipation of intubation difficulty, particularly if rescue oxygenation is also thought to be difficult or impossible. In addition, when a patient cannot tolerant apnea (eg, profound hypoxemia or metabolic acidosis is present), neuromuscular blockade may be undesirable and an &quot;awake&quot; intubation approach (ie, use of topical anesthesia and light sedation) preferred in order to minimize the likelihood of precipitous deterioration. </p><p>Depending on clinical circumstances, particular sedative or neuromuscular blocking agents may be selected or avoided to minimize the risk of potential side effects. The effects of particular drugs used for RSI are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DESCRIPTION OF THE TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful RSI depends upon proper preparation, planning, and detailed considerations during multiple steps. The updated &quot;Seven P's of RSI&quot; is a mnemonic that outlines these key steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77060 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoxygenation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preintubation optimization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paralysis with induction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positioning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placement with proof</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postintubation management</p><p/><p>Each step is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparation includes assessing the patient's airway for potential difficulty, developing an airway management plan (including a backup plan), and assembling all necessary personnel, equipment, and medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79150 \">table 2</a>). A discussion of the steps needed to prepare for intubation is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;, section on 'Preparation'</a>.)</p><p>Once the need for intubation is determined, and prior to committing to RSI as the method of intubation, the clinician assesses the patient for anatomic features and clinical findings that indicate the patient may be difficult to intubate or to ventilate using a bag-mask, or in whom it may be difficult to use a rescue airway, such as an extraglottic device. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the presence of markers for difficult intubation or difficult bag-mask ventilation is not an absolute contraindication to RSI, if such features are identified, alternatives to RSI may be preferred. In addition, an assessment must be performed for the presence of any physiologic problems posing an increased risk of cardiovascular collapse after the administration of RSI medications and transition to positive pressure ventilation. Hypoxemia and hypotension must be recognized and, if possible, corrected before RSI medications are given. Right ventricular failure and severe metabolic acidosis are less common conditions, but they too can cause rapid physiologic deterioration with RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis may experience a precipitous deterioration during even brief periods of apnea as compensatory elimination of carbon dioxide is halted. Severe asthma, active myocardial ischemia, tachydysrhythmias, and all forms of shock require a tailored approach that results in successful tube placement and minimal risk of hypoxic insult or circulatory collapse. (See <a href=\"#H447277169\" class=\"local\">'Preintubation optimization'</a> below.) </p><p>If an anatomically difficult airway is predicted, rapid desaturation is anticipated, or severe hemodynamic compromise is identified, RSI may not be the best approach to achieve airway control. Instead, an &quot;awake technique&quot; in which the patient is intubated with topical anesthesia, and sometimes light sedation, rather than unconsciousness and paralysis, may be preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The benefit of the awake approach is that the patient continues spontaneous ventilation and thereby the dangers of apnea and hemodynamic compromise associated with the induction medications used for RSI are avoided. However, awake intubation has potential drawbacks. It may be poorly tolerated by the patient, requires adequate time for topical anesthesia, secretion control and (often) sedation, and takes longer to achieve intubation. </p><p>Deciding between RSI and awake intubation is often a difficult decision and the operator must carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach in the particular patient, including available equipment and pharmacologic agents, to determine the best course. Discussions of how to determine the need for intubation and how to identify airways that are potentially difficult to intubate or ventilate are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to proceeding with RSI, at least one, but preferably two, functioning intravenous (IV) lines should be in place, as should cardiac and blood pressure monitors, pulse oximetry, and end tidal capnography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient should be in an appropriate area within the emergency department (ED) where all necessary airway and resuscitation equipment are available. The airway manager should have easy access to the head of the bed, and should adjust the height of the bed and position of the patient to facilitate intubation. The equipment and steps necessary to prepare for and perform tracheal intubation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H1753778712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>The clinician selects the induction and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) to be used and determines the doses. Allergies and potential contraindications should be considered carefully. The medications to be used are drawn up into labeled syringes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important goal of preparation is to maximize the chances for successful intubation on the first attempt. Studies suggest that the risk of an adverse event during tracheal intubation (eg, aspiration, hypotension, esophageal intubation) increases significantly with the number of attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As an example, one observational ED study of 1828 intubations reported that 14 percent of patients intubated on the first pass experienced an adverse event compared to 47 percent of those intubated on the second attempt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoxygenation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475880155\"><span class=\"h3\">General guidelines and common scenarios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoxygenation combined with continuous apneic oxygenation (see below) increases the safety of RSI. Any patient requiring urgent tracheal intubation should be preoxygenated with high flow oxygen at the highest possible concentration for a minimum of 3 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Preoxygenation replaces mixed gases (mostly nitrogen) in the gas-exchanging portions of the lung (functional residual capacity [FRC]) with oxygen thereby creating a large oxygen reservoir and significantly delaying oxygen desaturation during the apneic period of RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Researchers have characterized the expected time to desaturation after apnea is induced in properly preoxygenated patients of various ages and comorbid conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56716 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Under ideal circumstances, a healthy 70 kg adult can maintain oxygen saturation above 90 percent for approximately 8 minutes during apnea. Young children typically fall below the 90 percent threshold in less than 4 minutes. The oxygen saturation of adults with severe illness or obesity, and pregnant women nearing the end of their third trimester, falls below 90 percent in less than 3 minutes despite optimal preoxygenation.</p><p>The important concept is that preoxygenation provides a longer period before clinically significant desaturation, regardless of the patient's condition, age, and body habitus. Continuous monitoring of oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry is essential during RSI. When assessing oxygen saturation, remember that pulse oximetry readings obtained with a finger probe may lag behind the central arterial circulation, particularly in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25</a>].</p><p>There are multiple ways to perform preoxygenation in the critically ill depending on the scenario:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inadequate spontaneous ventilation</strong> &#8210; In the patient with inadequate spontaneous ventilation, preoxygenation should be performed using gentle positive pressure ventilation with a bag-valve mask (BVM) and an oxygen flow rate of 15 L per minute (LPM) using an assist technique, synchronous, if possible, with the patient's spontaneous inspirations. It is important to ventilate these patients with pressures less than 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to avoid gastric insufflation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adequate spontaneous ventilation and cooperative</strong> &#8210; In patients with adequate spontaneous ventilation who are cooperative, a BVM (with functional one-way inspiratory and expiratory valves) and an oxygen flow rate of 15 LPM can be used for preoxygenation. It is not necessary to squeeze the bag, but a tight mask seal must be achieved in order to limit room air admixture and maintain a high FiO<sub>2</sub>. If circumstances do not permit several minutes of preoxygenation, eight vital capacity breaths may be used in cooperative patients and will provide adequate preoxygenation in less than 1 minute. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adequate spontaneous ventilation but uncooperative</strong> &#8210; In patients who are uncooperative, cannot tolerate breathing through a BVM device, or for whom a good face mask seal cannot be achieved, a nonrebreather (NRB) mask with flush rate oxygen is a reasonable option for preoxygenation. Traditional flow rates of 15 LPM provide inadequate preoxygenation since leak around the margin of the mask limits the FiO<sub>2</sub> to around 65 percent. Flush rate oxygen (&ge;50 LPM) should be used when preoxygenating with a NRB mask</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Oxygen provided at the flush rate outcompetes room air entrainment around the margin of the mask and increases the FiO<sub>2</sub> to 90 percent or more, thereby providing maximal nitrogen washout and a larger oxygen reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, flush rates of oxygen vary considerably among hospitals, and flow rates as low as 20 LPM have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Thus, if a NRB mask is used it is recommended that the standard 15 LPM oxygen flow meter be replaced with a flow meter calibrated to 70 LPM so the exact flow can be controlled. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2441861935\"><span class=\"h3\">Right-to-left intrapulmonary shunting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When air-space disease (eg, pneumonia, ARDS) causes significant right-to-left intrapulmonary shunting, the above methods of preoxygenation may not be effective. Patients with such shunting require positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to promote alveolar recruitment and maximize the efficacy of preoxygenation efforts. Although a BVM with a PEEP valve may be used, we recommend noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The use of noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure and the benefits of positive pressure ventilation to improve preoxygenation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a patient cannot tolerate NIV for preoxygenation, the use of a high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) system (eg, OptiFlow) is a reasonable alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. HFNC equipment is not readily available in most EDs and the results of studies evaluating its ability to mitigate desaturation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients have been mixed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults#H2427430\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'High flow'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3902840947\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed sequence intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients that cannot tolerate any type of preoxygenation, a delayed sequence intubation (DSI) technique may be attempted. DSI involves the administration of a dissociative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, intended to sedate the patient sufficiently to achieve preoxygenation without depressing respiratory drive. Studies of DSI are limited, and the safety of this technique has not been demonstrated, nor is it known whether this approach reduces adverse events compared to RSI in such patients. In particular, it is not known whether DSI is safer than providing oxygenation via positive pressure using a BVM beginning immediately after induction (see <a href=\"#H3397071694\" class=\"local\">'Adjunct strategies'</a> below). In a small observational study, patients managed with DSI showed improvements in preoxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Great care must be taken when using a DSI approach as even a small dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> in the critically ill can cause apnea or hypotension.

Alternatively, 30 degree reverse Trendelenburg positioning (bed kept straight but angled with patient's head up) may be used for immobilized patients. The benefits of the head-up or ramp position for obese patients are discussed separately.

As passive oxygenation is a simple, low cost intervention, we encourage its routine use during emergency intubation, particularly if intubation is anticipated to be difficult or prolonged, or the patient has reduced oxygen reserves. It should be used with care in patients that may be sensitive to the effects of hypercarbia, such as those with intracranial hypertension, metabolic acidosis and pulmonary hypertension. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In several randomized trials involving stable surgical patients, passive oxygenation has been found to extend the safe apnea time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. However, the efficacy of passive oxygenation in the critically ill is more controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. Some observational studies have demonstrated a benefit of passive oxygenation in reducing the incidence of hypoxemia during emergency intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], but two randomized trials, one in the ICU and one in the ED, found that apneic oxygenation did not reduce the prevalence of desaturation during intubation. Of note, in the ED study, nearly all patients were intubated in less than 120 seconds, likely eliminating any impact from apneic oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Meta-analyses of studies of passive oxygenation suggest benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Apneic oxygenation was associated with decreased prevalence of desaturation and increased first pass intubation success. The latter finding is likely the result of more time for laryngoscopy and tracheal tube placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gentle ventilation for patients who cannot tolerate apnea</strong> &#8210; Many patients who are physiologically compromised (eg, hypotension, acidosis) but require emergency intubation have a greatly reduced tolerance for apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. In such cases, the clinician may wish to perform a modified RSI technique that includes giving gentle manual positive pressure ventilation during the &quot;apneic&quot; period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Alternatively, RSI can be avoided altogether and an awake intubation performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Whenever possible, it is important to address underlying physiologic compromise prior to RSI. (See <a href=\"#H447277169\" class=\"local\">'Preintubation optimization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Techniques to increase airway patency</strong> &#8210; If necessary, patency of the upper airway can be maintained with adjuncts (nasal or oropharyngeal airways) and positioning maneuvers (chin lift <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> jaw thrust). The chin lift is not used when spinal precautions are being observed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;, section on 'Airway maneuvers'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447277169\"><span class=\"h2\">Preintubation optimization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may be challenging to intubate for anatomic reasons, such as airway obstruction or direct airway trauma, or physiologic reasons, such as acidosis or hypotension. While septic shock, lactic acidosis, and right heart failure do not make the act of laryngoscopy and tracheal tube placement more difficult, they can contribute to operator stress and patient morbidity by minimizing the time available to intubate safely or by placing the patient at risk for peri-intubation circulatory collapse after receiving induction agents. </p><p>Preintubation optimization involves recognizing and addressing areas of physiologic vulnerability that may complicate resuscitative efforts, even if tracheal intubation goes quickly and smoothly. If the need for intubation is not immediate, abnormal hemodynamic parameters should be treated with the goal of optimizing conditions prior to intubation, given time constraints. A simple example would be rapid infusion of packed red blood cells or decompression of a hemopneumothorax for a hypotensive blunt trauma victim before initiating intubation. </p><p>The most commonly encountered physiologic problem in patients requiring emergency intubation is hypotension. Bleeding, dehydration, sepsis, and acute cardiac disease are common emergency conditions that can result in peri-intubation complications and morbidity, despite successful tracheal tube placement. All induction agents can cause peripheral vasodilation and myocardial depression. Therefore, patients with poor pump function, depleted intravascular volume, or ongoing bleeding can suffer profound refractory shock or circulatory collapse after RSI drugs are administered. The risk is compounded by subsequent positive pressure ventilation, which reduces blood pressure further by compromising venous return. </p><p>Depending on the cause of hypotension and the available time, isotonic crystalloid, blood products, and a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine, can be used to address hypotension and increase the pharmacologic options for RSI. Oxygenation efforts are reassessed during this step and escalated as necessary. While less common, hypertensive crises can be prevented or treated with sympatholytic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) prior to laryngeal manipulation and tube placement, both of which are known to cause sympathetic stimulation during intubation.

Agent selection and dosing are aimed at producing a state of deep sedation and muscular relaxation quickly. RSI does <strong>NOT</strong> involve titration of either agent to reach this state. The dose of each agent is precalculated to achieve the desired effect. Onset of action after administration is variable depending on the agent chosen, but the goal is to achieve intubation level paralysis and sedation 45 to 60 seconds after the drugs are given by IV push.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Induction agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal induction agent for RSI acts quickly to provide a deep state of unconsciousness and analgesia without causing hemodynamic side effects.

Bag-mask ventilation is unnecessary if the patient has been successfully preoxygenated. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Preoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, bagging between paralysis and intubation creates a potential hazard if gastric insufflation results in regurgitation and aspiration. Provided oxygen saturation remains above 92 percent, bag-mask ventilation is unnecessary, even between laryngoscopy attempts. If the patient's saturation percentage falls below 92, or is unknown, clinicians provide ventilatory support using a bag-mask.</p><p>Although it was once widely recommended and used during RSI, we no longer recommend external cricoid pressure (Sellick's maneuver). The use of cricoid pressure during RSI for anesthesia is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia#H74035\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Cricoid pressure'</a>). Sellick's maneuver may reduce gastric insufflation during bag-mask ventilation, but there is no convincing evidence that cricoid pressure reduces the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents during intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Several studies suggest it may contribute to airway obstruction and difficulty intubating in some cases, even when a video laryngoscope is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/48,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51-54</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of cricoid pressure studies noted the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Case series and retrospective reviews describe both the success and failure of cricoid pressure to prevent aspiration.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cricoid pressure is often used inconsistently and applied improperly in all airway management settings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cricoid pressure may impair the function of the lower esophageal sphincter.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possible risks from cricoid pressure include movement of unstable cervical spine fractures and esophageal injury.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Placement with proof</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After neuromuscular relaxation is achieved, as assessed by masseter muscle tone (ie, laxity of the jaw with no resistance to mouth opening), laryngoscopy can be performed. The time to muscular relaxation will vary depending on the NMBA used. When used with an appropriate induction agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> generally produces excellent intubating conditions within 45 seconds, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>, which does so in 60 seconds. If the patient is not felt to have achieved full neuromuscular paralysis at 45 or 60 seconds, we recommend waiting an additional 15 to 30 seconds for this to occur. </p><p>The goal of laryngoscopy is clear visualization of the glottic aperture. Once the glottis is visualized, the clinician places the endotracheal tube (ETT) between the vocal cords, inflates the cuff, withdraws the stylette, and confirms placement. The performance of laryngoscopy is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H1753778712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Confirmation of proper ETT placement is crucial; unrecognized esophageal intubation leads to devastating complications. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) determination (either colorimetric or quantitative) is the most accurate means of confirming ETT placement in most circumstances, and we recommend it be used with every intubation. Clinical indicators alone, such as visualization of the ETT through the cords, misting of the tube with ventilation, and auscultation of breath sounds over the lung fields, <strong>CANNOT</strong> be relied upon to confirm proper ETT placement. A single-view chest radiograph is only useful to determine depth of placement (eg, tracheal versus right mainstem). It is not useful for distinguishing endotracheal from esophageal intubation. The methods for proving proper ETT placement are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;, section on 'Confirming proper tracheal tube placement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Postintubation management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSI remains incomplete until the properly placed ETT is secured. Several techniques are commonly used to secure the tube, including taping, tying, and using proprietary tube-holders. The technique employed for ED airway management should be readily available, easy to apply, and secure. A post-procedural chest radiograph is obtained to confirm depth of tube placement and to evaluate for evidence of barotrauma as a consequence of positive pressure ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is initiated. Ventilator settings may need modification according to clinical circumstance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults#H959899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;, section on 'Post-intubation management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Disease-specific ventilatory management'</a>.)</p><p>Minor reductions in oxygen saturation and blood pressure may be observed in the immediate post-intubation period as a result of apnea and administration of the induction agent. If this does not rebound quickly with fluids and positive pressure ventilation, or if previously stable vitals signs suddenly deteriorate after tube placement, the clinician should quickly search for signs of a peri-intubation adverse event. These may include pneumothorax, tracheal tube cuff rupture, mucus plugging, or esophageal intubation &#160;</p><p>If long-term paralysis is needed, the timing of subsequent doses of both paralytic and sedative agents should be anticipated. Providing both long-term analgesia and sedation is important given the relatively short duration of action of the agents frequently used for RSI and the ability of paralysis to obscure the patient's capacity to communicate pain or distress. Appropriate sedation, guided by a sedation scale, often obviates the need for neuromuscular paralysis to permit mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although RSI provides optimal conditions for laryngoscopy, it is not without possible drawbacks. Many critically patients suffer from hypoxemia or hypotension during the peri-intubation period. To minimize the risk of these complications, patients should be physiologically optimized prior to intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/15,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,55</a>]. Properly performed preoxygenation using the most appropriate methods given the clinical circumstances is the most important measure that can be undertaken to prevent desaturation. Apneic oxygenation can be used to prolong the safe apnea time. The administration of IV fluids, blood products, and vasopressors, as clinically indicated, to optimize hemodynamics is recommended prior to intubation. (See <a href=\"#H447277169\" class=\"local\">'Preintubation optimization'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) uses a rapidly acting induction agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) to create optimal intubating conditions and enable rapid control of the airway. RSI presupposes the patient is at risk for aspiration of gastric contents and incorporates medications and techniques to minimize this risk. The basic approach to RSI consists of the &quot;Seven P's&quot; as outlined below and in the text.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparation &ndash; Assess the patient for anatomic features or clinical findings that indicate the patient may be difficult to intubate or to ventilate using a bag-mask. Make an airway management plan, including a backup approach, based on the clinical scenario. Gather equipment and medications. Necessary equipment is described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoxygenation &ndash; We recommend that any patient who requires tracheal intubation should be given high flow oxygen immediately at the highest possible concentration. In addition, we suggest that apneic oxygenation be provided to all patients being managed with RSI. Strategies to maximize preoxygenation are provided in the text. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Preoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preoxygenation creates an oxygen reservoir in the lungs, blood, and tissues that enables patients to tolerate a longer period of apnea without desaturation. The oxygen saturation of adults with severe illness or obesity, and pregnant women nearing the end of their third trimester, falls below 90 percent in less than 3 minutes, even if ideal preoxygenation is achieved. Time to desaturation in emergency practice is often more rapid than anticipated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preintubation optimization &ndash; Unless the need for intubation is immediate, patients undergoing emergency intubation should be physiologically optimized prior to initiation of the procedure. This includes hemodynamic optimization with IV fluids, blood products, and vasopressors as necessary, relief of hemopneumothorax and hemostasis for trauma patients, and maximal preoxygenation. (See <a href=\"#H447277169\" class=\"local\">'Preintubation optimization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paralysis with induction &ndash; RSI involves the virtually simultaneous IV administration of a rapidly acting induction agent and a NMBA aimed at producing a state of deep sedation and muscular relaxation quickly.
