It usually comes back to normal when the baby is fed breast milk or formula. If blood sugar stays low after feeding, a baby might need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29665088\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of newborn hypoglycemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many babies do not have any symptoms. Some babies have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking or trembling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak or flabby muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting irritable or cranky</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting sleepy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing problems, such as fast breathing or stopping breathing at times</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that looks blue, feels cold, or both</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sucking on a breast or bottle (Some babies eat less than normal.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29665103\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for newborn hypoglycemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A blood test can measure how much sugar is in the blood. Doctors can order this test if a baby has symptoms of newborn hypoglycemia, or has a higher risk of the condition. For example, if a baby is premature or the mother has diabetes, the baby is at higher risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29665118\"><span class=\"h1\">How is newborn hypoglycemia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All newborn babies need breast milk or formula soon after birth. This can help keep hypoglycemia from happening.</p><p>Babies at higher risk of newborn hypoglycemia should be fed breast milk or formula within 1 hour of birth. A doctor or nurse will do blood tests to keep track of how much sugar is in the blood.</p><p>If a baby has low blood sugar but no symptoms, doctors might give sugar in the form of gel. The gel goes inside the baby's cheek. This is followed by a feeding, with breast milk if possible. The gel followed by a feeding reduce the risk that the baby's blood sugar will drop again.</p><p>If a baby has symptoms of newborn hypoglycemia, or still has low blood sugar after feeding, doctors might give a sugar mixture through an &quot;IV.&quot; (An IV is a thin tube that goes into a vein.) This gets sugar into the baby's bloodstream right away.</p><p>Most babies only need the sugar mixture for a short time. If a baby needs it after he or she is 3 or 4 days old, the doctor might order more tests. Depending on the results, he or she might give the baby medicine or do surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29665132\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-during-pregnancy-for-women-with-type-1-or-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
