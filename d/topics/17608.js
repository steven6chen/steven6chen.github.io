Typically, GBS presents as an acute monophasic paralyzing illness provoked by a preceding infection. The main modalities of therapy for GBS are intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> and plasma exchange. Even before initiating therapy, common questions that arise include whether the patient needs intensive care, assisted ventilation, or other supportive measures.</p><p>This topic will discuss the management and prognosis of GBS in children. Other aspects of GBS in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89028660\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features and diagnosis of GBS are reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the prototype of GBS, and is the most common form in North America, Europe and most of the developed world. Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is a pure motor form of GBS. It occurs mainly in northern China, but is also a common variant of GBS in other locations, including Japan, Mexico, and South America. The clinical presentation is similar in the two types. In most cases, neurologic symptoms develop two to four weeks after what initially appears to be a benign febrile respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. The predominant symptoms of GBS at presentation in children are pain and gait difficulty. Lower extremity symmetric weakness may ascend over hours to days to involve the arms, and the muscles of respiration in severe cases. In those with cranial neuropathy, the facial nerve is most commonly affected, resulting in bilateral facial weakness. Autonomic dysfunction occurs in approximately one-half of children with GBS. Physical examination reveals symmetric weakness with diminished or absent reflexes. Most patients reach the nadir of their function within two to four weeks, followed by a slow return of function over the course of weeks to months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Electrophysiologic studies are the most specific and sensitive tests for diagnosis of GBS. Characteristic findings from lumbar puncture include a normal opening pressure and cerebrospinal fluid with fewer than 10 cells (typically mononuclear) and an elevated protein concentration (&gt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Spinal MRI with administration of gadolinium frequently shows enhancement of the spinal nerve roots and cauda equina during the first weeks after the onset of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the initial phase of GBS, all patients require close monitoring of motor, autonomic (ie, blood pressure, heart rate and sphincter function), and respiratory function. Serial pulmonary function testing should be performed routinely. In most cases, pulmonary function monitoring (ie, vital capacity and maximum inspiratory pressure) should be performed every four hours at the bedside. All children, particularly those who are too young to cooperate with pulmonary testing, should be closely monitored and observed for fatigue and other clinical signs of impending respiratory muscle failure, as discussed below. </p><p>Patients should be electively intubated if clinical evaluation or pulmonary function tests suggest impending respiratory failure. Vigilance is essential since respiratory deterioration can occur rapidly. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Need for assisted ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p>Mortality is often due to complications such as nosocomial infection, acute respiratory arrest, deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. Outcomes can be optimized with meticulous care in the intensive care unit to identify patients progressing to respiratory failure early and to prevent hospital-acquired complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for intensive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with any of the following problems should be admitted urgently to a pediatric intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flaccid quadriparesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly progressive weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced vital capacity (&le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulbar palsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant autonomic instability</p><p/><p>Less severely affected patients can be managed in intermediate care units if available, and mildly affected patients whose trajectory is stable can be managed on the general ward, preferably with cardiac telemetry, along with monitoring of blood pressure and vital capacity every four hours. Hospitalization is continued until the child's condition has clearly stabilized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for assisted ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of children with GBS require mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The need for tracheal intubation should be anticipated so that it can be performed as an elective procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Children with a vital capacity approximately one-half the normal value for age or &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of body weight generally progress to require ventilatory support. In a study of patients with GBS that included some children, serial measurements of pulmonary function were most helpful for detecting the risk of developing respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Progression to requiring mechanical ventilation was more likely in patients with rapidly increasing weakness, bulbar dysfunction, bilateral facial weakness, or dysautonomia.</p><p>The following parameters warn of impending respiratory arrest and are an indication for urgent intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital capacity &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum inspiratory pressure less negative than -30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (ie, between -30 and 0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum expiratory pressure &le;40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tidal volume &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span></p><p/><p>Pulmonary function testing is difficult in children who cannot cooperate, typically those younger than six years of age. These patients should be closely monitored and observed for fatigue and other clinical signs of impending respiratory muscle failure. These signs include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sustained increase of pCO<sub>2</sub> to &ge;50 mmHg (normally 35 to 40 mmHg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increasing respiratory rate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing oxygen requirement and increasing alveolar to arterial oxygen difference (normally 5 to 10 mmHg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased use of accessory muscles (eg, sternocleidomastoid use, flaring of the alae nasi, intercostal retractions) and decreased or paradoxical diaphragm movements; these reflect decreased chest wall movement and low lung volumes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating about the head and neck, wide pulse pressure, and bounding pulses; these portend respiratory failure with CO<sub>2</sub> retention</p><p/><p>Children have less metabolic and muscle reserve than adults. They can deteriorate quite rapidly and become apneic or develop alveolar hypoventilation &quot;right under your nose.&quot; Generally, it is wise to have a pediatric critical care specialist involved early in the clinical course.</p><p>Sedation and neuromuscular blockade should be avoided in ventilated patients because they obscure the course of the illness. Providing scrupulous airway care and chest physiotherapy reduces the risk of pneumonia. Tracheostomy may be needed if prolonged ventilation is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autonomic dysfunction is a well-recognized feature of GBS and is a significant source of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Consequently, close monitoring of blood pressure, fluid status, and cardiac rhythm are essential to the management of these patients. Care must also be taken when vasoactive or sedative drugs are used, because GBS-related dysautonomia may exaggerate the hypotensive responses to these drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other supportive measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional needs should be addressed early in the disease course. Orogastric tube feeding, gastrostomy, or parental nutrition is often necessary.</p><p>The patient's position should be changed frequently for comfort and to avoid skin breakdown. Intermittent pressure leg boots are used in the intensive care setting to prevent deep vein thrombosis.</p><p>Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social services should be involved early. Providing the patient with a method of communication is important if normal speech is not possible. Pencil and paper, a &quot;magic slate,&quot; or a communication board can be given to those old enough to write.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89027759\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main modalities of therapy for GBS are intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and plasma exchange (also called plasmapheresis).</p><p>While acknowledging the limitations of data for children, we suggest treatment with IVIG or plasma exchange for children with severe GBS, in general agreement with guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. IVIG is preferred to plasma exchange in children because of the relative safety and ease of administration, although there are no reliable data suggesting that one or the other is superior.</p><p>IVIG and plasma exchange for children with GBS should be reserved for those with any of the following indications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressing weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening respiratory status or need for mechanical ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant bulbar weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to walk unaided</p><p/><p>IVIG and plasma exchange are not recommended for ambulatory children with GBS who have mild, nonprogressive disease or for children whose symptoms have stabilized. Children who have rapid progression followed by stabilization of symptoms within the first or second week of GBS onset may still be considered candidates for treatment by some child neurologists.</p><p>Time to treatment onset may be important in children although data are lacking. In adults, IVIG is recommended by the AAN for patients who are unable to walk unaided if treatment is started within two or possibly four weeks of onset. Similarly, plasma exchange is recommended for adult patients who are unable to walk unaided if treatment is started within four weeks of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids are not beneficial for GBS and have no role in its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reports of the use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) in children with GBS are limited, and no large randomized controlled trials exist. Nevertheless, data from the available small open-label randomized trials in children suggest that IVIG shortens the time to recovery compared with supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Similarly, most observational studies show that IVIG hastens recovery in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. While these trials and studies in children have not proven that IVIG leads to improvement in overall prognosis, their results are consistent with the larger randomized trials showing a beneficial effect of IVIG treatment for GBS in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of improvement with IVIG is uncertain, but it is thought to involve suppression of inflammatory and immune-mediated processes. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy#H158537\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy&quot;, section on 'Suppression of inflammatory/autoimmune processes'</a>.)</p><p>Methodologic differences between reports make it difficult to generalize about when children with GBS begin to improve after IVIG treatment. Nevertheless, muscle strength generally begins to improve in most children within 14 days after initiation of IVIG therapy and most are walking within three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Early transient relapse after IVIG treatment has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19-21</a>].</p><p>The total dose of IVIG for the treatment of GBS in children is 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> given as 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> for two days or 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for five days. This dose is empiric and is based upon treatment of patients with immune deficiency disorders. The dosage schedule is also empiric as little is known of the pharmacokinetics of serum IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most centers give a total of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of IVIG over two days, although one small trial suggested a slightly greater risk of relapse with this regimen as opposed to a five-day course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Typically, patients are given only a single course of IVIG treatment. One study in adults found that a second course of IVIG treatment may benefit patients who have a limited response to the initial course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Variations in treatment response may relate to the wide variation in serum IgG levels achieved after standard doses of IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A study investigating the value of additional doses of IVIG in severe or treatment-refractory adult GBS is now underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In practice many pediatric centers would consider an additional course of IVIG or plasma exchange in severe cases where no recovery is seen within two weeks of presentation, although a prolonged recovery is to be expected in axonal GBS and there is very limited evidence supporting this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Complications and side effects of IVIG treatment are those related to transfusion reactions and are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>IVIG is preferred to plasma exchange in children because of the relative safety and ease of administration, although it has not been shown to have better results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma exchange</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma exchange is recommended for those patients who have rapidly progressing weakness, worsening respiratory status, are unable to walk unaided, require mechanical ventilation, or have significant bulbar weakness. As a result of the cost, risk, and discomfort to the patient, plasma exchange generally is not used for ambulatory patients with mild disease or for patients whose symptoms have stabilized.</p><p>Large, multicenter trials have established the effectiveness of plasma exchange in adult patients with severe GBS. The mechanism is thought to be removal of antibodies directed against nerves from the circulation. Increased muscle strength, earlier improvement, and a lower requirement for mechanical ventilation have been demonstrated, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Plasma exchange'</a>.)</p><p>Experience with plasma exchange in children with GBS is limited. In an updated (2012) meta-analysis of six trials and 649 patients with GBS that included a small number of children who were all &ge;10 years of age, treatment with plasma exchange was superior to supportive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Even patients with mild disease treated with two exchanges had improved outcomes when compared with controls who did not undergo plasma exchange. Plasma exchange was most effective when started within seven days of symptom onset. Compared with supportive care, patients treated with plasma exchange had a slightly higher risk of relapse in the first year after treatment but nevertheless were more likely at one year to have full recovery of muscle strength.</p><p>In general, results of plasma exchange treatment in pediatric patients appear to be similar to those in adults, with a shortened disease course and reduced incidence of respiratory failure. The main benefit seems to be a decrease in the interval from maximum weakness to recovery of independent walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Plasma exchange generally is considered most effective if begun acutely, but may still be beneficial if started within four weeks of initial symptoms. Approximately 10 percent of patients relapse within 10 days after treatment.</p><p>Plasma exchange requires special equipment and trained personnel and can be performed only at centers with expertise in the treatment of children. Because of technical considerations, this procedure is more challenging in children younger than two years of age. The procedure usually consists of four to six double-volume exchanges performed on alternate days over one week. Immunoglobulin levels may be decreased by 30 to 40 percent after plasma exchange.</p><p>The frequency and types of complications from therapeutic apheresis depend on the overall condition of the patient, the number of plasma exchanges, the replacement fluid, and the venous access device. For all therapeutic apheresis, patients may be at risk for citrate-induced hypocalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, or complications related to the vascular catheter. Potential early symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral and distal extremity paresthesias or numbness; severe reactions can include tetany, prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, or hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Younger children most often require placement of a central venous catheter. Potential complications of central venous catheters include infection, pain, nerve damage, thrombosis, perforation, dissecting hematomas, air embolism, or arteriovenous fistulas. Many of these complications can also occur if peripheral veins are used. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961605921\"><span class=\"h2\">IVIG versus plasma exchange</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few comparative trials of plasma exchange and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) in childhood GBS. In a randomized trial from Egypt that enrolled 41 children with very severe GBS necessitating ventilatory support, there was no significant difference between treatment with plasma exchange versus IVIG for length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit or for ability to walk unaided at four weeks after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter for the group treated with plasma exchange (median 11 days, versus 13 days for IVIG).

In most cases, vital capacity and maximum inspiratory pressure should be assessed every four hours at the bedside. All children, particularly those too young to cooperate with pulmonary testing, should be closely monitored and observed for fatigue and other clinical signs of impending respiratory muscle failure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with GBS who have flaccid quadriparesis, rapidly progressive weakness, reduced vital capacity (&le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> bulbar palsy, or autonomic instability should be admitted emergently to a pediatric intensive care unit. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Need for intensive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of children with GBS require mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. Parameters that warn of impending respiratory arrest and are an indication for elective intubation include a vital capacity &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> a maximum inspiratory pressure less negative than -30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (ie, between -30 and 0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O), a maximum expiratory pressure &le;40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, or a tidal volume &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. Clinical signs of impending respiratory muscle failure include a sustained increase of pCO<sub>2</sub> to &ge;50 mmHg, increasing respiratory rate, an increased use of accessory muscles and decreased or paradoxical diaphragm movements, sweating about the head and neck, wide pulse pressure, and bounding pulses. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Need for assisted ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic dysfunction is a well-recognized feature of GBS and is a significant source of mortality. Therefore, management requires continued close monitoring of blood pressure, fluid status, and cardiac rhythm. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) or plasma exchange for children with severe GBS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), as defined by the presence of one or more of the following characteristics (see <a href=\"#H89027759\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progressing weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Worsening respiratory status or need for mechanical ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant bulbar weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inability to walk unaided</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer IVIG to plasma exchange for the treatment of children because of its relative safety and ease of administration, although it has not been shown to have better results. Neither treatment is recommended for ambulatory children with GBS who have mild disease or for children whose symptoms have stabilized. However, children who have rapid progression followed by stabilization of symptoms within the first or second week of GBS onset may still be considered candidates for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H89027759\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data regarding the prognosis of GBS in children are limited, but suggest a mortality rate of 3 to 4 percent, and an excellent long-term recovery (eg, symptom-free or no disability despite residual symptoms) in 90 percent or more of children.
