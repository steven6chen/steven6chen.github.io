As an example, in an analysis from the SOLVD trial, 22 percent of patients had a hematocrit &le;39 percent and 4 percent had values below 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A similar rate of anemia (17 percent) was noted in a population-based cohort of 12,065 patients with newly diagnosed HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Symptoms of anemia such as dyspnea and fatigue may be difficult to distinguish from symptoms of HF.

Since the extraction of oxygen by tissues can increase from 25 to approximately 60 percent with anemia or hypoperfusion, in individuals with normal hemodynamics, normal oxygen delivery is preserved by extraction alone down to a hemoglobin concentration of approximately 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. The hemodynamic effects of chronic anemia were evaluated in a right heart catheterization study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Normal cardiac hemodynamics were maintained in patients with hemoglobin values as low as 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> the cardiac output increased at lower hemoglobin concentrations. </p><p>In healthy individuals, acute, isovolemic reduction in the hemoglobin concentration induces a variety of compensatory changes including increases in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac index along with enhanced tissue oxygen extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The net effect is that oxygen delivery can be maintained at rest at a hemoglobin concentration below 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (equivalent to a hematocrit of 15 percent) if intravascular volume is maintained. </p><p>In patients with HF, oxygen delivery may be impaired due to reduced cardiac output, and thus symptoms may arise at higher hemoglobin levels in patients with anemia and HF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1020861590\"><span class=\"h3\">Development of high-output heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe anemia is a rare cause of high-output HF. High-output HF in the setting of anemia is more likely to occur in the setting of impaired cardiac reserve associated with an underlying cardiac abnormality such as valvular heart disease or left ventricular dysfunction. Only severe degrees of anemia (ie, hemoglobin &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> can produce HF in the absence of underlying heart disease.

Most of these factors are suggested by their association with HF, although causal relationships remain largely unproven. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased circulating cytokines and the anemia of inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation may contribute to the anemia seen in chronic HF. This view is supported by the finding of increased levels of circulating cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in patients with HF, and increased levels of the acute phase reactants C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum ferritin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. Such changes are consistent with those found in patients with the anemia of chronic inflammation, as well as in those with unexplained anemia in the older adult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'The role of cytokines'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-the-older-adult#H11081249\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Inflammation'</a>.)</p><p>While the regulatory peptide hepcidin plays a central role in the anemia of inflammation, its role in the anemia seen in patients with HF is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

The patients with hemodilution appeared to have a worse prognosis.</p><p>In another study in 99 patients with HF, those with anemia had significantly increased plasma volume and no significant reduction in red cell volume, as measured by a chromium-51 assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency may be more common in HF patients than is suggested by iron studies alone since the ferritin level may not correlate with low iron stores. This has been illustrated in series of patients with HF who have been tested simultaneously with bone marrow iron staining and serum iron studies. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2018 series of 42 individuals with HF (mean left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 38 percent, mean age 68 years, 76 percent male), 17 (40 percent) had absent bone marrow iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among those with iron deficiency, serum ferritin levels ranged from 44 to 162 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Serum iron &le;13 plus TSAT &lt;20 had the best diagnostic performance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2006 series of 37 patients with advanced HF (mean LVEF 22 percent; mean New York Heart Association class 3.7) and anemia, there was no stainable bone marrow iron (ie, iron deficiency) in 27 (73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Serum ferritin levels, however, were reduced in only two of the iron deficient patients, indicating that elevated serum ferritin levels do not reliably exclude iron deficiency in this population.</p><p/><p>These studies reinforce the importance of evaluating for iron deficiency in individuals with HF and anemia. (See <a href=\"#H1002593186\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of cause of anemia'</a> above.)</p><p>Whether these results reflect the prevalence of iron deficiency in populations with less severe HF is not known. In addition, the benefit of iron replacement was not assessed in these studies. Additional details of testing and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2672280450\" class=\"local\">'Iron'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which prolong survival in patients with HF, also appear to induce anemia in selected patients. These drugs also reduce the hematocrit following renal transplantation and have been used to treat erythrocytosis in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythrocytosis following renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The impact of ACE inhibitors was evaluated in a report from the SOLVD trial in which patients with left ventricular dysfunction were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At one year after randomization, the rate of new anemia (hematocrit &le;39 percent in men and &le;36 percent in women) was significantly higher in the enalapril group (11.3 versus 7.9 percent with placebo, adjusted odds ratio 1.56). The difference in hematocrit between the two groups was evident as early as six weeks.</p><p>The effect of ACE inhibitors on hematocrit may be mediated by Ac-SDKP (goralatide), a tetrapeptide that inhibits erythropoiesis. Ac-SDKP is metabolized by ACE and would be expected to accumulate in the presence of an ACE inhibitor, thereby inhibiting erythropoiesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal dysfunction and other contributing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When measured, mean serum creatinine levels have been elevated in a number of studies of anemic patients with HF, including those with cardiorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/11,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-25</a>]. Other contributing factors may include poor nutrition due to right-sided HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p>Given the increased age of many of these patients, the possibility of anemia of chronic disease (ACD), unexplained anemia in the elderly (UAE), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myelodysplasia needs to be considered as a cause of the anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-the-older-adult#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with HF, anemia is associated with increased mortality, although it remains uncertain whether anemia is an independent predictor of outcomes or reflects more advanced disease and more extensive comorbidities. </p><p>A number of retrospective studies have evaluated the relationship between anemia and mortality in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/1-3,8,20,26-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,8,20,26-37</a>]. Three studies found a J- or U-shaped relationship between mortality and hemoglobin, with increased mortality associated with hemoglobin levels &lt;13 to 14 or &gt;15 to 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Some studies have suggested that anemia independently predicts worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/1-3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,8</a>]. However, the largest observational study that controlled for the greatest number of possible confounding variables found that anemia was not an independent predictor of outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The independent prognostic significance of anemia in HF patients was suggested in a review of 1061 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) and a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower hemoglobin concentrations were associated with worse hemodynamics, higher blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations, and a lower serum albumin concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lower hemoglobin concentrations (&lt;13.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> had a significantly greater frequency of NYHA class IV HF and lower peak oxygen consumption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On multivariate analysis, a low hemoglobin concentration was an independent predictor of mortality (relative risk 1.13 for each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> fall in hemoglobin concentration).</p><p/><p>Similarly, in an analysis from the SOLVD trial, a low hemoglobin concentration was an independent predictor of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 33 months, each percentage point reduction in hematocrit was associated with a 3 percent increase in mortality. These effects were seen in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> or placebo. As noted above, the incidence of anemia was higher in the enalapril-treated group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>The time course of anemia appears to affect its prognostic significance. In a review of 6159 patients with chronic HF, anemia was present at baseline in 17.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. At six-month follow-up, persistent anemia was associated with higher mortality risk than no anemia (58 versus 31 percent), while transient anemia, which was present in almost one-half of anemic patients, conferred no excess mortality risk.</p><p>These analyses, however, do not establish a causal role for anemia in worse outcomes in HF. Among the possible confounding variables is the possibility that advanced HF exacerbates anemia. If this were the case, anemia would be a marker for advanced disease. Two studies evaluated patients with new onset HF, in whom the anemia would be less likely to be due to the HF. Results from these observational studies were conflicting as to whether anemia is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] or is not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] an independent predictor of outcome. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>In a larger study, anemia was not an independent predictor of outcomes in over 50,000 HF patients &ge;65 years of age who were admitted to the hospital with a principal diagnosis of HF, either new or recurrent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although anemia was a significant predictor of one-year mortality, it was also associated with a wide range of possible confounding factors, including cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities, indices of HF severity, age, gender, and nursing-home residence. In a multivariate analysis incorporating these variables, there was no difference in one-year mortality between patients with a normal hematocrit (40 to 44 percent) and those with severe anemia (hematocrit &le;24 percent). The authors suggested that prior studies were limited by exclusion criteria, small sample size, and, most importantly, failure to incorporate the broad range of possible confounders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Endogenous erythropoietin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The low hemoglobin concentrations seen in patients with HF are associated with elevated plasma erythropoietin concentrations in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. As an example, in one report of 108 patients with HF and 45 controls, plasma erythropoietin increased progressively with NYHA class (from 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL</span> for NYHA class I to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL</span> for NYHA class IV).</p><p>Elevated plasma erythropoietin has been correlated with a lower rate of survival. This was illustrated in a study of 74 patients with HF; approximately one-third each were NYHA class II, III, and IV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Two-year mortality was significantly higher for patients with elevated (&ge;22.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL)</span> plasma erythropoietin (32 versus 16 percent).

Folate deficiency is increasingly rare in individuals who consume a normal diet, due to routine supplementation of flours and grains in many countries. Data on use of transfusions in patients with HF are limited. Erythropoietic agent trials in patients with HF have found no benefit and an increased risk of thromboembolism.

Iron deficiency as diagnosed by ferritin level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transferrin saturation (TSAT) was a criterion in the three randomized trials, although not all patients were anemic, and serum ferritin cutoff values were higher than those generally used in other populations to diagnose iron deficiency. As a result, these studies probably included a mixture of patients, some of whom had anemia that was due, at least in part, to chronic inflammation rather than iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

For the purposes of this study, iron deficiency was defined as a serum ferritin level &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> or a ferritin level of 100 to 299 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> with TSAT &lt;20 percent. Participants were excluded if they had &quot;inflammation,&quot; although this was not defined within the paper. Patients were randomly assigned to receive IV iron (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-carboxymaltose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric carboxymaltose</a>) or placebo at regular intervals during correction and maintenance phases. </p><p>Compared with placebo, IV iron improved self-reported Patient Global assessment and NYHA functional class (28 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. IV iron was also associated with improvement on the disease-specific Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, six-minute walk distance, and health-related quality of life at 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/12,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,55</a>]. These benefits were similar in patients with hemoglobin levels &le;12 or &gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. The rates of death and adverse events were similar in the two groups.</p><p>These results are intriguing and raise several questions. The first is related to the underlying iron status of the study patients. The mean ferritin levels were 52.5 and 60.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-carboxymaltose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric carboxymaltose</a> and placebo groups, respectively. Thus, many patients had ferritin levels well above a cutoff usually considered diagnostic of iron deficiency. However, because of the poor sensitivity of ferritin in this population, many of these individuals may have been iron deficient. Moreover, the combination of a ferritin level &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> and TSAT &lt;20 percent is highly suggestive of the anemia of inflammation rather than absolute iron deficiency, despite the exclusion of subjects with &quot;inflammation.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is also of interest that the clinical benefit of IV iron was not correlated with changes in the patients' hemoglobin levels, suggesting that alternate mechanisms led to the observed improvements. Finally, it is important to note the possibility of inadequate blinding of patients to their treatment group, due to differences in the color of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-carboxymaltose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric carboxymaltose</a> and placebo solutions, particularly in light of the relatively subjective outcome measures used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2888665839\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral iron</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence has demonstrated no benefit from use of oral iron supplements in patients with HF without anemia.
