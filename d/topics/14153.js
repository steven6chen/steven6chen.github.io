Circulating cfDNA is derived from both the mother and the fetal-placenta unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] and cleared from the maternal circulation soon after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although this approach is often called &quot;noninvasive prenatal screening&quot; or &quot;noninvasive prenatal testing,&quot; these terms are nonspecific, as conventional serum screening is also noninvasive.</p><p>The cfDNA test provides excellent performance for women with successful testing (at least 99 percent of Down syndrome pregnancies are detected with a screen positive rate of 1 or 2 per 1000). However, it is still considered a <strong>screening</strong> test due to infrequent false-positive and false-negative results. An invasive procedure (eg, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) and subsequent karyotyping is considered the gold standard <strong>diagnostic</strong> test and is recommended for women who are screen positive by cfDNA testing, particularly those who are considering pregnancy termination.</p><p>This topic will discuss prenatal aneuploidy screening via sequencing of cfDNA in maternal plasma.

The primary source of so-called &quot;fetal&quot; cfDNA in the maternal circulation is thought to be apoptosis of placental cells (syncytiotrophoblast), while maternal hematopoietic cells are the source of most maternal cfDNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. A lessor source is apoptosis of fetal erythroblasts generating cfDNA in the fetal circulation, and these fragments can cross the placenta and enter the maternal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. Since the fetus and the placenta originate from a single fertilized egg, they are usually genetically identical, but differences between the placenta and fetus are important sources of discordant cfDNA test results.</p><p>Circulating cfDNA, whatever its origin, is highly fragmented; each fragment is between 50 and 200 base pairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There is a clear pattern to the fragmentation sizes relating to how the DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. These patterns differ between the maternal and fetal cfDNA, with longer fragments being slightly more likely to be maternally derived. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530559793\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Fetal/placental</span> cfDNA can be isolated from maternal blood as early as five weeks of gestation and almost always by nine weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The relative concentration of fetal cfDNA increases modestly (0.1 percent per week) with gestational age from 10 to approximately 20 weeks, and then increases rapidly (1 percent per week) until term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An adequate amount of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/placental</span> cfDNA must be present to obtain a reliable test result. Four factors can systematically reduce a woman's fetal fraction, which can lead to an assay failure (a report of &quot;no result&quot;) or can result in a false negative result. A low fetal fraction may be due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early gestational age</strong> &ndash; The fetal fraction is substantially lower prior to 10 weeks, so most laboratories require that patients undergo screening at &ge;10 weeks of gestation to ensure an adequate fetal fraction (ie, at least 3 to 4 percent of the total maternal cfDNA) for testing. Fetal cfDNA comprises approximately 13 percent of the total cfDNA in the maternal circulation in the late first and early second trimesters, when prenatal screening is typically performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. It may comprise as much as 50 percent of the total cfDNA in the maternal circulation near term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Suboptimal sample collection</strong> &ndash; Appropriate sample collection and DNA stabilization are important to preserve the fetal fraction, as a small number of degraded white blood cells from the mother's blood will greatly dilute the sample. To solve this problem, the sample should be collected in a standard purple top (EDTA) tube and centrifuged within six hours; the resulting plasma is stable with -80&deg;C freezer storage. Alternatively, a special DNA collection tube (eg, Cell-Free DNA BCT) can be used that stabilizes the sample for up to five days at room temperature; these tubes should not be refrigerated or frozen until processed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An incomplete sample draw (eg, half-filled tubes) may be rejected by the laboratory or may result in a higher likelihood of test failure due to insufficient fetal cfDNA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obesity</strong> &ndash; As maternal weight (and to a lesser extent body mass index) increases, the fetal fraction systematically decreases. This inverse relationship has been attributed to the dilution of a relatively constant amount of fetal cfDNA in the larger maternal plasma volume of obese women and also to an increase in the concentration of maternally-derived cfDNA as maternal weight increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In one study including almost 1500 women with euploid pregnancies, a low fetal fraction (&lt;3.5 percent) was noted in 1.1 percent of all samples but only in 0.2 percent of women &lt;60 kg (132 pounds) versus 10.5 percent of women &gt;110 kg (242 pounds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Others have observed that the risk of low fetal fraction increases for maternal weights as low as 80 kg (180 pounds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The increase in maternally-derived cfDNA in women who are obese may be due to chronic inflammation and cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to serum analyte screening, the laboratory is not able to mathematically adjust the result to correct for maternal weight. (See <a href=\"#H530560245\" class=\"local\">'Implementation issues'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetal karyotype</strong> &ndash; The average fetal fraction at 10 to 20 weeks of gestation is lower in pregnancies with a trisomy 18 fetus (average fetal fraction 9 percent) than pregnancies with a euploid fetus (average fetal fraction 13 percent) or pregnancies with a Down syndrome fetus (average fetal fraction 15 percent). This may partially explain why detection rates for Down syndrome are higher than for trisomy 18, especially when test failures are considered. There are less data for other abnormalities, but it appears that the fetal fraction in both trisomy 13 and Turner syndrome is also lower than in euploid fetuses. Triploid fetuses have extremely low fetal fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticoagulation therapy</strong> &ndash; Maternal use of low molecular weight heparin before 20 weeks of gestation has been associated with lower fetal fractions, resulting in a higher rate of cfDNA test failure (no result) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530559923\"><span class=\"h2\">Clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After delivery, maternal clearance of fetal cfDNA occurs rapidly. In healthy pregnant women, the half-life is approximately one hour, with essentially all fetal cfDNA eliminated within two days of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530559955\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common method of cfDNA screening counts cfDNA fragments for which the chromosome of origin has been identified (aligned). In euploid nonpregnant women, approximately 1.3 percent of cfDNA fragments are derived from the 21 chromosome (the 21<sup>st</sup> chromosome contains about 1.3 percent of the human genome). In pregnancy, the expected percentage of chromosome 21 fragments remains at 1.3 percent if both the fetus and mother are euploid. If the fetus has three chromosome 21s, the proportion of chromosome 21 fragments will be slightly higher, depending on the fetal fraction. For example, if the fetus has Down syndrome and the fetal fraction is 10 percent, the expected proportion of chromosome 21 fragments will be 1.365 percent (1.30 x (1 + [.<span class=\"nowrap\">10/2])</span>. If the fetal fraction is lower, the increment in chromosome 21 fragments is smaller, and it becomes more difficult to detect Down syndrome. If the fetal fraction is high, detection is less difficult.</p><p>In &quot;shotgun sequencing,&quot; random cfDNA fragments are sequenced, which may require up to 10 million mapped fragments to obtain a reliable test result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Alternatively, some laboratories use a preliminary step to enrich for fragments of interest (eg, chromosome 21, 18, 13, X, and Y); this &quot;targeted sequencing&quot; or &quot;chromosome selective sequencing&quot; approach allows the laboratory to map fewer fragments &ndash; approximately one million &ndash; to obtain a reliable test result.</p><p>Another method uses tens of thousands of highly polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located only on chromosomes of interest. Maternal SNP genotypes are inputted and compared with the corresponding genotypes of the mixture of cfDNA from the mother and fetus in the plasma sample. An extra (or missing) chromosome in the plasma results in a shift in the pattern among informative SNPs. According to a commercial laboratory that introduced the SNP genotyping method, interpretations for common aneuploidies can be made for twin pregnancies and the zygosity of each twin can be determined. However, no published study provides the underlying data. Such testing cannot be used in the relatively uncommon instances of egg donor, bone marrow or organ transplant recipient, or a surrogate mother because additional confounding chromosomes (SNPs) are present in the maternal plasma. SNP methods can also identify a vanished dizygotic twin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530559975\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING PERFORMANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening performance is described by the detection rate (DR) and false-positive rate (FPR). It is important to note that a small proportion of cfDNA screening tests fail to provide a result (ie, no result or &quot;no call&quot;); in a meta-analysis of studies of prenatal cfDNA screening, the consensus estimate via random effects modeling was 2 percent (95% CI, 1.4- 2.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, there was significant and unexplained heterogeneity. (See <a href=\"#H453640224\" class=\"local\">'Rates and reasons for cell-free DNA test failures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530559993\"><span class=\"h2\">Trisomy 21, 18, and 13</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cell-free DNA is the most sensitive screening option for these aneuploidies. Performance varies by trisomy and by methodology. Based on multiple meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>], the consensus DRs and FPRs were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trisomy 21 &ndash; DR 99.5 percent, FPR 0.05 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trisomy 18 &ndash; DR 97.7 percent, FPR 0.04 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trisomy 13 &ndash; DR 96.1 percent, FPR 0.06 percent </p><p/><p>These data do not account for test failures in both aneuploid and normal samples, and many of the studies included in these meta-analyses did not have complete follow-up of all pregnancies and could, therefore, overestimate the DR. Test failure rates are important to consider when reporting test performance as higher failure rates may decrease actual DRs, increase false-positive rates, and decrease positive predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The size of this effect depends on the actions taken when the test fails.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530560016\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex chromosome aneuploidies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the largest meta-analysis that evaluated cfDNA test performance for sex chromosome aneuploidies, the DR and FPR for monosomy X (177 cases and 9079 controls) were 90.3 and 0.23 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. For the sex chromosome trisomies 47,XXX; 47,XXY; and 47,XYY (56 cases and 6699 controls), the DR and FPR were 93.0 and 0.14 percent, respectively. Selected method-dependent results have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453640224\"><span class=\"h2\">Rates and reasons for cell-free DNA test failures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of cfDNA failure rates have been reported (0 to 10 percent or more, with a consensus estimate of about 2.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and it is difficult to explain the variability. Although there is no standard approach to this situation, it is common practice to retest using a cfDNA test or to switch to a standard serum screen (eg, combined or quadruple screen) if not already done. A targeted ultrasound is another option, with invasive diagnostic testing as an option if the pregnancy was already considered to be at &quot;high risk.&quot;</p><p>The most common reasons for test failure include less than a specified absolute amount of total <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/placental</span> DNA, fetal fraction below an acceptable level (eg, &lt;4 percent), and insufficient numbers of fragments sequenced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aligned. Low fetal fraction may be responsible for up to 50 percent of all failures, depending on methodology. Another reason for a test failure, depending on the laboratory method used, is long stretches of homozygosity (fragments in which identical gene sequences are discovered originating from the maternally and paternally derived chromosomes). Examples include uniparental disomy (inheritance of both chromosomes from one parent) or parental consanguinity. Even if all quality control parameters are met, some laboratories identify results as &quot;borderline&quot; and will not make a positive or negative screening call. In such instances, a &quot;borderline&quot; test should be considered a screen positive and not a test failure.</p><p>The laboratory's requirements for cfDNA test performance also affect their failure rate and differ among laboratories. Laboratories that prioritize minimizing false-positive and false-negative results may accept a higher rate of failures, whereas laboratories that consider false negatives and false positives to be an inevitable consequence of any screening test may prioritize a low failure rate.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to consider whether the laboratory's reported failure rate includes only total assay failures (eg, the interpretation for trisomy 21 is present, but those for trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 are not); includes only failures related to chromosomes 21, 18, and 13; or includes failures to provide sex chromosome interpretations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530560057\"><span class=\"h2\">Reasons for false-positive and false-negative results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several reasons why the result of a diagnostic test on amniocytes or fetal blood might not agree with the cfDNA test result. It is important to recognize that the cfDNA test result might be analytically correct (eg, correctly defines the genotype of the placenta), while being clinically incorrect (eg, does not correctly define the fetal genotype). Clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">sensitivity/specificity</span> is more important than analytic <span class=\"nowrap\">sensitivity/specificity</span>.</p><p>For the sex chromosomes, the genotype may be accurate, but discordant with the phenotype. This has been attributed to laboratory error, a vanishing twin, and complex disorders of sexual differentiation.&nbsp;Minimal information is available regarding genotype-phenotype discordance following noninvasive prenatal testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530560063\"><span class=\"h3\">False-positive cell-free DNA test results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reasons for false-positive cfDNA (fetus is unaffected, but cfDNA testing indicates chromosomal abnormality) include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confined placental mosaicism</strong> &ndash; Since the primary source of &quot;fetal&quot; cfDNA in the maternal circulation is placental cells (syncytiotrophoblast), the cfDNA test will provide results relevant to the placenta, which may be discordant with fetal tissue. In these cases, the cfDNA test is analytically correct but clinically incorrect. Experience gained from chorionic villus sampling indicates that this may occur in up to 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>].

This is because the placenta from the demised twin (which is also likely to be aneuploid) is still present at the time of testing and continues to shed DNA weeks after the fetal demise. This occurrence of a twin rather than a singleton pregnancy may not have been recognized if the demise occurred very early in gestation, hence the term &quot;vanishing twin.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maternal mosaicism</strong> &ndash; Most cfDNA testing methods assume that the mother has a normal karyotype, but this is not always true. For example, with increasing age, an increasing proportion of women have a small percentage of cells that have lost an X chromosome, and these can lead to a false-positive cfDNA result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In such phenotypically normal women, the lower X chromosome signal on cfDNA testing would be attributed to the fetus and reported as fetal Turner syndrome.

In a pregnant woman with a tumor, cell-free fetal and maternal DNA as well as circulating tumor DNA contribute to total cfDNA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fewer than half of cfDNA commercial tests are able to identify a pattern suggestive of maternal cancer. In one study of 450,000 tested pregnancies, 55 potential cases of maternal cancer were identified: 40 of these were confirmed to be maternal neoplasms, 20 were benign uterine fibroids, 18 were malignant neoplasms (7 of which were already known), and 2 were unclassified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thus, among 450,000 tests, 11 new malignant maternal neoplasms were identified (1 in 41,000). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Programs that offer cfDNA testing that could identify maternal cancer should have referral plans in place to deal with these rare abnormal reports. The appropriate clinical evaluation of such patients is unclear at this time. Various approaches have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], but remain unvalidated. The most common malignancies in reproductive ages women are breast, cervix, ovary, colorectal, leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer, and melanoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Educational materials and counseling of women considering cfDNA for fetal aneuploidy screening should include the possibility that cancer may be identified in the mother. However, cfDNA testing should not be considered a screening test for maternal malignancy, given the paucity of data on this association, the potential for false-positive results, and the emotional and medical impact of such results on the patient's well-being. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maternal copy number variants</strong> &ndash; The methodology for cfDNA analysis assumes that every woman carries the same proportion of genetic material on a given chromosome, but chromosomes vary slightly among individuals due to inherited or de novo copy number variants (ie, deletion or duplication of a genomic region[s]). In these individuals, cfDNA sequencing might yield a positive result when the size of the maternal duplication was relatively large and it occurred on a chromosome of interest (eg, chromosome 21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In two studies, maternal duplications on chromosome 18 were the likely cause of trisomy 18 false-positive results in six of seven cases examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Deeper sequencing (eg, higher number of fragments sequenced) makes this form of false-positive results more likely. Shotgun methods are less likely to be influenced by copy number variants on one chromosome as all autosomes are used to normalize counts from the chromosome of interest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chance &ndash; </strong>False-positive results can also be the result of statistical chance, as the cut-off for a positive test is often set at +3 standard deviations. Therefore, 1 or 2 per 1000 euploid fetuses might have a false-positive result by chance alone, and if 100,000 tests were performed, an estimated 100 false-positive results would be expected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technical issues &ndash; </strong>As with all laboratory testing, rare sample mix-ups or other technical errors could lead to false-positive (or false-negative) test results.

It is possible that a fetus could be aneuploid even though the karyotype of the placenta does not reflect that finding. In these cases, the cfDNA test is analytically correct (ie, detecting those placental cells of the mosaicism which are euploid) but clinically incorrect (ie, the fetus itself is aneuploid). This is recognized to occur for trisomy 13 and 18 but not trisomy 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling#H368306502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;, section on 'Confined placental mosaicism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Borderline low fetal fraction &ndash; </strong>A low but adequate fetal fraction (eg, between 3 and 5 percent) results in a very small difference in the expected (normal reference) versus observed percentage of chromosome fragments (eg, chromosome 21 fragments). If a sufficient number of fragments are not sequenced, this difference will not be identified and the results will be incorrectly reported as screen-negative. (See <a href=\"#H530559955\" class=\"local\">'Methodology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H530559793\" class=\"local\">'Fetal fraction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maternal copy number variants</strong> &ndash; As described above, maternal duplications can cause a false-positive result. It is also theoretically possible for a maternal deletion to cause a false-negative result. However, this would be a much rarer event, as the fetus must be aneuploid and the maternal deletion would need to be on the same chromosome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technical issues </strong>&ndash; Technical assay issues can make the identification of some aneuploidies more difficult. For example, the low guanine-cytosine content of chromosome 13 renders the polymerase chain reaction steps and subsequent sequencing counts less reliable. This results in lower DRs than for other aneuploidies. Laboratories attempt to correct for this in the bioinformatics analysis, but are not always successful. There are also occasional sample mix-ups or other laboratory-related issues that could cause a false-negative test result.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16189037\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictive value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DR and FPR for aneuploidy with cfDNA screening are unlikely to differ in low-risk (general population) or high-risk settings. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) will depend on the prevalence of each specific aneuploidy in the population. The table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F104055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104055 \">table 1</a>) shows both PPV and NPV in a general population (low-risk) setting and a high-risk setting (eg, women &ge;35 years of age). Some tests may have higher (or lower) predictive values (due to small differences in estimates of DR and FPR), and this table is designed only to demonstrate expected average differences. First, all NPVs are quite high: &ge;99.9 percent. This is mainly due to the low a priori prevalence of these disorders. The first two rows show the difference between combined serum <span class=\"nowrap\">analyte/ultrasound-based</span> screening and that based on cfDNA. The PPVs are higher for cfDNA compared with combined testing, and the PPVs are also higher in the higher-risk setting. The DR, FPR and PPV are all population statistics and are most useful for clinicians and patients when deciding on whether to test, or which test to choose. After testing is completed, optimal laboratory practice would be to report a patient-specific risk base on both prior test risk (eg, age, abnormal ultrasound, prior history, screen-positive serum test) and the cfDNA test. However, most laboratories choose to report the average risk in screen-positive women (the PPV), after accounting only for the woman's age.</p><p>Since trisomy 18 is less common (even in the high-risk setting), the PPVs are lower, but are still much higher than those for Down syndrome using the combined test. Lastly, Turner syndrome (45X) is not associated with maternal age, and therefore the PPVs are expected to be the same in both the general pregnancy population and women age 35 and older at delivery. However, specific ultrasound findings such as increased nuchal translucency measurement is associated with a much higher risk of Turner syndrome. A confounding factor is the increasing prevalence of 45X cells in women as they age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All of the observed PPVs are considerably lower than the individual risks reported by some laboratories (eg, &gt;99:1 or 99 percent), even though this high individual risk is reported for nearly all positive calls. This discrepancy between the reported individual risks and reasonable PPVs may be the reason for the initial &quot;surprise&quot; at the presence of false-positive results, especially among trisomy 18 positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p>Commercial marketing of cfDNA screening for aneuploidy has not emphasized the difference between sensitivity and PPV. Patients should understand that if they receive a positive result for Down syndrome, the likelihood that the fetus actually has Down syndrome is less than 99 percent (ie, the PPV is less than the sensitivity) and possibly much less. Likewise, women who receive a negative result should understand that the likelihood that the fetus does not have Down syndrome (NPV) is high but also depends on multiple factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530560198\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who choose to be screened for Down syndrome by cfDNA will almost always also receive screening for trisomy 18 and trisomy 13, which are less common. They may also choose to be screened for sex chromosome aneuploidies or these may be included in the baseline set of conditions included in the screen. As discussed above, detection rates (DRs) for these aneuploidies are lower than for Down syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H530559993\" class=\"local\">'Trisomy 21, 18, and 13'</a> above and <a href=\"#H530560016\" class=\"local\">'Sex chromosome aneuploidies'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530560204\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>cfDNA is commonly used as a secondary Down syndrome screening test. It may also be used as a secondary screening test for trisomy 18 and trisomy 13.</p><p>By definition, secondary screening is a follow-up, nondiagnostic test offered to a population that has already been found to be screen-positive (high-risk) as a result of a previous screening test. For Down syndrome, these preliminary screening tests can include maternal age &ge;35 years at delivery, abnormal ultrasound findings indicating increased risk (eg, increased nuchal translucency), an abnormal serum screening test (eg, first trimester combined testing), a positive family history of aneuploidy (eg, previous aneuploid pregnancy), or a parent who carries a relevant Robertsonian translocation (eg, balanced translocation with risk for trisomy 13 or 21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The purpose of secondary screening in this setting is to take advantage of the high sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA screening. High specificity allows for a large reduction in the number of unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures in initially screen positive women who have a negative cfDNA testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103823\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103823 \">algorithm 1</a>). The high sensitivity of cfDNA testing helps ensure that the few women with an affected pregnancy that were initially screen positive will be correctly classified as high risk. Since the majority of women who undergo cfDNA screening prior to amniocentesis will receive a low-risk result and thus might want to avoid an invasive procedure, the high cost of the cfDNA screening test (USD $800 to $3000) may be justified by savings from averted diagnostic testing (amniocentesis and karyotype). Although cfDNA screening fails to give usable results for some women (1 to 5 percent), women with test failures who are already classified as being at high risk can still be offered diagnostic testing.</p><p>There are two models that utilize serum and cfDNA screening in the general pregnancy population. The aims are to increase detection, reduce false-positive rates, and keep costs relatively constant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1638915841\"><span class=\"h3\">Contingent model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], all women from a general pregnancy population are offered first-trimester combined screening with two risk cut-offs. The &quot;high risk&quot; (eg, &gt;1:150) identifies a group that could choose between going directly to invasive testing or to secondary cfDNA screening (or no further testing). About 3 to 5 percent of women would have a &quot;high risk&rdquo; result. The low-risk group (eg, &lt;1:1000) would receive routine prenatal care with no options for further testing. About 80 to 85 percent of women having the combined test would be low risk. The newly defined intermediate-risk group (eg, 1:151 to 1:1000) represents about 10 to 15 percent of the screened population. These women are informed of their intermediate risk and offered cfDNA screening after counseling. If the cfDNA test is positive for women in the high or intermediate risk group, those women would also be offered invasive testing. </p><p>An important feature of contingent screening is that the women receiving an intermediate-risk report must return for counseling and the offer of further testing. This contingent screening has the potential to increase detection because 10 to 15 percent of the population is offered secondary screening. However, the use of cfDNA as the secondary test results in very few &quot;false-positive&quot; findings (0.1 to 0.2 percent) that result in an unnecessary invasive test. The actual detection and false-positive rates for a contingent model are dependent on the proportion of women (and their risks) in the intermediate group that agree to further testing. It also requires additional resources to meet with and counsel these women while collecting the second sample.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2009478307\"><span class=\"h3\">Reflexive model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] utilizes the same risk cut-off levels described above for contingent screening but collects a plasma sample suitable for cfDNA testing at the time the serum is collected. The &quot;high-risk&quot; women are offered cfDNA or invasive testing and the low-risk women receive routine care. However, the intermediate-risk women automatically (reflexively) have the plasma sample tested and the result returned, negating the need for a call-back or counseling session. This saves time and resources and provided a predictable increase in detection. However, there is an additional expense added by the upfront collection of plasma samples in 100 percent of the women when only 10 to 12 percent will have that sample reflexively tested.</p><p>Overall, the detection and false-positive rates are more predictable for the reflexive model than the contingent model. In the contingent model, women with an intermediate risk result will need to return for a sample draw and cfDNA testing, and not all will choose to do so. In the reflexive model, a sample is already available for cfDNA testing for all women in the intermediate risk group. In the reflexive model, it is important that women understand and consent to the possibility of the two tests and that the resulting individual risk may be quite high (similar to having cfDNA as a primary screen in the high-risk population). </p><p>Combined screening alone results in a detection and false positive rate of about 85 and 5 percent, respectively. Both the contingent and reflexive models will increase detection (by defining a new intermediate risk group) and reduce the false positive rate as the highly specific cfDNA is the secondary screen. In a report summarizing the results of a reflexive model implementation in over 22,000 women, the Down syndrome detection rate was 95 percent (69 of 73) at a false positive rate of 0.02percent (4 of 22,706) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The detection rate for the contingent model will be slightly lower, as not all women with intermediate risks will chose secondary screening via cfDNA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530560227\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary screening, by definition, is the first screening test for a given disorder or set of disorders. The use of cfDNA as a primary screening test in the United States is limited by some practical concerns.</p><p>Although cfDNA screening has a higher DR for Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13 than serum analyte screening and a lower false-positive rate (FPR), some professional organizations are cautious about offering cfDNA screening to the general population as a primary screening test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. </p><p>There are several reasons for the lack of universal endorsement for primary cfDNA screening in low-risk women, but important considerations are the higher cost of the test compared with serum immunoassays, concerns about the availability of appropriate pretest counseling, and concerns that some women terminate after a positive screen without diagnostic testing even though the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test is lower in younger women (eg, PPV trisomy 21 at age 20 = 48 percent versus 93 percent at age 40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In addition, there is a lack of consensus regarding the appropriate follow-up procedures for women in the general population who have a cfDNA test failure (usually between 1 and 5 percent). Importantly, sufficient expertise and resources are not available in the United States to provide formal genetic counseling for any prenatal screening test in all low-risk women. Although further study is needed to determine whether primary care practices can provide adequate counseling to allow for informed choice, at least one study in the United States-reported that patient education about cfDNA screening can be conducted successfully through general obstetric providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] (See <a href=\"#H530560245\" class=\"local\">'Implementation issues'</a> below.)</p><p>Screening for the most common sex chromosome aneuploidies is controversial because these individuals have fewer serious physical abnormalities than those with trisomy 21, 18, or 13, and the phenotypic features are much more variable. One rationale for screening is that in the absence of prenatal or early childhood screening, these disorders are often diagnosed later in life, after some options for treatment, such as for 47,XXY, have passed.

The key pre-test points to discuss with patients who are considering cfDNA screening include: screening is optional, the difference between screening tests and diagnostic tests, basic principles of cfDNA technology, conditions that may be detected by screening and their clinical features and variability, reporting format, test performance (eg, sensitivity, false positive rate, false negative rate, test failure rate), limitations of the test, incidental findings, timing, and need to confirm abnormal screening results before considering termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Screening is optional</strong> &ndash; The decision to undergo screening depends on how each woman balances the benefits of obtaining information about aneuploidy with the potential emotional and physical risks of testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limitations of screening versus diagnostic testing</strong> &ndash; Women need to understand the difference between a screening test, which classifies women as at higher or lower risk of specific fetal aneuploidies, and a diagnostic test, which can diagnose or eliminate the chance that a fetus has any chromosome abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sequencing cfDNA is a screening test; it has false positive and negative results and does not test for all genetic syndromes or all aneuploidies: it tests for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidy. Diagnostic procedures such as amniocentesis obtain fetal cells and subsequent testing by karyotyping or microarray can diagnose all aneuploidies; can distinguish between full trisomy and trisomy caused by an unbalanced chromosomal rearrangement; and can detect mosaicism and <span class=\"nowrap\">microdeletions/microduplications</span> (microarray), and open neural tube defects. If there are one or more structural anomalies on ultrasound examination, a microarray on amniocytes is the preferred test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Even in the absence of structural anomalies or soft markers on ultrasound, women who want to maximize the amount of genetic information they can obtain about their fetus should consider an invasive diagnostic test (amniocentesis, CVS) with chromosomal microarray analysis.

Conventional serum analyte screening for aneuploidy can lead to the serendipitous identification of chromosome abnormalities not targeted by the screening test. Prior to the widespread use of cfDNA as a secondary screening test, serum screen-positive women generally chose an invasive procedure for conventional karyotype or microarray. However, many of the additional abnormalities identified are rare, with some having a very low chance of survival (eg, triploidy), while others were not phenotypically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cost</strong> &ndash; Women need to know whether their insurance covers the cfDNA screening costs completely, and if not, what charges will be their responsibility (eg, copayment, deductible). This is a time-consuming process that may require preauthorization steps that still do not provide a firm answer to the question. More and more insurance policies are covering the costs of cfDNA testing for women with a high-risk pregnancy. Some insurance policies are covering cfDNA screening for all pregnant women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Turnaround time</strong> &ndash; Overall turnaround time is as little as five to seven days from sample collection to receipt of final report.

Individual clinicians, practices, and patients are targets for aggressive tactics to obtain market share. A systematic review concluded these companies' internet sites often do not provide supporting evidence for the information cited and may not provide adequate information about the need for an invasive test to definitely diagnose aneuploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Choice of laboratory</strong> &ndash; It is not possible to confidently conclude that any one laboratory has a superior combination of DR, FPR, and failure rates than another. It is most likely that decisions regarding choice of laboratory will be based on other factors such as ease of ordering and receiving results, charges, turn-around-time, special circumstances (eg, known twins), results reporting, and service. This latter item is crucial, as some report results are cryptic and the availability of knowledgeable support personnel is invaluable in providing easy-to-understand results to patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory report</strong> &ndash; Given that all tests are laboratory-developed, there is little consistency among laboratories in reporting negative or positive results or reporting test failures. Some laboratories report a risk based mainly on maternal age and cfDNA test results; others provide categorical results (consistent with extra chromosome 21 material). In some instances, the risks reported for positive cfDNA test are unreasonably high (eg &gt;99 to 1), even though the laboratory has data that the PPV is far lower. None are able to incorporate the a priori risk, even though an elevated <em>a priori</em> risk is the main reason for testing at this time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392859375\"><span class=\"h3\">Twins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of cfDNA for screening twin pregnancies is not yet endorsed by ACOG, ACMG, or other professional societies. The amount of cfDNA for the pregnancy overall is about 35 percent higher in twin pregnancies than singleton pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In turn, the amount of cfDNA contributed by each twin is lower than in a singleton pregnancy and may be quite different for the two fetuses in dizygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. One approach, therefore, is to modify the algorithm used for singleton pregnancies to estimate the smallest fetal fraction contribution of the two fetuses, which involves identifying nonpolymorphic and polymorphic loci where fetal alleles differ from maternal alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. However, this type of analysis is not performed by the majority of laboratories providing cfDNA testing. Because it is impossible to determine which twin is abnormal based on cfDNA analysis alone, results are reported for the entire pregnancy, and invasive testing is required to distinguish which twin, if either one, is affected. Some laboratories that offer cfDNA screening in twin pregnancies use methods that are &quot;blind&quot; to the number of fetuses. </p><p>Based on preliminary data from 758 twin pregnancies with known outcomes, the detection rates for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 were 95 <span class=\"nowrap\">(37/39),</span> 85 <span class=\"nowrap\">(6/7),</span> and 100 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(2/2),</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. An important ancillary finding was a higher test failure rate, especially if the methodology was able to determine the fetal-specific fetal fraction and the lower of the two was used for inclusion. One methodology using single nucleotide polymorphisms can identify dizygotic twins but cannot provide an interpretation. This may be seen as a disadvantage, but such a test can also identify a vanished twin in the same way, which may have clinical advantages.</p><p>Based on two meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>], the consensus DR and FPR for trisomy 21 in twin pregnancies were 98.7 and 0.11 percent, respectively.

Fetal cfDNA is still produced, but the fetal fraction in maternal blood is reduced because of an increased contribution of maternal cfDNA from apoptosis of adipose tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dilution of fetal (placental) DNA in the larger maternal blood volume. Women weighing over 180 pounds (81 kg) can be informed that their chance of having a test failure or an inaccurate result is at least three or four times higher than in women of lower weight (3.3 versus 0.5 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]), and the chance of a false-negative result is also slightly higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/14,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,75</a>]. Serum screening may be offered to women with significant obesity as an alternative to cfDNA. If the no call result is obtained late in the pregnancy and the woman is high-risk, offering diagnostic testing rather than any screening test may be an option.

There is some controversy about whether an early gestation cfDNA positive screen should be confirmed by chorionic villus sampling or postponed until &ge;15 weeks when amniocentesis can be performed, as analysis of amniocytes is more definitive since it is representative of the fetal genotype rather than the analysis of placental cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. For disorders where definitive diagnosis will not affect continuation of pregnancy or pregnancy management (eg, sex aneuploidy), the parental choice to delay diagnostic testing until after delivery, or even later, is also reasonable. </p><p>A conventional G-banded karyotype (not FISH or microarray) is critical to obtain in cfDNA screen positive cases. FISH and microarray can identify additional copies of aneuploid segments but not their orientation to the other chromosomes. In 5 to 10 percent of pregnancies with a common aneuploidy, one of the parents will be identified with a balanced translocation and this information will alter their reproductive counseling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4202571382\"><span class=\"h2\">Screen-negative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A screen-negative result means the fetus is at a reduced risk of having one of the aneuploidies in the test panel, but does not eliminate the possibility of an affected fetus or the possibility of a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality not targeted by the screening test but detectable with diagnostic testing. Screen-negative women are not usually offered invasive diagnostic testing.</p><p>However, screen-negative women who go on to develop an indication for invasive diagnostic testing, such as a fetal anatomic anomaly on ultrasound examination, should be offered this testing. This recommendation does not apply to the fetus found to have an isolated soft marker.

Offering invasive diagnostic testing is appropriate, especially if the pregnancy with a failed test was already at high risk for aneuploidy prior to cfDNA testing (eg, advanced maternal age, abnormal ultrasound). However, one study found that the risk for aneuploidy is relegated to that group with very low fetal fractions (eg, &lt;2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When reviewing this literature, it is important to ensure that the testing was equivalent to that found in clinical practice. For example, the proportion of aneuploid pregnancies among initial test failures may not be representative of that found after the repeat testing protocol is used, as is often the practice.</p><p>If the pregnancy did not have prior risk factors for aneuploidy, standard <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/ultrasound</span> screening is an option, with invasive diagnostic testing if that screen is positive. However, patients should understand that standard <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/ultrasound</span> screening is a less sensitive test than cfDNA screening and typically screens for trisomy 21 and 18, not trisomy 13 or sex chromosome aneuploidy.

All methodologies are better able to identify those syndromes where the <span class=\"nowrap\">deletion/duplication</span> is relatively large (ie, at least three to five megabases). Since these syndromes are uncommon, laboratories using shotgun sequencing can maintain a high predictive value by limiting the false-positive rate (FPR, 1-specificity); however, this also limits the detection rate (DR). Other laboratories have targeted microdeletion panels that are intended to have higher DRs; the higher FPR may be managed by reflexively testing the few positive samples more thoroughly (ie, more fragments sequenced) for confirmation prior to the release of results. The table shows microdeletion and microduplication disorder screening offered by two laboratories, as well as screening offered for two rare aneuploidies (trisomy 16 and 22) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103827 \">table 2</a>).

In some cases, the targeted syndrome was chosen because of the large size of the microdeletion, rather than its clinical relevance.</p><p>All professional societies recommend against offering <span class=\"nowrap\">microdeletion/microduplication</span> syndrome testing as part of routine screening<em>.</em> Given the difficulty in follow-up, small numbers of cases detected, variable penetrance, uncertainty in the underlying prevalence, and lack of validation based on real samples, it is not possible to provide reliable estimates of DRs, FPRs, or positive predictive values. Although the American College of Medical Genetics states that women should be informed about cfDNA screening for certain copy number variants (CNVs), such as deletions of <em>22q11.2 </em>(DiGeorge syndrome)<em>, 1p36</em>, and <em>15q11.2-13 </em>(Angelman or Prader-Willi syndrome)<em>, </em>they recommend against this screening for genome-wide detection of CNVs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Circulating cfDNA is derived from both the mother and the fetus, although most &quot;fetal&quot; DNA is derived from the placenta and cleared from the maternal circulation soon after delivery. (See <a href=\"#H530559703\" class=\"local\">'Origins'</a> above and <a href=\"#H530559923\" class=\"local\">'Clearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal plasma must contain an adequate amount of fetal cfDNA to obtain a reliable test result. Four factors can reduce the fetal fraction, which can lead to an assay failure (a report of &quot;no result&quot;). A low fetal fraction can be due to screening before 10 weeks of gestation, suboptimal sample collection or processing, maternal obesity, or select disorders (eg, trisomy 18, Turner syndrome, triploidy). (See <a href=\"#H530559793\" class=\"local\">'Fetal fraction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell-free DNA is the most sensitive screening option for detecting trisomy 21, 18, and 13. Performance varies by trisomy and by methodology. Based on multiple meta-analyses, the consensus DRs and FPRs are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trisomy 21 &ndash; DR 99.5 percent, FPR 0.05 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trisomy 18 &ndash; DR 97.7 percent, FPR 0.04 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trisomy 13 &ndash; DR 96.1 percent, FPR 0.06 percent </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, these data do not account for test failures. (See <a href=\"#H530559993\" class=\"local\">'Trisomy 21, 18, and 13'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest meta-analysis that evaluated cfDNA test performance for sex chromosome aneuploidies, the DR and FPR for monosomy X (177 cases and 9079 controls) were 90.3 and 0.23 percent, respectively. For the sex chromosome trisomies 47,XXX; 47,XXY; and 47,XYY (56 cases and 6699 controls), the DR and FPR were 93.0 and 0.14 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H530560016\" class=\"local\">'Sex chromosome aneuploidies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wide range of cfDNA failure rates have been reported. Although there is no standard approach to this situation, it is common practice to retest using a cfDNA test or to switch to a standard serum biochemical marker screen, if not already done. A targeted ultrasound is another option, with invasive diagnostic testing as an option if the pregnancy was already considered to be at &quot;high risk.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common reasons for test failure include less than a specified absolute amount of total <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/placental</span> DNA, fetal fraction below an acceptable level (eg, &lt;4 percent), and insufficient numbers of fragments sequenced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aligned. The laboratory's requirements for cfDNA test performance also affect their failure rate and differ among laboratories. It is important to consider whether the laboratory's reported failure rate includes only total assay failures; includes only failures related to chromosomes 21, 18, and 13; or includes failures to provide sex chromosome interpretations. (See <a href=\"#H453640224\" class=\"local\">'Rates and reasons for cell-free DNA test failures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False-positive tests may be due to confined placental mosaicism, demised twin, maternal mosaicism, maternal cancer, maternal copy number variants, technical issues, or chance. (See <a href=\"#H530560063\" class=\"local\">'False-positive cell-free DNA test results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False-negative tests may be due to confined placental mosaicism, borderline low fetal fraction, maternal copy number variants, and technical issues.

Women ages 35 and older with a screen-positive result for Down syndrome and trisomy 18 have risks on the order of 87 percent (odds 7:1) and 63 percent (odds 1:1), respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F104055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104055 \">table 1</a>). Likewise, women who receive a negative result should understand that the likelihood that the fetus does not have Down syndrome (negative predictive value) is high but also depends on multiple factors. (See <a href=\"#H16189037\" class=\"local\">'Predictive value'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>cfDNA is commonly used as a secondary screening test in women found to be screen-positive (high-risk) as a result of a previous screening test: maternal age &ge;35 years at delivery, abnormal ultrasound findings indicating increased risk (eg, increased nuchal translucency), an abnormal serum screening test, a positive family history of aneuploidy, or a parent who carries a relevant Robertsonian translocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103823\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103823 \">algorithm 1</a>). The majority of women who undergo cfDNA secondary screening will receive a low-risk result and thus will avoid an invasive procedure. The high sensitivity of the test helps to ensure that very few women with an affected pregnancy will be incorrectly reclassified as being at low risk. (See <a href=\"#H530560204\" class=\"local\">'Secondary screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>cfDNA screening is increasingly being offered as a primary screening test for fetal aneuploidy in the United States.

Screening using cfDNA is targeted at detecting trisomy 21, 18, or 13 and sex aneuploidies and is not diagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H3563739191\" class=\"local\">'Patient education and counseling'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women weighing over 180 pounds (81 kg) can be informed that their chance of having a test failure is three or four times higher than in women of lower weight and that even if the test is successful, the chance of a false-negative result is also higher as well. For women in this weight range at an advanced gestational age, at high-risk of fetal aneuploidy, and with body habitus limitations on obtaining a complete fetal survey, offering diagnostic testing may be a viable option. (See <a href=\"#H914439392\" class=\"local\">'Obese women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of cfDNA screening in twin pregnancies is controversial because of limited data on test performance.
