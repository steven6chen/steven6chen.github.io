Some rare mutations in these globin chains change the affinity of the hemoglobin molecule for oxygen, thereby disturbing the normal loading of oxygen in the lungs and delivery of oxygen to the tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mutations in the coding sequence of globin genes that alter hemoglobin oxygen affinity and mutations in other genes that may cause erythrocytosis (polycythemia) will be discussed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Understanding these hemoglobin mutants is useful for clinicians who must diagnose and treat patients with suspected hemoglobinopathies.</p><p>The more general evaluation of patients with erythrocytosis, which may be a consequence of other disorders that increase the production of RBCs such as polycythemia vera or smoking, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-polycythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with polycythemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal oxygen binding characteristics of hemoglobin are displayed by the sigmoidally-shaped hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve and its P50, the point on the curve where the hemoglobin molecule is half-saturated with oxygen.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is high (ie, low P50), oxygen delivery to tissues is impaired, stimulating erythropoietin production and increasing the red cell mass, resulting in erythrocytosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, in patients with hemoglobins having a low oxygen affinity (ie, high P50), oxygen delivery to the tissues is increased, often resulting in anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cyanosis.</p><p/><p>The hemoglobin-oxygen association-dissociation curve has two main characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cooperativity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The shape of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve is due to a phenomenon seen in some proteins known as cooperativity. This means that partial saturation of hemoglobin heme groups with oxygen increases the affinity of the remaining heme groups for oxygen. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the T (tense [deoxygenated]) form of hemoglobin has a lower affinity for ligands such as oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) than the R (relaxed [oxygenated]) form.</p><p>The totally deoxygenated hemoglobin tetramer is in the T conformation; it is slow to bind the first oxygen molecule (each globin chain heme can bind one oxygen molecule), but the reaction with oxygen accelerates as oxygenation proceeds. At some point during the sequential addition of oxygen to the four hemes of the molecule, a transition from the T to the R conformation occurs. At this point, the oxygen affinity of the partially liganded molecule increases markedly, producing a sigmoidal curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>N values, an expression of cooperativity, refer to the degree of sigmoidicity or steepness of the middle of the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin, and underlies the cross-talk between hemes. This sigmoidal curve and the cooperativity of the normal hemoglobin tetramer graphically display the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen in the high oxygen environment of the lungs and deliver it to tissues where oxygen content is lower.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifiers of oxygen affinity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen affinity, displayed by the shape and position of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve is modified by temperature, pH, the chemical binding of compounds such as hydrogen ion, and by the major modulator of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity in human erythrocytes, 2,3- bisphosphoglycerate (2,3 BPG).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH OXYGEN AFFINITY HEMOGLOBINS: ERYTHROCYTOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the primary structure of the alpha- or beta-globin chains can change hemoglobin-ligand affinity and be clinically significant; the clinical significance of mutations in other normal globin genes, the fetal gamma- and adult delta-globin gene are likely to be nil and have not been described. Single amino acid substitutions, substitutions of two amino acids, deletions and insertions of amino acids, reading frameshift mutations, and fusion genes can all result in hemoglobins with increased oxygen affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most, but not all, of these high affinity hemoglobins, as noted below, can be understood with our present knowledge of the structure-function relationships in hemoglobin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Underlying all known high ligand affinity hemoglobin mutants is the furtherance of the R state, or high affinity conformer of the hemoglobin molecule. This can occur by stabilizing the R state or destabilizing the T state (low affinity conformer). The molecular basis of this change can be:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alteration in areas of the molecule directly involved in the R&mdash;&gt;T transition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A change of the alpha1beta1 interface, which is not normally dissociable and does not participate in the R&mdash;&gt;T conformational change</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mutation reducing the affinity of the hemoglobin for 2,3-BPG</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heme pocket mutations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elongation of chains by termination codon or a frame-shift mutation.</p><p/><p>High oxygen affinity variants illustrating some of these mechanisms are discussed below. A listing of the known high and low oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants affecting the alpha- and beta-globin genes can be found on the Globin Gene Server (<a href=\"http://globin.cse.psu.edu/&amp;token=W/MNZorEFI2EtNnE4Oqza+LSzyNbNNPsEL85T2QwNbbfeKuzf3vos5FVncGUXy64&amp;TOPIC_ID=7164\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://globin.cse.psu.edu</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The beta globin gene is affected in a majority of the high affinity variants (79 of 100) and the low affinity variants (38 of 49).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Alterations affecting the R&mdash;&gt;T transition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in critical molecular regions involved in the R&mdash;&gt;T state transition may result in R state stabilization or T state destabilization, either of which increase oxygen affinity. Other mutations affecting this transition can produce low oxygen affinity hemoglobins (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hb Chesapeake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hb Chesapeake (HBA arg92leu), found in an 81-year-old patient with erythrocytosis, was the first high affinity mutant described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fifteen members of the proband's family were similarly affected. The mutation is in the alpha-globin chain and produces mild erythrocytosis, as high affinity alpha chain mutants typically make up only 20 to 25 percent of the total hemoglobin compared with 40 to 50 percent for beta-globin variants. The concentration of stable alpha-globin variants is usually about half that of beta-globin variants. This is because there are four alpha-globin genes, each contributing roughly 25 percent of the total amount of alpha globin, while each of the two beta-globin genes contribute about 50 percent of the beta globin.</p><p>Using alkaline hemoglobin electrophoresis, Hb Chesapeake is a fast-moving electrophoretic variant, representing about 20 percent of the hemolysate. Oxygen affinity studies revealed a whole blood p50 of 19 mmHg (normal: 26 mmHg) with a normal Bohr effect (increase in oxygen affinity with elevations in pH) and normal 2,3-BPG binding. Alpha 92leu involves a substitution of an invariant residue &mdash; a residue conserved among most alpha-globin chains analyzed regardless of species &mdash; that stabilizes the R state at the alpha1beta2 area of contact, making T conformer contacts less favored.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hb Montefiore</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hb Montefiore (HBA asp126tyr) produces a mild erythrocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This hemoglobin variant migrates close to HbF (at pH 8.6) and accounts for 20.3 percent of the hemolysate, explaining the mild phenotype. Two other high affinity variants, Hb Tarrant (HBA asp126asn) and Hb Fukutomi (HBA asp126val) affect the same amino acid residue. Hb Tarrant was described in a homozygote from a family in which both parents were heterozygotes. The homozygote had 50 percent variant hemoglobin, a P50 of 9 mmHg, and a hemoglobin concentration of almost 19 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Curiously, the heterozygote father with 25 percent Hb Tarrant and a P50 of 14 mmHg had a similar hemoglobin level, whereas other heterozygotes have had more modest erythrocytosis.</p><p>Functional studies of oxygen binding in Hb Montefiore have revealed the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At pH 7.4, a 40 percent decrease in the p50 at pH 7.4 and a reduced n value of 1.6 (normal 2.6); depletion of red cell 2,3-BPG did not alter these results. At pH 7.2, an eightfold reduction in p50 (0.6 versus 4.6 mmHg) and a further decline in the Hill coefficient</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterotropic effectors, such as 2,3-BPG and inositol hexaphosphate, reacted normally, and, interestingly, increased cooperativity. The chloride ion effect and the Bohr effect were moderately reduced.</p><p/><p>Functional studies suggested that the very low n value and the high oxygen affinity of Hb Montefiore are due to both a destabilized T state that switches to R upon ligand binding and a deoxy T state that intrinsically binds ligand (eg, O2 and CO) with higher affinity than deoxy HbA. Although Hb Montefiore still bound ligand cooperatively, the difference in ligand binding properties of the T and R states was drastically reduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Alteration in the alpha1beta1 area of contact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in the alpha1beta1 area of contact can produce a major disruption in the overall conformation of hemoglobin, favoring the R state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hb Crete</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial reported patient with Hb Crete (HBB ala129pro) presented with a curious and complex syndrome of erythrocytosis, hemolysis, splenomegaly, abnormal red cell morphology and marked erythroid hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The index case was a compound heterozygote for Hb Crete and delta-beta-thalassemia, with 67 percent Hb Crete and 30 percent HbF. The delta-beta thalassemia deletion prevents the synthesis of any normal HbA. The unique red cells had a P50 of 11.3 mmHg; in comparison, isolated Hb Crete had a p50 of 2.2 mmHg at pH 7.3 (compared with 5.4 mmHg for HbA), moderately decreased cooperativity, and a normal Bohr effect. Hb Crete was also mildly unstable. Proline, the new amino acid formed in this mutation, is not accommodated in the helix and disturbs the H helix while also having a longer range effect on nearby residues in the alpha1beta1 interface, perturbing this area of subunit contact. Hemolysis was likely a result of hemoglobin instability.</p><p>This case is instructive. Splenomegaly is not usually associated with erythrocytosis caused by high oxygen affinity hemoglobins. In this patient, it was caused by coincident thalassemia. The high affinity of Hb Crete may have complex origins. Another family member who was heterozygous for Hb Crete alone had only 38 percent of this variant, a relatively normal blood P50 of 23 mmHg, and a packed cell volume of 50 percent. In the proband, the magnitude of the erythrocytosis was greater because the level of Hb Crete was much higher (67 percent) and HbF, which was increased, due at least in part to the thalassemia, also has high oxygen affinity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutations that decrease the affinity of hemoglobin for 2,3-BPG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>2,3-BPG is a potent modulator of the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Increasing levels of 2,3-BPG decrease oxygen affinity, shift the dissociation curve to the right, and increase the delivery of oxygen to tissues. 2,3-BPG is a polyanion that binds strongly to deoxyhemoglobin, stabilizing the T conformation and reducing oxygen affinity; binding takes place in the central cavity between the two beta chains where the negative charges of 2,3-BPG are neutralized by the beta NH2 terminus, beta2 histidine, beta82 lysine, and beta143 histidine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Three mutations of HBB 82lys (EF6) have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hb Rahere (lys82thr) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hb Helsinki (lys82met) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hb Providence (lys82asn&mdash;&gt;asp) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p>All of these hemoglobins have moderately high oxygen affinity and moderate erythrocytosis. The asparaginyl residue of Hb Providence is deamidated in vivo. These mutants have drastically reduced 2,3-BPG binding due to the elimination of one of the normal binding sites for this allosteric effector; 82lys is an invariant residue, suggesting the importance that evolution places on the binding of polyphosphates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">High affinity hemoglobins of uncertain mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some high affinity hemoglobins, such as Hb Heathrow, lack an explanation for their functional behavior. Hb Heathrow (HBB phe103leu) is an electrophoretically silent mutation with moderately high oxygen affinity and erythrocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This mutation affects an invariant residue that guards the entrance to the heme pocket. It is possible that a smaller side chain at the bottom of the heme pocket might alter ligand access or the electronic environment of the prosthetic group.</p><p>All possible single base mutations of HBB 99 disturbing the alpha1beta2 area of contact have been described; Hb Kempsey (HBB asp99asn), Hb Yakima (asp99his), Hb Radcliffe (asp99ala), Hb Ypsilanti (asp99tyr), Hb Hotel Dieu (asp99gly), Hb Chemilly (asp99val), and Hb Coimbra (asp99glu). All are present at 40 to 50 percent of the hemolysate, exhibit moderately high oxygen affinity, and are characterized clinically by erythrocytosis. Other properties of this group of mutants include: moderately decreased response to 2,3-BPG with Hbs Kempsey and Radcliffe and slightly decreased response to 2,3-BPG in Hb Hotel Dieu. Hbs Ypsilanti and Radcliffe form stable hybrid tetramers in the hemolysates in which the abnormal beta chains coexist with normal beta chains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of a high oxygen affinity hemoglobin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with high affinity hemoglobins have erythrocytosis but do not have increased white cell or platelet counts or splenomegaly. The absence of these findings distinguishes these disorders from polycythemia vera. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polycythemia-vera\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polycythemia vera&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients have a family history of polycythemia (&quot;thick blood&quot;) suggesting the existence of a genetic disease. However, high oxygen affinity hemoglobins have often been detected as &quot;new mutations&quot; in the absence of the abnormal hemoglobin among parents or siblings.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of increased red cell mass, the hallmark of erythrocytosis, is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76036 \">table 1</a>). The approach to erythrocytosis in patients without features of polycythemia vera is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-polycythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with polycythemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">High oxygen affinity hemoglobins and other red cell defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high oxygen affinity hemoglobin should be considered in patients with erythrocytosis who have an elevated serum erythropoietin concentration and normal pO2 and oxygen saturation. Individuals with these hemoglobin variants have high oxygen affinity red cells, high oxygen affinity hemolysates (ie, hemoglobin solutions), and a near normal red cell 2,3-BPG.</p><p>Two other disorders that should be considered in this setting are 2,3-BPG mutase deficiency and congenital methemoglobinemia. In the former disorder, the erythrocytes will have high oxygen affinity; however, in comparison with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins, the affinity of the hemolysate is normal and the level of 2,3-BPG is very low. In both disorders, the absorption spectrum of the hemolysate will be normal.</p><p>By comparison, congenital methemoglobinemia has an abnormal absorption peak at 620 nm and the level of CO hemoglobin can be assayed by a three wave length calculation, as the spectra of COHb and oxyHb differ significantly. Several gas measuring apparatuses like the CO-oximeter can, with the exception of some M hemoglobins, give an accurate reading of methemoglobinemia and carboxy-hemoglobinemia in whole blood.</p><p>Two steps are involved in the evaluation of patients with suspected high oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The red cell oxygen equilibrium curve is usually the benchmark for diagnosis. An accurate P50 value <strong>cannot</strong> be &quot;calculated&quot; from pO2 data as is often done. Both the saturation of hemoglobin and pO2 must be directly measured to obtain an informative P50 in these patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>). The Hemoscan-type apparatus is adequate for this purpose. In addition, an oxygen equilibrium curve of the dialyzed hemolysate must be obtained to exclude cytosol effects on ligand binding (such as a genetic reduction in 2,3-BPG). If this is not possible, the red cell oxygen equilibrium curve can be remeasured in 2,3-BPG depleted red cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a low P50 is documented, a search for an abnormal hemoglobin can begin. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the currently preferred means of hemoglobin separation, cannot detect all variants. Even if a variant is seen on HPLC, the mutation cannot be definitively determined by this protein separation method. If, on clinical evaluation and by P50 determination, a high affinity variant is suspected, sequencing the globin DNA will establish the mutation and diagnosis. The establishment of a diagnosis based on the genotype is necessary for genetic counseling.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Activating mutations of the erythropoietin receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activating mutations of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) producing erythrocytosis include truncation of the intracytoplasmic C-terminal domain, which negatively regulates the <span class=\"nowrap\">erythropoietin/EpoR</span> signal transduction pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. These patients have reduced or low-normal serum erythropoietin concentrations and increased sensitivity of BFU-E and CFU-E (erythroid precursors) to erythropoietin in vitro. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-pathogenesis-of-congenital-polycythemic-disorders-and-polycythemia-vera\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular pathogenesis of congenital polycythemic disorders and polycythemia vera&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic familial erythrocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of idiopathic familial erythrocytosis remains uncertain. It could be the product of alterations of the oxygen sensing system tied to erythropoietin (the hypoxic inducible factor) or other constituents of the EpoR signaling pathway (JAK-2, HCP, STAT 5). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some forms of familial erythrocytosis have normal oxygen affinity of red cells and hemolysate and are inherited recessively. Thus, some siblings, but not parents or descendants, should be affected. Erythrocytosis, due to homozygosity for a mutation of VHL is common in Chuvashia (Russia) and on the island of Ischia (Italy). Both population isolates share the same mutation and extended haplotype. This mutation alters the oxygen sensing pathway and erythropoietin levels are increased. It should be searched for in instances of unexplained erythrocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-pathogenesis-of-congenital-polycythemic-disorders-and-polycythemia-vera#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular pathogenesis of congenital polycythemic disorders and polycythemia vera&quot;, section on 'Chuvash polycythemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins accompanied by erythrocytosis have a benign clinical course and no apparent complications or splenomegaly, except when a confounding disorder is present. The lack of complications and the lack of necessity for treatment reflect the typically moderate increases in hemoglobin concentration and packed cell volume. An exception may occur in patients with Hb Malmo who may be symptomatic and benefit from phlebotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Low ambient pO2, as in unpressurized airplanes and ascent to altitude, do not represent a risk since high affinity hemoglobins are avid for oxygen. </p><p>Early diagnosis of high oxygen affinity hemoglobins avoids unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures, and inappropriate and often dangerous therapeutic interventions. Some patients, for example, have undergone cardiac catheterization, while others have received several courses of radioactive 32P treatment based upon a mistaken diagnosis of polycythemia vera. In general, any patient suspected of having polycythemia vera who is about to undergo a serious therapeutic intervention should have his or her whole blood oxygen equilibrium measured.</p><p>Several questions remain unresolved in patients with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why are similar hematocrits as those found in polycythemia vera much less pathogenic? A possible explanation is the presence of high levels of white cells and platelets in polycythemia vera, which can be additive to the contribution of red cells to the elevation in blood viscosity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there an added risk involved in pregnancy for mothers with high or low oxygen affinity hemoglobins? Increased morbidity or mortality in mothers or their offspring has not been observed. A study of a family, including their newborns, carrying a low affinity hemoglobin demonstrated that the reversal of the physiologic fetomaternal oxygen affinity had no effects on fetal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why does the magnitude of erythrocytosis vary among carriers of high oxygen affinity hemoglobins with a similar P50 (eg, as discussed above for Hb Tarrant (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hb Montefiore'</a> above)? Another example is seen with carriers of Hb Osler, who have the same P50 as patients with Hb McKees Rocks but have a hemoglobin concentration more than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> higher. A proposed explanation is better oxygen extraction by carriers of Hb McKee Rocks, who therefore do not require a higher red cell mass; alternatively, these patients may have differed in their ability to increase their red cell mass.</p><p/><p>The definitive answer requires a better understanding of polymorphic modifier genes (also known as epistatic genes) that vary among individuals and that could affect the compensation to hypoxia. Such an epistatic genetic effect might be present as evidenced by the differences in adaptation to hypoxia of high altitude among ethnic groups: the Sherpas of Nepal have a lower hematocrit, absence of chronic mountain sickness, and a normal oxygen equilibrium curve, compared with Quechuas and Aymaras, who adapted to the Andes with high hematocrits, have a tendency to chronic mountain sickness, and have right-shifted oxygen equilibrium curves. The genetic basis for these population differences have been partly characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW OXYGEN AFFINITY HEMOGLOBIN MUTANTS: CYANOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with low ligand affinity hemoglobin variants can have a slate gray color of their skin and mucous membranes. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyanosis is present from birth in some carriers of alpha-globin chain abnormalities since the alpha-globin genes are expressed from the time of early in utero development. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In carriers of beta-globin chain mutants, cyanosis may appear from the middle to the end of the first year of life as HbF levels decline and beta-chain synthesis increases to adult levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, in carriers of gamma-globin chain mutants, cyanosis is present at the time of birth but disappears when the transition from fetal to adult hemoglobin is complete, usually by about six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients with low oxygen affinity hemoglobins do not always have cyanosis.

The intensity of the cyanosis and extent of the decrease in oxygen affinity is inversely proportional to the length of the substituted side chain: maximal for serine, less for threonine, and least for tyrosine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Hb Kansas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hb Kansas, the first low affinity hemoglobin described and the best studied, has a whole blood P50 of about 70 mmHg (normal 27 mmHg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>), decreased cooperativity, and a normal Bohr effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The HBB 102asn residue is invariant among beta-globin chains and participates in the only hydrogen bond between asn102 and asp94 across the alpha1beta2 interface in oxyhemoglobin. This bond is broken when the molecule assumes the T state.</p><p>Examination of deoxyHb Kansas by difference Fourier X-ray diffraction analysis at 5.5 &Aring; resolution, has shown that the new thr residue is incapable of forming this bond. Thus, low oxygen affinity results from destabilization of the R conformer. In addition, other structural changes, which occur at the alpha1beta2 interface, account for the increased tendency of Hb Kansas to dissociate into dimers. This mutation is the mirror image, pathogenetically, of Hb Chesapeake (see above).</p><p>Replacement of the same HBB 102asn residue by lys in Hb Richmond is not accompanied by abnormal oxygen binding properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Crystallography has shown that the lys residue is capable of bridging the alpha1beta2 region and forming a salt bridge with the asp 94, providing further evidence for the defect in Hb Kansas. Nevertheless, since there are some abnormalities in the alpha1beta2 region on the difference Fourier maps, it has been suggested that reexamination of the oxygen equilibrium curve of Hb Richmond might be appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Hb Beth Israel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hb Beth Israel was found in a patient with cyanosis of the fingers, lips, and nail beds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. He had been severely disciplined early in life for constantly having &quot;dirty hands&quot; but the abnormal skin color was not noticeable to the patient or his parents. Cyanosis was detected by an observant surgeon about to perform a hernia repair.</p><p>The whole blood P50 was markedly elevated at 88 mmHg, and arterial blood was only 63 percent saturated despite a normal pO2 of 97 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>). The hemolysate also had a low oxygen affinity, a normal Bohr effect, and elevated erythrocyte 2,3-BPG. The molecular mechanism of reduced O2 affinity is the same as for Hb Kansas, although the defect might be more disruptive locally since the serine side chain is shorter than that of threonine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Hb Saint Mande</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hb Saint Mande makes up 38 percent of the hemolysate and migrates electrophoretically like HbF.

This special ligand quaternary structure also differed from Hb Kansas, which had an NMR spectrum similar to the T state quaternary structure in the liganded molecule. The tertiary conformation around the heme of both chains was altered, suggesting that the chain mutation propagated a conformation modification to the other subunit (long range interaction) involving 141 leu.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Hb Bruxelles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hb Bruxelles (HBB phe42del) is a deletion of the most conserved amino acid residue of hemoglobin. Phenylalanine residues at beta41 and beta42 are conserved in all normal mammalian non-alpha-globin chains and are indispensable for the structural integrity and oxygen-binding functions of the molecule. From age four years, the index case of Hb Bruxelles had severe hemolytic anemia and cyanosis, requiring blood transfusion once. Later in life, her hemoglobin concentration stabilized at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Reasons for this &quot;switch&quot; of phenotype are unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of a low oxygen affinity hemoglobin is part of the differential diagnosis of patients with cyanosis, particularly after much more common cardiopulmonary causes have been excluded. However, before undertaking expensive or risky invasive diagnostic procedures in cases of unexplained cyanosis, it is advisable to obtain a hemoglobin separation via HPLC and whole blood P50. A search for low affinity hemoglobins as an explanation for anemia in the absence of cyanosis is less compelling, since the yield is very low. Nevertheless, if other investigations prove fruitless, unexplained normocytic anemia deserves exploration at least by measuring the whole blood P50 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In individuals with low oxygen affinity variants, the oxygen saturation measured using pulse oximetry can be spuriously reduced.</p><p>A simple bedside test to distinguish cyanosis due to low oxygen affinity hemoglobins and cardiopulmonary cyanosis from that of methemoglobinemia, M hemoglobins, and sulfhemoglobinemia is to expose blood from the patient to pure oxygen. When cyanosis is due to low oxygen affinity hemoglobins or cardiopulmonary disease, pure oxygen will cause the color of the blood to change from purple-greenish to the bright red color of fully oxygenated blood. In contrast, blood of patients with methemoglobinemia, sulfhemoglobinemia, and M hemoglobins will retain its abnormal color despite exposure to pure O2.</p><p>As in all disorders of globin, the causative mutation can only be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the globin genes. Several reference laboratories are available for this purpose. The decision concerning which reference laboratory to send the sample to depends upon several factors. Many hospitals and medical centers have contractual agreements with one of the national reference laboratories (eg, LabCorp, Quest, ARUP, Mayo Clinic) and forward the samples to these laboratories for further analysis. Some institutions prefer to forward samples to one of the few laboratories that specialize in globin abnormalities. This choice may depend upon the familiarity of the referring clinician. In addition, there are three laboratories in the United States that specialize in globin abnormalities and are based in academic institutions.
