In addition, the widespread application of drug-eluting stents has greatly expanded the ability of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat patients with complex coronary anatomy.

Therapeutic angiogenesis is one such option and will be reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This approach is also being investigated for treatment of patients with peripheral artery disease, including both intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia.

These &quot;native bypass&quot; vessels could then relieve myocardial ischemia, improve regional and global left ventricular performance, lessen symptoms of angina, and potentially improve patient prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before discussing the various strategies that have been evaluated for therapeutic angiogenesis, it is important to review the terminology that is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term &quot;angiogenesis&quot; broadly refers to formation of new vessels. As currently understood, there are three major processes that result in new vessel formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculogenesis is a process of blood vessel formation from vascular progenitor cells. This is how the initial circulation forms during embryonic development. Studies in the 1990s and early 2000s suggested that there may be circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that can form vasculature in mature adult tissue. However, more studies have demonstrated that EPCs are in fact either circulating adult endothelial cells or, most frequently, a subset of monocytes and that no vasculogenesis takes place in adult tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These cells, however, may promote angiogenesis by the paracrine release of growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True angiogenesis is de novo capillary growth stimulated by tissue injury, hypoxia, or ischemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arteriogenesis is a process of formation of new arteries from either pre-existing collaterals or by de novo arteriogenesis, a process that likely involves arterialization of the capillary bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>The key drivers of angiogenesis are either ischemia, leading to a local activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression due to activation of hypoxic signaling via a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, or inflammation that leads to local accumulation of VEGF via release from infiltrating inflammatory cells. Thus, the typical processes associated with angiogenesis are wound healing (tissue injury, inflammation) and ischemia (eg, ischemic limb). In both of these cases, angiogenesis serves a physiologic purpose by either supporting new tissue formation in wound repair or increasing blood supply in the case of ischemia.</p><p>Pathological angiogenesis occurs in the setting of excess local VEGF production that does not serve a physiologic function. Two prime examples are diabetic retinopathy, excess capillary proliferation in the retina due to inappropriate local release of VEGF, and tumor angiogenesis.</p><p>In contrast, the biology of arteriogenesis is much less well understood. It is not an ischemia-driven process, as collateral arteries form in the areas close to the interruption of a major arterial trunk (eg, an occluded common femoral or a proximal coronary artery) and not in the distal bed, which is actually ischemic. It seems clear that recruitment of certain circulating mononuclear cells is of critical importance. These cells probably serve as reservoirs of growth factors that promote arterial remodeling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> de novo growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, how they achieve this effect is not understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Restoration of arterial blood supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic considerations strongly suggest that arteriogenesis, not angiogenesis, is the preferred type of neovascularization for restoration of myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p>The recruitment of certain circulating mononuclear cells is of critical importance. These cells probably serve as reservoirs of growth factors that promote arterial remodeling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> de novo growth. The incorporation of such cells themselves into the growing vasculature is a low frequency event that is not likely to be of major physiological importance.</p><p>In a typical patient with atherosclerotic coronary disease, the arterial blood supply to a particular area of the myocardium is compromised because of a high grade stenosis or occlusion of the coronary artery supplying that region. The most effective strategy to restore the arterial blood supply would be to provide an alternative bypass around the occlusion. Since atherosclerotic lesions primarily affect epicardial coronary arteries, the required &quot;bypass&quot; should be in the same size range to be able to carry bulk flow.</p><p>It is theoretically possible to restore the blood supply by markedly expanding the capillary bed in the territory served by the compromised coronary artery. However, the degree of expansion required for this purpose is massive and may not be achievable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Despite this limitation, no trial of therapeutic angiogenesis has specifically targeted arteriogenesis as its goal.</p><p>A number of angiogenic growth factors stimulate blood vessel growth, including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), VEGFs, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). However, none act independently and all have different and poorly understood biologic properties:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VEGFs (in particular VEGF-A) are involved both in capillary growth induced by tissue ischemia and in arteriogenesis. VEGF expression is extremely sensitive to changes in local tissue oxygen levels, a process regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. VEGF-A is usually present in limited quantities, thereby making regulation of protein levels extremely important for the biological function. Remarkably, even a 50 percent reduction in VEGF expression during development leads to lethality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition to its role in angiogenesis, VEGF also plays a key role in arteriogenesis, although how it achieves that is poorly understood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FGFs (FGF1, FGF2, FGF4, and FGF5) are abundantly expressed by various cell types. Secretion and cell death leads to accumulation of these long-lived proteins in the extracellular matrix. Further, in contrast to VEGFs, their expression is not sensitive to ischemia or hypoxia. In contrast, the expression of FGF receptors, including both tyrosine kinase receptor FGFR1-R4 and a proteoglycan receptor syndecan-4 is regulated by ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. FGFs are able to induce both capillary and arterial growth, thus participating both in angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. In contrast to VEGFs, FGFs appear to be particularly important in arteriogenesis with growing collaterals demonstrating abundant expression of FGF2 in surrounding monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES IN CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few of the challenges facing researchers in developing effective revascularization strategies using biologic agents will be briefly summarized here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The randomization of patients for therapeutic angiogenesis should be based upon age, sex, extent of hypercholesterolemia, and the extent of endogenous collateralization. This will require a sufficiently large number of patients (more than 400 per study arm) so that other unknown factors will be evenly distributed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with unstable angina, such as angina at rest, should be excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cancer screening has been carried out in therapeutic angiogenesis trails. There is no compelling evidence that patients should undergo extensive testing for pre-existing malignancies solely because of a decision to start therapeutic angiogenesis. On the other hand, there are disease processes such as proliferative retinopathy that are known to be sensitive to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and proteinuric renal diseases such as membranous nephropathy that may be sensitive to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Such patients should be excluded in clinical trials evaluating systemic administration of these growth factors.</p><p>One important question is whether there are populations of patients that are unresponsive to angiogenic therapies, such as patients with diabetes who are resistant to VEGF signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Unfortunately, there are currently no biomarkers available that would aid in selecting the correct population and in evaluating the therapeutic response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery of growth factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>How to effectively and safely deliver growth factors remains a major problem in therapeutic angiogenesis trials. Simple systemic (intravenous) infusions have either not been effective when used short term or have not been tried long term because of the fear of side effects. Methods of local delivery to the heart have included simple intracoronary infusion, which has been ineffective for both proteins and viruses; intramyocardial injections; pericardial administration; and locally applied polymer-based delivery.</p><p>It is not clear that any of these approaches is better than the others or that any are effective. Active research in this area includes retrograde coronary sinus delivery, and the development of effective delivery devices and noninvasive guidance techniques, such as electromechanical mapping that can distinguish between healthy and infarcted myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and live three-dimensional echocardiography that accurately locates the tip of the delivery catheter in space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein versus gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emerging consensus is that effective angiogenic intervention will require the prolonged presence (perhaps four to six weeks) of the therapeutic agent at the desired site of action. This cannot be achieved with single-dose injections due to the short half-life of proteins in tissues. Repeat administration or the use of a sustained release polymer may prove effective.</p><p>Both plasmid and adenoviral based gene therapy approaches suffer from relatively short expression times (one to three days for plasmid, 7 to 14 days for adenovirus) and, with plasmid, relatively low expression levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Trial end points</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the majority of patients currently being enrolled in therapeutic angiogenesis trials are selected on the basis of symptoms of angina and not life-threatening ischemia, quality-of-life measures should be the primary end point. Use of quality-of-life instruments such as the Short Form (SF) 36 (<a href=\"http://www.sf-36.com/&amp;token=vzhFnr64FDXRN9LtVh9psoJigmc/rstJ2tuSDz8FFho=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1537\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.sf-36.com</a>) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Ideally, an angiogenesis-specific, quality-of-life assessment tool should be developed. Such instruments, which should be self-administered, must be reliable, validated, and scored by standard algorithms. Since there is a strong placebo effect with regard to quality of life, the patient, the referring physician, and the investigator must be blinded to the specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Because of skepticism regarding subjective symptom assessment, much emphasis has been placed upon demonstration of physiologic improvements in myocardial perfusion and function. The goal is logical but has been technically challenging.</p><p>Exercise testing may or may not be a useful trial end point. Patients with variable baseline test results (&gt;30 percent difference) as well as those with only minimally impaired exercise tolerance should be excluded from clinical trials. Pharmacological stress testing may be preferred to exercise protocols. Semiquantitative or quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) analysis is the most accepted tool at present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pro-angiogenic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The field has been dominated by the use of various vascular growth factors including VEGF, FGF and hepatocyte GF (HGF). As already discussed, a number of patients appear to demonstrate resistance to VEGF and perhaps other growth factors. Animal trials show that unlike responses in young, healthy animals, VEGF (and other factors) are much less effective in older atherosclerotic or diabetic animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If the VEGF-activated arteriogenic pathway was clearly understood, agents could be developed to activate it, bypassing VEGF receptor signaling resistance in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">VEGF</span></p><p>There are five members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, with VEGF-A being the most extensively studied. VEGF therapy has been evaluated in studies administering the VEGF protein and in gene therapy trials in which the gene for VEGF was administered in a plasmid or viral vector.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">VIVA trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the initial open label phase I of VEGF-A intracoronary infusion in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) was interpreted as positive, this was not confirmed in VIVA, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial of intracoronary recombinant human VEGF (VIVA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this trial, 178 patients were assigned to placebo or to VEGF given at either low or high doses. The infusions were given into coronary arteries for 10 minutes, followed by three repeat intravenous infusions over the following nine days. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 60 days, there were no significant differences in exercise tolerance or angina class between the treated and control groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 120 days, patients receiving high dose VEGF had a significant improvement in angina class compared to the other two groups. However, nuclear perfusion imaging showed no differences among the three groups, raising doubt about the improvement in angina. This suggests that angina class may not be a good end point for trials of this intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">KAT trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The KAT trial randomly assigned 103 patients with symptomatic myocardial ischemia to VEGF DNA in a plasmid liposome, an adenoviral vector, or control via intracoronary infusion at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; 90 percent with stents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At six months, a significant improvement in myocardial perfusion using stress technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging was seen in patients receiving adenoviral VEGF, but not those treated with plasmid VEGF or controls. There were no significant improvements in exercise time, functional class, or restenosis rate. However, the use of PCI and the small numbers of patients make it difficult to interpret these findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Euroinject One trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Euroinject One trial randomly assigned 80 patients with advanced CHD but not further medical or revascularization options to receive either phVEGF-A (165) or placebo plasmid in the myocardial region showing stress-induced myocardial perfusion defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At three months, there were no significant differences between the groups on analysis of myocardial stress perfusion defects or on semiquantitative analysis of the change in perfusion in the treated region. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">NORTHERN Trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trial enrolled 93 patients with refractory class 3 or 4 angina and randomly assigned them to injection VEGF-A plasmid or placebo. There was no difference in VEGF-treated or placebo-treated patients after three or six months with regard to SPECT-assessed ischemic burden. Interestingly, both groups demonstrated a significant reduction in the ischemic burden over time.</p><p>Other members of VEGF family, such as VEGF-B and PlGF, have been tested in pre-clinical setting, but to date, there are no clinical studies of their efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTORS</span></p><p>There are 22 members of the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) growth factor family.

As an example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes monocyte activation and migration and can induce a local inflammatory reaction, changes that could promote atherosclerosis and plaque development. Consistent with this hypothesis are the observations in atherosclerosis-prone animals that human recombinant VEGF increased the rate and degree of atherosclerotic plaque formation in the thoracic aorta and that inhibitors of angiogenesis reduced intimal neovascularization and plaque growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hazards associated with viral vectors, as the transfection of cells with replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors may induce immune or inflammatory responses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hazards associated with direct myocardial delivery of angiogenic factors.</p><p/><p>Despite these potential complications, few significant complications have been observed in angiogenesis trials to date.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are patients with angina that is refractory to medical therapy who are not candidates for traditional revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG]) because of the inability to achieve complete revascularization or the high risk of CABG. Therapeutic angiogenesis is under investigation as one option for improving the quality of life in these patients.</p><p>The goal of therapeutic angiogenesis is the induction of new coronary arterial vessels that can effectively provide blood supply to the area of myocardium subtended by diseased or occluded native coronary arteries. A number of angiogenic growth factors stimulate blood vessel growth including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and many of these are under investigation. To date, none of them have been shown to have clinical utility.</p><p>The difficulty in translating experimental successes with pro-angiogenic therapy to clinical practice probably stems from three key sources: ineffective delivery (especially in myocardial angiogenesis trials), the presence of co-morbid conditions (diabetes, atherosclerosis, etc) that can inhibit angiogenic signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and advanced age of patients in trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Finally, it is also quite likely that choosing the &quot;no-option&quot; population for these trials results in selection of patients with genetic defects preventing new vessel formation.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mukherjee D, Comella K, Bhatt DL, et al.
