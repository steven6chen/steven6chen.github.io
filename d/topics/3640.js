The clavicle, also called the &quot;collarbone,&quot; connects the breastbone to the shoulder blade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82791\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82791 \">figure 1</a>). A clavicle fracture is when a person breaks his or her clavicle.</p><p>There are different types of clavicle fractures. The type of fracture depends on the part of the clavicle that breaks and how it breaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12160777\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a clavicle fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a clavicle fracture can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the area of the clavicle, especially when moving the arm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling over the injured area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising over the injured area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling the bone snap or crack (when the fracture happens)</p><p/><p>A clavicle fracture can also make the clavicle look like it's out of position or crooked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12160792\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a clavicle fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your injury and symptoms, do an exam, and order an X-ray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12160807\"><span class=\"h1\">How are clavicle fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of clavicle fracture you have and how severe it is.</p><p>Your doctor will treat your pain. If you have a lot of pain or a severe fracture, he or she will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If you have a mild fracture, he or she will recommend that you take an over-the-counter medicine for your pain. Over-the counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>Severe clavicle fractures, in which the broken ends are far apart or severely out of place, are treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor will put the clavicle back in the correct position.</p><p>Clavicle fractures that are not severe are usually treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. You should put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. You should use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sling or bandage &ndash; The main part of treatment involves keeping your clavicle from moving too much so that your fracture can heal. To hold your clavicle in place, your doctor will probably recommend that you wear a sling. A sling holds the arm bent and close to the body. Some people might wear a bandage that goes around the shoulders and upper back instead of a sling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The main downside of wearing a sling is that it keeps you from using your shoulder, elbow, and arm. Not using these parts of the body can make them stiff or weak. To prevent these problems, your doctor will show you exercises and stretches to do. He or she will tell you when to start them and how often to do them.</p><p/><p>After your fracture heals, your doctor might recommend that you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). He or she can show you other exercises and stretches for your shoulder, elbow, and arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12160822\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I expect as the bone heals?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clavicle fractures take weeks to months to heal, depending on the type of fracture. As they heal, they often develop a bony bump, which you can see and feel, at the fracture site. This is called a &quot;callus&quot; and is a normal part of healing. The callus might cause some minor discomfort but that is nothing to worry about.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12160837\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your clavicle fracture is healing. He or she will probably recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid certain activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking. A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12160852\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain, or your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or tingling in your fingers, or your fingers look blue or purple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have weakness or swelling in the hand or arm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pus drains from the injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin around the injury changes color, is irritated and thin, or is raised up.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12160867\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
