However, only patients with active bleeding (spurting or oozing), a nonbleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot are generally considered to be at high risk for recurrent bleeding. Most patients with high-risk stigmata require endoscopic therapy to decrease the risk of recurrent bleeding, whereas patients without these high-risk stigmata are considered low-risk and do not require endoscopic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers#H97408859\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers&quot;, section on 'Inpatient versus outpatient management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three types of contact thermal devices have gained popularity due to their efficacy, safety profiles, ease of use, and portability:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multipolar probes (Gold Probe, Quicksilver Bipolar Probe, BICAP Superconductor)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heater probe (HeatProbe) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monopolar probe (Coagrasper)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Multipolar probes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multipolar electrocautery (MPEC) probes achieve hemostasis by heating the contacted tissue with electricity that passes between the alternating arrays of positive and the negative electrodes located at the tip of the probe. The electrical circuit is completed between two electrodes on the tip of the probe, so the circuit is completed locally and no grounding pad is required.</p><p>Tissue coagulation occurs at the tip or sides of the multipolar probe when the tissue temperature reaches approximately 70&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The tissue's resistance to further coagulation increases exponentially once the tissue in contact with the MPEC probe has been completely desiccated. As a result, deep tissue coagulation is restricted. Coagulation depth can be increased by using large probes (10 rather than 7 French), using lower energy levels applied over a longer period of time, and using firmer contact (tamponade).</p><p>Coaptive coagulation is the goal of coagulation therapy of ulcers. By applying pressure directly over the vessel with the probe while applying cautery, the bleeding vessel is cauterized in a sealed state. MPEC probes can be used perpendicularly or tangentially to the lesion being treated since the electrode tip allows for therapy with any angle of surface contact, though the angle may affect the ability to apply pressure.</p><p>The standard MPEC probe permits water irrigation at the tip of the probe that facilitates washing the bleeding site, permitting improved visualization and precise application of endoscopic therapy. To prevent the probe from sticking to the area that has been treated, water irrigation via the probe can be applied after each application of cautery to gently separate the probe from the underlying area.</p><p>A catheter that combines an MPEC probe with a retractable injection needle (the Injection-Gold probe) allows for the direct use of combination therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection in conjunction with thermal therapy) without having to exchange catheters. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Heater probe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heater probe has a thermocouple at the tip of the probe that heats up quickly to provide tissue coagulation. Because it uses heat transfer across a ceramic tip as its mode of coagulation, the penetration of tissue coagulation is not limited by tissue water, resistance, or desiccation, as it is with the multipolar probes. As a result, deep coagulation is feasible with the heater probe; this effect can be dangerous if perforation is a concern, such as acutely bleeding lesions with thin bases. Heater probes must be applied perpendicularly to the lesion being treated, which can be a limitation when treating lesions in difficult-to-access locations (such as high on the lesser curvature of the stomach).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29109484\"><span class=\"h2\">Monopolar probe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monopolar probes designed for bleeding control are similar to hot biopsy forceps, except that the jaws are flat (not curved and cutting) and rotatable. Similar to other forms of monopolar technology (such as using a snare with cautery), a grounding pad is required. The technique for bleeding control is different than the other thermal contact devices in that the tissue for therapy is grasped with the forceps and pulled or &quot;tented&quot; away from the gastrointestinal wall, which helps limit the depth of the cautery. This device has been widely used to control bleeding during endoscopic maneuvers such as endoscopic submucosal dissection. Although experience in controlling nonvariceal bleeding is limited, thus far it seems that this has the potential to be another effective modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158746320\"><span class=\"h1\">USE IN PATIENTS WITH IMPLATED CARDIAC PACEMAKERS OR DEFIBRILATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When multipolar electrocautery is used, the current flow is localized to the area being treated, minimizing the risk of interaction between the probe and implanted cardiac devices. Unlike monopolar cautery devices (such as snares), multipolar electrocautery does not require special precautions to prevent interference with the cardiac device. </p><p>No specific precautions are required in patients being treated with heater probes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63421629\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thermal coagulation with multipolar or heater contact probes achieves acute hemostasis and prevents recurrent bleeding by coaptive coagulation of the underlying artery in the ulcer base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79058 \">picture 2B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70660 \">picture 2D</a>).

Large diameter (3.2 mm or 10 French) thermal probes are preferable. Other equipment to have on hand includes endoscopic hemoclips, an injection needle, snares (for adherent clot removal after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection), epinephrine (diluted 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 for injection), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> (for control of peristalsis).</p><p>In addition, a Doppler ultrasound probe may be helpful to confirm successful hemostasis, but is not required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63424264\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of endoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding is best performed with therapeutic gastroduodenoscopes that have a single large suction channel (3.7 to 6 mm diameter) or two suction channels (at least one large diameter). These endoscopes have a separate water jet for targeted irrigation of the bleeding site. A two-channel therapeutic endoscope permits high-volume suctioning through one channel, while a probe is down the other channel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63425527\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of probe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest similar efficacy with the two types of contact thermal devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In most cases, the choice between a multipolar probe and a heater probe will depend on which equipment is available in a given endoscopy unit or hospital. MPEC probes can be used both perpendicularly and tangentially relative to the bleeding lesion, but heater probes can only be used perpendicularly. In addition, inadvertent deep cauterization may be less likely with MPEC probes than with heater probes because the depth of cauterization is limited by tissue desiccation, something that does not occur with heater probes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Available devices'</a> above and <a href=\"#H63421685\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>When possible, it is preferable to use a large diameter probe (3.2 mm diameter or 10 French) through a therapeutic endoscope, although a smaller probe (2.3 mm diameter or 7 French) can be used through a standard endoscope. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63424313\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of Doppler ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler ultrasound probes can be used to help determine the risk of continued or ongoing bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The probes help visualize the underlying blood flow to determine whether hemostasis is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>An endoscopic Doppler ultrasound probe consists of a thin catheter that can be advanced through the biopsy channel of an endoscope with an ultrasound probe at the tip. It can be used to evaluate blood flow underlying the ulcer bed before and after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The Doppler ultrasound probe may be complementary to clinical standard endoscopic assessment of bleeding risk. The risk of recurrent or ongoing bleeding is increased when underlying blood flow can be seen beneath the ulcer, whereas recurrent bleeding is less likely when blood flow is absent upon completion of hemostasis.</p><p>The Doppler ultrasound probe was evaluated in a prospective trial in 79 patients (53 with peptic ulcers) who presented with upper GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of the 53 patients bleeding from ulcers, 49 percent had a positive Doppler ultrasound at baseline. Of the 19 patients whose Doppler ultrasound was positive at baseline but became negative after endoscopic treatment, only one rebled (5 percent). None of the patients whose Doppler study was negative at baseline had rebleeding.</p><p>By contrast, the 30-day rebleeding rate was 30 percent for a cohort of 38 patients whose endoscopic treatment was not based on Doppler ultrasound findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63424927\"><span class=\"h2\">Application of thermal coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thermal coagulation with contact probes achieves acute hemostasis and prevents recurrent bleeding by applying pressure to the vessel with the probe to compress it while coagulation is performed (coaptive coagulation). This results in sealing (coaptation) of the vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79058 \">picture 2B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70660 \">picture 2D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thermal coagulation is often used in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection (combination therapy). </p><p>A potential advantage of combination therapy is that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is easy to administer and it can help slow or stop bleeding prior to the application of thermal therapy. During active bleeding, this may improve visualization, permitting targeted treatment of the bleeding site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers#H97407324\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers&quot;, section on 'Injection therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63425487\"><span class=\"h3\">Active bleeding or a nonbleeding visible vessel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a bleeding site or nonbleeding visible vessel is identified (possibly with the aid of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection), the probe is used to tamponade the site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56986\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56986 \">picture 6</a>). The probe is then activated via a foot pedal to cauterize the site. The power level and duration of cauterization varies depending on the lesion. For patients with active bleeding, the goal is to achieve hemostasis. In patients with a nonbleeding visible vessel, good coagulation and complete flattening of the vessel should be the visual endpoints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79058%7EGAST%2F70660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79058 graphicRef70660 \">picture 2B, 2D</a>).</p><p>Many of the electrosurgical generators used with MPEC probes come with preset settings based on which part of the gastrointestinal tract is being treated. If a generator with preset settings is not available, we use the following settings with MPEC probes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active bleeding: Firm pressure, 15 to 20W, 10 seconds per pulse (prior to probe retraction), three to five pulses total</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonbleeding visible vessel: Firm pressure, 10 to 15W, 10 seconds per pulse (prior to probe retraction), three to five pulses total</p><p/><p>If a heater probe is used, it is typically set to 20 to 30J, with similar application times and pressures. However, if using a heater probe, four to five heater probe pulses should be delivered before repositioning the probe.</p><p>Irrigation via the probe is used to wash the ulcer base, to release the probe to prevent sticking after cautery, and to facilitate repositioning of the probe for further treatment if bleeding continues. Targeted irrigation and suctioning of excess blood or fluid are extremely important to identify the specific bleeding site and focus the treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63425754\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonbleeding adherent clots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the problems in assessing the risk for rebleeding in patients with an adherent clot is that the clot obscures the underlying ulcer stigmata. Nonbleeding vessels may be present underneath and are associated with a significantly higher rebleeding rate than minor stigmata, such as flat spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-22</a>]. Studies suggest improved outcomes when patients with adherent clots have the clots removed and receive appropriate treatment of underlying stigmata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-thermal-devices-for-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. As a result, if the clot can be removed, our approach is to remove it and then treat the underling lesion. However, it is reasonable to not attempt removal of the clot if it is located in an area that is likely to be difficult to treat if bleeding is precipitated, if appropriate surgical or interventional radiology backup is not available, or if the endoscopist is not comfortable with the techniques used for clot removal.

The clot is then cold guillotined with a polypectomy snare (without electrocoagulation) to shave it down (avoiding shearing of the clot) to reveal any underlying stigmata. Only a small portion of the clot is removed with each closing of the snare to decrease the risk of accidentally capturing the vessel within the snare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the clot is removed, if there is bleeding or a nonbleeding visible vessel, the site is coagulated, using an approach based on the lesions appearance.

Furthermore, it permits exposure and precise targeted treatment of the underlying ulcer stigmata.</p><p>An alternative to mechanically removing the clot is to irrigate the clot with 3 percent hydrogen peroxide using a spray catheter.

Thus, predetermined limits (volume of injection solution, total treatment pulses, and total energy delivered) should be set and not exceeded for each technique in order to minimize the risk of complications.

In patients at increased risk for cardiac complications from epinephrine, one option is to further dilute the epinephrine to 1:100,000.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1305744763\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Several endoscopic approaches can be used to treat bleeding peptic ulcers, including use of contact thermal devices, endoscopic hemoclips, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection.

Coaptive coagulation involves applying pressure to the vessel with the probe to compress it while coagulation is performed. This results in sealing (coaptation) of the vessel. It can be used in patients with active bleeding, a nonbleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot (following clot removal).

Studies suggest that multipolar electrocoagulation and heater probes have similar efficacy rates.
