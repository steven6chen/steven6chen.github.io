Most of these cases were caused by renal phosphate wasting, leading to the alternate name of &quot;phosphate diabetes.&quot; This disorder is now called hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets because the primary problem is now recognized to be phosphate wasting rather than true vitamin D resistance. </p><p>By contrast, true vitamin D resistance is characterized by hypocalcemia, as well as hypophosphatemia, and results from an inherited defect in the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or in the calcitriol receptor that limits the interaction with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children&quot;, section on 'Hereditary resistance to vitamin D'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children#H266914855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children&quot;, section on '1-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Hereditary forms of hypophosphatemia or hypophosphatemic rickets include X-linked, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive diseases, as well as hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria. The X-linked form is most common; the other forms are rare, with fewer than 100 reported cases. An acquired disorder, tumor-induced (or oncogenic) osteomalacia, has similar clinical manifestations to the familial syndromes. In addition to hypophosphatemia, these disorders all have normal serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Most of these disorders also have high circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a circulating hormone that causes renal phosphate-wasting and is a common final pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82448 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The etiology and treatment of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and evaluation of rickets and osteomalacia are discussed separately.

A number of studies indicate that the functional renal tubular abnormality in patients with XLH, and in the corresponding mouse model (<em>Hyp</em> mouse), is caused by one or more circulating factors rather than by a defect in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Because these circulating factors promote phosphate excretion and impair bone mineralization, they have been termed &quot;phosphatonins&quot; or &quot;minhibins&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The gene responsible for XLH was identified on chromosome Xp22.1 and named <em>PHEX</em> (<strong>Ph</strong>osphate regulating <strong>E</strong>ndopeptidase on the <strong>X</strong> chromosome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This gene codes for a cell surface-bound protein-cleaving enzyme. <em>PHEX</em> is expressed predominantly in bone and teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the altered function of this bone-derived endopeptidase causes the renal phenotypic abnormalities of XLH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A large number of inactivating mutations in <em>PHEX</em> can cause XLH and there is no obvious correlation between genotype and phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a study of 118 families with at least one case of hypophosphatemic rickets, <em>PHEX</em> mutations were found in 87 percent of familial cases and in 72 percent of sporadic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Interestingly, those with a sporadic mutation pass the disease to their children in an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, in some cases of familial and sporadic disease in which typical exonic <em>PHEX</em> mutations are not apparent, intronic <em>PHEX</em> mutations have been detected that result in mRNA splicing abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Additional &quot;sporadic&quot; forms of the disease (11.5 percent) are due to a novel single-base change near the polyadenylation signal in the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of <em>PHEX</em> (c.*231A&gt;G mutation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The principal phosphatonin involved in the pathogenesis of XLH is fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Mutations in <em>PHEX</em> (in bone tissue) indirectly alter the degradation and production of FGF23, causing increased circulating levels of the phosphatonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. FGF23, in turn, acts as a counter-regulatory hormone to inhibit phosphate reabsorption by the <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/phosphate</span> cotransporter in the kidney, acting through specific FGF receptors with the important co-factor klotho protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Elevated levels of FGF23 also appear to be an important common pathway for other forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, as well as tumor-induced osteomalacia, although the mechanisms for the increased FGF23 vary among these disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82448 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Treatment of XLH with phosphorus and vitamin D supplementation leads to increased FGF23 levels. Analogous manipulation in <em>Hyp</em> mice and another <em>PHEX</em> mutant mouse model of XLH also results in increases in serum FGF23, suggesting that the set point for FGF23 production is altered by mutations in <em>PHEX </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]<em>. </em></p><p>Thus, FGF23 appears to mediate the renal phenotypic abnormalities of XLH, primarily phosphate-wasting; the resultant hypophosphatemia contributes to, but is not fully responsible for, the bone demineralization and rickets, suggesting that FGF23 may not mediate all elements of the XLH phenotype. Experimental evidence in transgenic animals suggests that the majority of the mineralization defect may involve mechanisms other than FGF23-mediated phosphate wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Some of the other clinical manifestations of XLH (such as enthesopathy and dental abnormalities) also may be mediated by mechanisms other than FGF23.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypophosphatemia, slow growth, and rickets or osteomalacia are the major clinical findings. Low serum phosphorus is often present soon after birth. However, it is only at the time of weight-bearing that leg deformities (eg, bowing) and progressive departure from normal growth rate become sufficiently striking to attract medical attention. Most children have radiographic evidence of rickets, particularly at the growth plates around the knee, which can cause severe bone pain. The axial skeleton often has a dense appearance. Enthesopathy (calcification of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules), craniosynostosis, and dental abscesses are also common findings, particularly in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Younger siblings of affected patients should be screened to diagnose the disorder before these complications develop. Screening can be accomplished by measuring fasting serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase and, if necessary, renal phosphorus excretion. &#160;</p><p>The defects in bone mineralization in XLH consistently respond well to treatment with phosphate and calcitriol, but the effects of this treatment on skeletal growth are highly variable. One study suggests that the severity of the growth defect in affected children and the response to therapy may be predicted by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) promoter genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this study, more than one-third of patients with XLH had a VDR Hap1(-) promoter genotype and this was associated with severe growth defects (86 percent had an adult height at or below -2 standard deviations [SD] despite treatment). In contrast, only 11 percent of patients with a VDR Hap1(+) promoter genotype had a poor response to treatment (adult height below -2 SD). The height burden from Hap1(-) promoter status was evident before treatment, as early as the third to fourth year of life, and likely reflects the refractoriness to treatment of children who present with height below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In such cases, recombinant growth hormone has been tested as an adjuvant treatment of short stature. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> below.). </p><p>Defects in dentin may cause dental abscesses and early tooth decay in young adults. Hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], left ventricular hypertrophy, and craniosynostosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] have been identified in many of these patients, although it is not clear if these abnormalities are due to the disease itself or to the treatment (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In particular, there is an association between hypertension and hyperparathyroidism, which frequently develops as a consequence of treatment regimens that include oral phosphate supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] (see <a href=\"#H30486909\" class=\"local\">'Hyperparathyroidism'</a> below). Despite hypophosphatemia, muscle weakness is not a prominent feature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rickets in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-defects-of-the-teeth#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental defects of the teeth&quot;, section on 'Dentin defects'</a>.) </p><p>XLH is completely penetrant, but the severity varies widely, even among members of the same family. Whether boys are more severely affected than girls is a matter of debate. However, in the largest reported series of XLH patients, no gender difference in disease severity was detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In addition to hypophosphatemia and a decreased tubular reabsorptive threshold for phosphorus, patients with XLH have normal serum levels of calcium, normal-to-high parathyroid hormone levels, increased (or normal) alkaline phosphatase activity, normal plasma calcidiol concentration, and normal or slightly reduced plasma calcitriol concentration. The last finding suggests that calcitriol synthesis is abnormal in XLH because the hypophosphatemia fails to elevate circulating levels of calcitriol. The defect appears to be at the level of translation of the 25(OH)D-1alpha-hydroxylase mRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Iliac bone biopsies (not necessary for diagnosis in uncomplicated cases) show osteomalacia and hypomineralized periosteocytic lesions that are typical for this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Determination of the <em>PHEX </em>mutation may be useful to confirm the diagnosis and mode of heritability. Early diagnosis in newborns may be facilitated by knowing which mutation runs in the family, but it is not clear whether this information improves clinical care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy for XLH depend upon whether treatment is directed at children or adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current therapy for XLH has been used for more than 30 years and consists of the oral administration of phosphate and calcitriol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The administration of phosphate transiently increases the plasma phosphate concentration, which lowers the plasma ionized calcium concentration, and further reduces the plasma calcitriol concentration (by removing the hypophosphatemic stimulus to its synthesis). This causes secondary hyperparathyroidism because of both hypocalcemia and removal of the normal inhibitory effect of calcitriol on parathyroid hormone (PTH) synthesis. The elevated PTH levels can aggravate the bone disease and increase urinary phosphate excretion, thereby defeating the aim of oral therapy. The administration of calcitriol is necessary to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium, and to a lesser degree phosphate, in an effort to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism; calcitriol also suppresses PTH release directly. (See <a href=\"#H30486909\" class=\"local\">'Hyperparathyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) is administered in two doses per day (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/kg</span> per dose). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phosphate is administered in four to five doses that are equally spaced throughout the 24-hour period; the starting dose is 40 mg of elemental <span class=\"nowrap\">phosphorus/kg</span> per day. In our experience, a nighttime dose is important to achieve satisfactory results. Some catch-up growth should be noticeable within the first year of therapy. If this does not occur despite good compliance, the daily phosphorus dose should be increased in steps of 250 mg to 500 mg up to a maximum of 3500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p>Addition of a calcimimetic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a>) to the traditional regimen has been advocated to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The rationale for this strategy is that reduction of PTH levels should limit the renal phosphate wasting caused by elevated FGF23, allow the use of lower doses of phosphate and calcitriol, and reduce the risk of nephrocalcinosis. Calcimimetics have been used effectively to reduce PTH in chronic kidney disease and in tumor-induced osteomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, long-term studies in children with XLH are necessary before calcimimetics can be generally recommended. Newer therapeutic strategies based on the molecular pathogenesis of XLH are under development. As an example, treatment of <em>Hyp</em> mice with a neutralizing antibody to FGF23 or an inhibitor of FGF receptor signaling normalizes the biochemical abnormalities of the disease and improves, but does not eliminate, the skeletal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p>Preliminary investigations of the human anti-FGF23 monoclonal antibody KRN23 (burosumab) administered subcutaneously to children and adults with XLH is showing favorable clinical and biochemical effects, as well as radiographic healing of the rickets (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02750618&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPP+kQux3cQ3U8sNsrV/N8mD+Db633QBjlN703ndldjH6A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5802\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02750618</a>, <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02163577&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPOrsKxp6xIERolnfDqkoauW3S/oBIQLAtvhfu4G+YNErg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5802\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02163577</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia, short-term (four months) subcutaneous administration of this antibody at escalating doses significantly decreased renal phosphate wasting and increased the serum phosphorus concentration in 60 to 85 percent of treated subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The effects of KRN23 on osteomalacia have not yet been examined. Inhibition of FGF23 effects limits the phosphate wasting and normalizes the serum phosphorus concentration. To date, this therapeutic approach has a good safety profile. </p><p>Various forms of phosphate salts are available (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium phosphate</a>) with no obvious advantage of one preparation over another. Tablets usually contain 250 mg elemental phosphorus per pill. Children who cannot take pills can receive phosphorus supplementation in the form of Joulie's solution (155 g of dibasic anhydrous sodium phosphate and 64 g of phosphoric acid 85 percent per liter solution, corresponding to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of elemental phosphorus).</p><p>The amount of phosphorus supplementation is usually limited by the occurrence of diarrhea. If diarrhea is a problem, the dose of phosphorus should be decreased by 250 to 500 mg and then gradually re-increased in steps of 125 mg. The aim should be to administer the minimum amount of phosphorus that is sufficient for normal growth. Slow growth and persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase activity indicate inadequate dose of phosphorus or compliance with therapy.</p><p>Children should be seen every three months to monitor height, serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and urinary calcium:creatinine ratio. Renal ultrasonography should be performed once per year to evaluate nephrocalcinosis (see <a href=\"#H30486902\" class=\"local\">'Nephrocalcinosis'</a> below). A radiograph of the distal femur and proximal tibial sites are assessed every two years to exclude the reappearance of rickets and to determine bone age.</p><p>The primary goals of treatment in children are to correct or minimize <span class=\"nowrap\">rickets/osteomalacia,</span> as assessed by radiographic abnormalities and resolution of skeletal abnormalities. A common misperception is that successful treatment requires normalization of the serum phosphate concentration, which is often not a practical or attainable goal in affected patients, because of symptomatic response to the medicines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> long-term complications, such as nephrocalcinosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Thus, important measures of therapeutic efficacy should include enhanced height velocity, improvement in lower extremity bowing and associated abnormalities, and radiographic evidence of epiphyseal healing. A failure to obtain these endpoints should trigger a review of adherence to treatment and dose adjustment, if necessary and practical. With the exception of a small percentage of affected patients who are innately resistant to therapy, maintenance of acceptable height velocity and improvement in skeletal deformities generally indicate adequate dosing. </p><p>In the majority of prepubertal children who are treated with this medical regimen, radiological signs of rickets disappear, growth improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], and deformities of the lower limbs are prevented or corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The outcome of treatment has been enhanced by the use of epiphysiodesis (growth plate clamping) employing &quot;staples&quot; or a commercially available system (brand name: eight-Plate) to mechanically straighten lower extremities during growth by clamping endochondral bone formation at the lateral or medial physes, as appropriate, diminishing the need for osteotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other effects of therapy include an elevation, but not normalization, in the plasma phosphate concentration, increase in urinary calcium excretion, marked improvement in bone or joint pain, and a significant decrease in osteoid thickness and mean osteoid volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The characteristic hypomineralized periosteocytic lesions persist on biopsy even though the histologic appearance of osteomalacia improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Since the aim of treatment is to achieve normal growth, therapy is maintained as long as the growth plates are open (usually up to the age of 15 to 17 years).</p><p>An alternative form of treatment in <em>Hyp </em>mice, hexa-D-arginine (D6R), administered intraperitoneally (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g/day</span> for 5 weeks), has been reported to rescue the renal and bone (mineralization defects) phenotype in the animal model, by normalizing a downstream <em>PHEX</em>-dependent abnormality that increases the circulating concentration of FGF23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is controversial whether adults should continue therapy on a routine basis.

However, most of these patients have few if any skeletal complaints. Such patients may not benefit from therapy, whereas they may experience complications. As a result, it may be preferable to restrict treatment to those patients who are symptomatic.

In addition, adult patients may benefit from treatment during the three to six months prior to an orthopedic procedure, because this may reduce recovery time and the risk of prosthetic loosening in patients undergoing joint replacement. Adults should be monitored at least annually for serum phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and PTH. Measurement of serum alkaline phosphatase is not necessary as this variable is not always elevated in adults and does not reflect disease activity since the epiphyseal growth plates are closed. </p><p>The goal of therapy is to resolve the precipitating factor leading to initiation of therapy. In the case of bone pain, treatment can be discontinued with resolution or improvement of the pain. However, in some patients the pain reoccurs, sometimes requiring chronic treatment with relatively low doses of calcitriol and phosphorus. One observational study of 52 adults with XLH reported that treatment was also associated with reduced dental abscesses, but was not associated with improvement in radiographically determined enthesopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>It is less clear whether therapy should be prescribed in pregnant women with XLH. Most women with the disorder who are receiving active therapy at the time of conception are continued on treatment throughout the pregnancy, with vigilant monitoring of the urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio to detect hypercalciuria early in order to modify treatment accordingly. Although the plasma phosphate concentration of the fetus is determined by diffusion across the placenta, it seems reasonable to maintain a higher level of phosphate in the pregnant mother than that in the untreated state. Nonetheless, women who are not on therapy at the time of conception are generally not started on treatment during pregnancy. Studies are necessary to determine if hypophosphatemia during pregnancy affects bone mineralization or development in the fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two important complications of the treatment of XLH: nephrocalcinosis and hyperparathyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30486902\"><span class=\"h4\">Nephrocalcinosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrocalcinosis can be demonstrated on renal ultrasonography in up to 80 percent of patients with XLH and is associated with renal tubular acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41</a>].

The degree of calcium phosphate deposition correlates with the mean phosphate dose but not with the dose of calcitriol or the duration of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/38,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,42</a>].</p><p>Although most patients have a normal plasma creatinine concentration, the long-term effect of nephrocalcinosis on renal function is not known. However, normal kidney function has been maintained in XLH despite long-standing medullary nephrocalcinosis. Isolated cases of renal insufficiency have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and in the authors' experience occurs in the presence of hypertension. &#160;</p><p>It has been speculated that the development of nephrocalcinosis results from intermittent episodes of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.

Thus, careful monitoring and control of serum and urine calcium is necessary to minimize nephrocalcinosis. The dose of calcitriol should be reduced when hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria occur. Alternatively, administration of thiazide diuretics with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> may arrest the progression of nephrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> below).

It is thought that complexing of calcium with phosphate supplements results in intermittent hypocalcemia and persistent stimulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release despite the administration of calcitriol. When this secondary hyperparathyroidism is not adequately controlled, autonomous (tertiary) hyperparathyroidism can occur, necessitating surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

Several mutations in the fibroblast growth factor 23 gene (<em>FGF23)</em> causing ADHR (including R176Q, R176W, R179Q, R179W) have been reported, each resulting in an amino acid change at <sub>176</sub>RXXR<sub>179</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/S<sub>180</sub>,</span> a subtilisin-like protein convertase (PC) consensus cleavage site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/12,55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,55-59</a>]. </p><p>However, serum FGF23 concentrations are not consistently elevated in individuals with ADHR and the severity of renal phosphate wasting may wax and wane; FGF23 concentrations are normal during quiescent periods when serum phosphate levels are normal, and they are elevated during active, hypophosphatemic phases of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Hypophosphatemic flares often coincide with the onset of menses and following pregnancy, when iron deficiency is common. In addition, high FGF23 concentrations and low serum phosphate in patients with ADHR are associated with low levels of serum iron and ferritin. These findings led to the discovery that iron deficiency is an environmental trigger that stimulates expression of bone FGF23 mRNA and protein in both normal subjects and in patients with ADHR. In the absence of a genetic defect, iron deficiency does not result in high FGF23 levels or phosphate wasting, because increased expression of FGF23 is matched by increased FGF23 cleavage; in patients with ADHR, the ability to increase FGF23 cleavage is impaired, which results in high FGF23 levels when iron stores are low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Such impaired FGF23 cleavage is also an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of X-linked hypophosphatemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82448 \">figure 1</a>).

Approximately one-half of individuals harboring a mutation in the causal gene present clinically evident disease at ages one to three years, which includes phosphate wasting, rickets, and lower extremity deformities. In some affected children, hypophosphatemia and the phosphate-wasting defect persist into adulthood, whereas in others these abnormalities remit after puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The remaining patients have delayed disease onset, ranging from 14 to 45 years.

Such delayed presentation has been observed only in women, soon after puberty or pregnancy and delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited experience is available in the treatment of autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets. However, because the clinical, biochemical, and radiographic characteristics of ADHR are similar to those of X-linked disease (XLH), analogous treatment schedules for phosphorus and calcitriol are used. Because iron deficiency may contribute to the expression of hypophosphatemia, as discussed above, patients should be evaluated for iron deficiency, followed by iron repletion if needed, with ongoing monitoring of iron status. A case report describes a patient with ADHR who improved and no longer required treatment with phosphorus and calcitriol after correction of iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Such variability is associated with the different mechanisms causing defective gene function. The disorder has been divided into three subtypes: ARHR1 is caused by inactivating mutations in the <em>DMP1</em> gene, which encodes Dentin matrix protein 1; ARHR2 is caused by an inactivating mutation in the <em>ENPP1</em> gene, which encodes ectonucleotide <span class=\"nowrap\">pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase</span> 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]; AHRH3 is associated with mutations in the <em>FAM20C</em> gene encoding a protein kinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In these forms of the disease the mutations result in increased FGF23 protein production and defective osteocyte maturation.

If necessary, genetic testing for mutations in the <em>FGF23</em> gene can exclude ADHR, while testing for mutations in the <em>PHEX</em> and <em>DMP1 </em>or <em>ENPP1</em> genes can exclude XLH and ARHR, respectively. </p><p>Finding the tumors can be a major diagnostic challenge since their small size and obscure locations make them difficult to localize with conventional imaging techniques. Because in vitro studies have revealed that mesenchymal tumors frequently express somatostatin receptors, <sup>111</sup>indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy, a scanning technique that uses a radiolabeled somatostatin analog (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>) has been successful in localizing the tumor in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. Successful tumor localization has been reported with other imaging techniques, such as whole body MRI and [<sup>18</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">F]FDG-PET/CT</span>. Systemic venous sampling for FGF23 has also been used to localize causative tumors, but this technique is better suited to determine if an identified mass is producing FGF23. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning using <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE has been reported to be particularly sensitive in detecting causative tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/95-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-99</a>]. Further, studies indicate that a stepwise approach of <sup>68</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">Ga-DOTATATE-PET/CT,</span> systemic venous sampling for FGF23 levels, and 3-Tesla (3T)-MRI can be effective for tumor diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Despite these varied approaches, the small size of the tumors and their location in bone limit the ability to identify and localize the tumor; success rates in various studies reveal tumor identification in 65 to 80 percent of patients with presumed TIO.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive treatment for TIO is complete tumor resection, which leads to prompt reversal of the biochemical abnormalities and healing of the bone disease over a period of 6 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-84</a>]. However, if the tumor is not localized by the techniques outlined above, medical management is required. Although there is limited experience with medical treatment of TIO, the clinical, biochemical, and radiological characteristics of the disease are similar to those in XLH. Therefore, analogous treatment regimens are used for TIO. Therapy is continued indefinitely if the tumor cannot be identified and removed. In a few cases, however, recurrent search for the tumor, at various intervals after medical therapy is initiated, has resulted in successful localization of the tumor and cure of the syndrome upon its removal.</p><p>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> is an alternative form of medical therapy that may be considered when the tumor cannot be found despite intensive search. In one case report, phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia were corrected with octreotide therapy; this effect was presumably mediated by somatostatin receptor expression by the tumor, which was demonstrated by octreotide scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. However, not all such patients respond to octreotide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2336486570\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These include X-linked, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive disease, as well as hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria. The disorders are caused by mutations in one of the genes that control renal phosphate reabsorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82448 \">figure 1</a>). The X-linked form is most common; the other forms are rare. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is a dominant disorder caused by a variety of mutations in the <em>PHEX</em> (<strong>Ph</strong>osphate-regulating <strong>E</strong>ndopeptidase on the <strong>X</strong> chromosome) gene. It is characterized by hypophosphatemia, slow growth, and rickets or osteomalacia; both boys and girls are affected. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'X-linked hypophosphatemia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for XLH consists of the oral administration of phosphate and calcitriol. The phosphate is given to replace renal losses, and calcitriol is necessary to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium, to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism, and to suppress PTH release directly. This therapy is continued at least through adolescence; it is controversial whether adults should continue therapy on a routine basis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) have been described in a few families. The clinical manifestations and treatment approaches are similar to those in XLH, but vary with the age of onset. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three syndromes have a constellation of abnormalities that includes hypophosphatemia and hypercalciuria: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), Dent's disease, and idiopathic hypercalciuria. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Hypophosphatemia with hypercalciuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most patients with HHRH present with rickets <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteomalacia. However, milder forms may present with hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis but no signs of bone disease. Unlike XLH, plasma calcitriol concentrations are normal or appropriately elevated for the degree of hypophosphatemia; treatment is with phosphorus supplementation alone. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dent's disease is an inherited cause of nephrocalcinosis and rickets, with an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Dent's disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dent disease (X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor-induced osteomalacia is characterized by severe hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia, with renal phosphate-wasting and an inappropriately low plasma calcitriol concentration that occurs in association with a tumor. If growth plates are still open, rickets can occur. The tumors are typically benign, small, and of mesenchymal origin, and most often secrete FGF23. The metabolic pathways involved and clinical manifestations are similar to those of XLH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82448 \">figure 1</a>). Unlike XLH, the family history is negative and the disorder is acquired. Tumors can be detected by a variety of radiographic techniques and curative treatment depends upon complete resection of the culprit tumor.
