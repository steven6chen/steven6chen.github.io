This gland makes thyroid hormone, which controls how the body uses and stores energy.</p><p>The thyroid gland sometimes makes too much or too little thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism is the medical term for when this gland makes too much thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism is the medical term for when this gland makes too little thyroid hormone.</p><p>Thyroiditis after pregnancy can cause hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or both (one after the other). This condition happens within a year of being pregnant. That means it can happen after a woman has a baby, miscarriage (when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb), or abortion (when a woman chooses to end a pregnancy).</p><p>The medical term for thyroiditis after pregnancy is &quot;postpartum thyroiditis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6252043\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of thyroiditis after pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroiditis after pregnancy can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Sometimes people have symptoms of hyperthyroidism and then symptoms of hypothyroidism.</p><p>Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, even when you eat normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a fast or uneven heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating a lot and having trouble dealing with hot weather</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling worried</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trembling</p><p/><p>Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having no energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble having bowel movements (constipation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not making enough breast milk, if you are breastfeeding</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6252058\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for thyroiditis after pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check if you have this condition, your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and order blood tests.</p><p>Sometimes doctors order other tests, such as an ultrasound of the thyroid gland. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6252073\"><span class=\"h1\">How is thyroiditis after pregnancy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, women don't need any treatment. The condition usually gets better on its own, and the thyroid gland works normally again. This usually takes 6 months to 1 year.</p><p>Until you get better, your doctor will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do blood tests on a regular basis to check your thyroid hormone levels. If your condition worsens, you will need treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat your symptoms. Symptoms from hyperthyroidism are treated with medicines called &quot;beta blockers.&quot; Symptoms from hypothyroidism are treated with thyroid hormone pills.</p><p/><p>Although uncommon, thyroiditis after pregnancy sometimes causes long-lasting hypothyroidism. If this happens, you will need life-long treatment with thyroid hormone pills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6252088\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with thyroiditis after pregnancy are likely to get this condition again after future pregnancies. If you get pregnant again, let your doctor or nurse know so that he or she can monitor your thyroid hormone levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6252103\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
