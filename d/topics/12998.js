The term &ldquo;acute CPP crystal arthritis&rdquo; is now preferred in place of &ldquo;pseudogout&rdquo; to describe the latter instance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chondrocalcinosis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Chondrocalcinosis refers to radiographic calcification in hyaline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrocartilage. It is commonly present in patients with CPPD, but is neither absolutely specific for CPPD nor universal among affected patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pyrophosphate arthropathy &ndash; </strong>The term, pyrophosphate arthropathy, is sometimes applied to the joint disease or radiographic abnormalities accompanying CPPD. This name, however, has little justification in terms of the pathologic anatomy of the disorder, although abnormalities in pyrophosphate metabolism contribute to mechanisms of CPP crystal formation and deposition. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease is a disease of older adults, and radiographic surveys demonstrate an age-related increase in the prevalence of articular chondrocalcinosis. There is no major sex predominance, although attacks of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis, which are often termed pseudogout, occur more frequently in men, while osteoarthritis with CPPD is more common in women.

Crystal formation may reflect elevated levels of either calcium or inorganic pyrophosphate, matrix changes that enhance local calcium pyrophosphate supersaturation, or a combination of these factors. Aberrations in both mineral and organic phase metabolism are probably variably involved in calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease.</p><p>Two lines of inquiry relate to evidence suggesting that the disorder is associated with excessive cartilage inorganic pyrophosphate production, which leads to local calcium pyrophosphate supersaturation and CPP crystal formation or deposition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of these data suggest that excessive pyrophosphate levels, arising from nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPPH) enzyme overactivity, provide the substrate for CPP crystal formation in the immediate environment of chondrocytes. Increased concentrations of substrate (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) for this enzyme are also present in joint fluids from persons with CPPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, substantial evidence suggests a role for polymorphisms in the <em>ANKH</em> gene in both familial and sporadic human CPPD disease.</p><p/><p>First, several observations indicate that augmented pyrophosphate production in cartilage extracts from some patients appears to result from overactivity of one or more of a group of NTPPPH enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These enzymes are associated with the external surface of the chondrocyte cell membrane and are capable of catalyzing the production of pyrophosphate by the extracellular hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates, especially adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One function of extracellular pyrophosphate appears to be to bind to and inhibit the growth of basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals. In addition, studies in mice (the &ldquo;tiptoe-walking&rdquo; mouse strain) provide evidence that deficiency in NTPPPH enzyme activity can disrupt the normal reciprocal relationship between extracellular pyrophosphate levels and BCP crystal growth and deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this mouse strain a point mutation and deficiency in the NTPPPH enzyme PC-1 (phosphodiesterase; nucleoside pyrophosphatase) is associated with excessive axial skeletal mineralization with BCP crystals and eventual myelopathy. Thus, in CPPD, excessive pyrophosphate levels arising from NTPPPH overactivity could provide the substrate for CPP crystal formation in the immediate environment of chondrocytes.</p><p>One mechanism that might lead to CPP crystal formation and deposition involves enhanced ecto-NTPPPH activity, resulting from vesicles that play a role in normal bone calcification. Vesicles derived from collagenase digestion of articular cartilage are selectively rich in NTPPPH activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These NTPPPH-rich vesicles promote the formation of a calcium- and pyrophosphate-containing mineral that resembles CPP crystals when incubated with ATP. Such vesicles are similar to the matrix vesicles of normal epiphyseal cartilage. Among the isozymes with ecto-NTPPPH activity, PC-1 (originally described as a plasma cell membrane protein), when over-expressed through gene transfer to cultured chondrocytes, is associated with increased chondrocyte apoptosis and matrix calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The second line of evidence confirming enhanced pyrophosphate production in CPPD involves findings in another mouse disorder, murine progressive ankylosis, in which homozygous nonsense mutations in the ank gene result in reduced extracellular pyrophosphate levels and extensive peripheral and axial skeleton ankylosis with basic calcium phosphate-containing material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The <em>ank</em> gene product is a transmembrane protein, strongly expressed in chondrocytes, which serves either as a pyrophosphate transporter or as a regulator of a channel transporting pyrophosphate or a pyrophosphate precursor. Expression of the normal ank allele in transgenic mutant mice prevents the phenotypic and physiological defects of progressive ankylosis, and the overexpression of the normal ank allele in cells from mutant mice results in excessive extracellular pyrophosphate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These findings suggest that circumstances enhancing activity of the <em>ank</em> gene could promote CPP crystal formation and deposition. In addition to a putative role of the human homolog of the <em>ank</em> gene (<em>ANKH</em>) in pyrophosphate transport, there is now evidence that the <em>ANKH</em> gene product also promotes release of ATP by chondrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], thereby providing substrate for ecto-NTPPPH enzymes that generate extracellular pyrophosphate. However, the results of these studies should be applied with caution, given the artificial milieu in which in vitro studies of chondrocytes and cartilage are performed. The native environment of cartilage is hypoxic and chondrocytes are subject to mechanical stresses, both of which can alter ank expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence for a role of <em>ANKH</em> in both familial and sporadic human CPPD disease. In five instances of familial CPPD disease, segregation of the chondrocalcinosis phenotype with specific mutations in <em>ANKH</em> was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. In addition, <span class=\"nowrap\">mutations/polymorphisms</span> in or just upstream of the chromosome 5p locus of <em>ANKH</em> have also been identified in some individuals with idiopathic or sporadic CPPD deposition disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. Of interest, one such <em>ANKH</em> variant, a -4bp G&rarr;A polymorphism in the 5&rsquo; untranslated promoter region of <em>ANKH</em>, correlates with radiographic chondrocalcinosis that is independent of age or the presence of osteoarthritis, the two most common risk factors for chondrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Finally, <em>ANKH</em> transcripts and ANKH protein levels are reported to be increased in surgical cartilage specimens from patients with CPP deposition when compared with control specimens from osteoarthritis patients with no CPP deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of CPP crystals in disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proof of a definitive causal role of CPP crystals in all of the clinical manifestations with which deposition is associated has not been established, particularly for the degenerative, noninflammatory manifestations of CPPD arthropathy. Nevertheless, compelling evidence for a role of the CPP crystal in acute and subacute joint inflammation is provided by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are striking similarities in the pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical appearances of acute urate gout and CPP crystal-induced arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of particular note is the shared capacity of both crystal types to induce Nacht Domain-, Leucine-Rich Repeat-, and PYD-Containing Protein 3 (NALP3)-dependent inflammasome assembly and activation in synovial mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils. Activation of the NALP3 inflammasome, in turn, activates latent caspase-1, resulting in interleukin (IL)-1 precursor processing and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The apparent biologic consequences of the interaction of CPP crystals with phagocytic cells (which include mitogenic activation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines) provide a potential basis for the more subacute inflammatory synovitis of CPPD arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An etiologic or an amplifying role for CPP crystals in the destructive changes in osteoarthritis appears highly likely. The degenerative arthritis accompanying CPPD frequently involves such joints as the metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints, which are commonly spared in classical osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and chondrocalcinosis appears to be a primary determinant of the rate of radiographically-determined joint deterioration in osteoarthritis. Interestingly, in usual osteoarthritis, CPP crystals may not be present in early disease but appear to be secondarily associated with progression of the severity of the osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a study of cadaveric knees from Japanese older adults (mean age of 78), the deposition of CPP crystals correlated with the degree and depth of cartilage degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214187876\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous resolution of acute attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute attacks of CPP crystal arthritis are typically self-limited. Although possible mechanisms for ameliorating inflammation due to CPP crystals have been suggested, a generally accepted explanation is lacking. Phagocytosis and dissolution of crystals may play a role, but observations in patients together with data from animal models indicate that inflammation can abate while crystals are still present in tissue or fluid.</p><p>Adhesion of components of extracellular fluid or plasma to crystals may decrease their inflammatory potential. As an example, addition of lipoproteins to CPP crystals reduces their ability to provoke neutrophil phagocytosis and cell lysis in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

As noted above, in five pedigrees of familial CPPD disease, the presence of chondrocalcinosis segregated with a mutant form of the human homolog of the ank gene (<em>ANKH</em>), which encodes a transmembrane protein that is clearly involved in pyrophosphate transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemochromatosis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A 1992 literature review of reports of metabolic and endocrine diseases with proposed associations with CPPD disease concluded that hemochromatosis is the <strong>only</strong> disease clearly associated with the full spectrum of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystal-related joint disease, including acute arthritis, chondrocalcinosis, and chronic inflammatory and degenerative arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
