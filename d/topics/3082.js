These abnormalities can result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). The distinction between these disorders is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has primary hypogonadism if his serum testosterone concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sperm count are low <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> his serum LH and FSH concentrations are high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has secondary hypogonadism if his serum testosterone concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the sperm count are low <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> his serum LH and FSH concentrations are inappropriately normal or low, which would be inappropriate if gonadotroph cell function were normal.</p><p/><p>Secondary hypogonadism differs from primary hypogonadism in two characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hypogonadism is usually associated with similar decreases in sperm and testosterone production. This occurs because the reduction in LH secretion results in a decrease in testicular testosterone production and, therefore, in intratesticular testosterone, which is the principal hormonal stimulus to sperm production. In contrast, there is generally a greater fall in sperm production than in testosterone secretion in primary hypogonadism because the seminiferous tubules are damaged to a greater degree than the Leydig cells. Men with primary hypogonadism, therefore, might have normal serum testosterone and LH concentrations even when the number of ejaculated sperm is very low or zero and the FSH concentration is elevated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hypogonadism is less likely to be associated with gynecomastia, presumably because serum FSH and LH concentrations are not high and, therefore, do not stimulate testicular aromatase to increase the conversion of testosterone to estradiol.</p><p/><p>The major causes of secondary hypogonadism in males will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53205 \">table 1</a>).

In all three, the clinical presentation was delayed puberty and low testosterone in the men in the families, but the LH and FSH concentrations differed. In one family, LH secretion was not impaired, but its binding to its receptor was impaired, so serum LH concentrations were elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a second family, the mutation prevents dimerization of LH, so it is not secreted and the serum LH is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a third family, the mutation prevents normal intracellular processing of mRNA, so the serum LH concentration is undetectably low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Two different mutations were described in an additional patient with delayed puberty and azoospermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h4\">Beta-subunit of FSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another rare cause is a mutation in the gene for the beta-subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A man with this mutation had delayed puberty with low serum testosterone and FSH concentrations, but a high serum LH concentration. The low serum testosterone concentration is hard to explain because the Leydig cells do not have FSH receptors. However, this finding may indicate that normal human Leydig cell function is dependent on normal function of Sertoli cells, which do have FSH receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism associated with other hypothalamic pituitary hormonal deficits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary hypogonadism that occurs in association with impaired secretion of other pituitary hormones has been shown to result from impaired expression of transcription factors necessary for early differentiation of the pituitary during embryogenesis, including LHX3, LHX4, HESX1, and PROP-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some are associated with nonpituitary defects. Another genetic cause of multiple pituitary hormonal deficits is the stalk interruption syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

One or more of the following mechanisms may be involved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease or suppression of the hypothalamus, which impairs gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease of the pituitary stalk, which interferes with the ability of GnRH to reach the pituitary</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease or suppression of the pituitary, which directly diminishes luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion</p><p/><p>In general, a mass lesion in the pituitary or hypothalamus is more likely to diminish the secretion of gonadotropins than that of corticotropin (ACTH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonadal steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgens, estrogens, and progestins can suppress gonadotropins and thereby suppress testicular function. The high doses of androgens that athletes take cause suppression of gonadotropins after discontinuation, sometimes for many months, and during this time the man is hypogonadal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes&quot;</a>). The progestogen, megestrol, used for appetite stimulation, also causes secondary hypogonadism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic treatment with glucocorticoids can lead to hypogonadism. In one study, 16 men with chronic pulmonary disease who received high-dose glucocorticoid therapy for at least one month had a mean serum testosterone concentration of 211 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (7.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> compared with 449 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (15.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in 11 men matched for age and disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This probably represents an effect on the hypothalamus or pituitary since serum LH concentrations do not increase during chronic glucocorticoid treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous opiate administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When opiates are administered chronically, especially when they are administered continuously for relief of chronic pain, they often cause pronounced secondary hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one study of 29 men receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> intrathecally for chronic pain not due to malignancy, 25 had a subnormal serum testosterone concentration, whereas only 1 of 10 men, who had comparable chronic pain but was not receiving opioid treatment, had a subnormal value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In men being treated for opioid dependence, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>, is associated with low serum testosterone concentrations and sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any critical illness, such as surgery, myocardial infarction, or head trauma, can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. One study of 35 critically ill men, as an example, found that the serum testosterone concentration fell 43 to 58 percent within the first few days after the onset of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This effect could not be attributed to a decrease in binding of testosterone to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), because the percentage of free testosterone did not change. Thus, the low serum testosterone concentration was probably due to decreased secretion. Serum LH concentrations in these men also fell, indicating a pituitary or, more likely, hypothalamic cause of the hypogonadism.</p><p>A subsequent study of 59 men with critical illness demonstrated that the degree of hypogonadism was directly related to the severity of the illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51402\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51402 \">figure 1</a>) and that the hypogonadism resolved as the patients recovered from the illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70755\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70755 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An unanswered question is whether or not the hypogonadism is helpful or harmful to recovery from the critical illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic, systemic illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several chronic and systemic illnesses, including cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, chronic lung disease, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cause hypogonadism by a combination of primary and secondary effects.

In a review of 43 studies comprising 6427 men, the cross-sectional studies showed that men with type 2 diabetes had a mean serum testosterone concentration 76 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> lower than nondiabetic men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the same review, the longitudinal studies showed that men who had higher testosterone concentrations had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The relative roles of testosterone, obesity, and insulin resistance in this relationship, however, have not been delineated.</p><p>Not only is the total testosterone more likely to be low in men with diabetes, but the free testosterone concentration is more likely to be low as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10238486\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men who are overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25 to 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and obese (BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> tend to have lower serum concentrations of SHBG and, therefore, lower serum concentrations of total testosterone. Some obese men with low total serum concentrations due to low SHBG have normal free testosterone concentrations.</p><p>However, men who are obese may also have low free testosterone concentrations. These abnormalities were shown in a report from the European Male Aging Study in which data from 3220 men ages 40 to 79 years at eight sites were analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At all ages, both total testosterone and SHBG concentrations were lower in overweight men than in men of normal weight and lower yet in obese men. Free testosterone, however, was similar in normal weight and overweight men, but lower in obese men. Serum LH concentrations were not elevated in the obese men, indicating that the overweight men had secondary hypogonadism. In short, obese men may have a low total serum testosterone concentration because of a combination of low SHBG and secondary hypogonadism. Measurement of the serum free testosterone concentration is necessary to determine if an obese man's low total testosterone is due only to low SHBG or to secondary hypogonadism as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558988\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low testosterone levels have been reported in men with sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Treatment of sleep apnea with continuous positive pressure airway pressure (CPAP), however, does not appear to raise testosterone levels in these men, as shown by a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This analysis comprised five observational studies and two clinical trials with a total of 232 men in whom testosterone values were available before and after initiation of CPAP. The standardized mean difference between the testosterone values before and after the initiation of CPAP was -0.14 (95% CI -0.63 to 0.34). These results suggest that the low testosterone levels in men with sleep apnea may be the result of the concomitant obesity and not sleep apnea itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Damage to gonadotroph cells</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign tumors and cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any kind of pituitary adenoma or cyst can cause sufficient pressure on the gonadotroph cells to interfere with their function and decrease LH and FSH secretion.

When it occurs in older men and especially when it is of mild to moderate severity, it is not clear if it represents a disease. This is a common occurrence in older men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to older men with low testosterone&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2326384857\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The distinction between these disorders is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has primary hypogonadism if his serum testosterone concentration and sperm count are low and his serum LH and FSH concentrations are high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has secondary hypogonadism if his serum testosterone concentration and sperm count are low and his serum LH and FSH concentrations are inappropriately normal or low.</p><p/><p>Secondary hypogonadism differs from primary hypogonadism in two characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hypogonadism is usually associated with a similar decrease in sperm and testosterone production. This occurs because the primary reduction in LH secretion results in a decrease in testicular testosterone production and, therefore, in intratesticular testosterone, which is the principal hormonal stimulus to sperm production. In contrast, there is generally a greater fall in sperm production than in testosterone secretion in primary hypogonadism because the seminiferous tubules are damaged to a greater degree than the Leydig cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hypogonadism is less likely to be associated with gynecomastia, presumably because serum FSH and LH concentrations are not high and, therefore, do not stimulate testicular aromatase to increase the conversion of testosterone to estradiol.</p><p/><p>Causes of secondary hypogonadism can be divided into congenital abnormalities and acquired diseases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Congenital abnormalities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Acquired diseases'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Strobel A, Issad T, Camoin L, et al.
