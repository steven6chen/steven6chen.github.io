Osteoporotic fractures (fragility fractures, low-trauma fractures) are those occurring from a fall from a standing height or less, without major trauma such as a motor vehicle accident. There were an estimated nine million osteoporotic fractures worldwide in 2000, of which 1.6 million were hip, 1.7 million forearm, and 1.4 million clinical vertebral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fractures of the hip and spine are associated with an increased mortality rate of 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Fractures may result in limitation of ambulation, depression, loss of independence, and chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Properties that contribute to bone strength include bone mineral density (BMD), bone geometry (size and shape of bone), degree of mineralization, microarchitecture, and bone turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. BMD measurements are available to many patients, and fracture risk has been demonstrated to increase with decreasing BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Assessment of bone microarchitecture requires methodologies such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) or microMRI, or double tetracycline-labeled transiliac bone biopsy with histomorphometry, which are not routinely used in clinical practice.</p><p>Non-BMD factors that contribute to fracture risk include advancing age, previous fracture, falls, glucocorticoid therapy, family history of hip fracture and current smoking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Incorporating risk factors that are independent of BMD increases the sensitivity of fracture risk assessment and thereby improves treatment intervention strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Uni- and multivariate analyses suggest that age, prior fracture history, and BMD are the strongest predictors of fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Risk assessment for osteoporotic fracture will be reviewed here.

However, methodologies for combining BMD with clinical risk factors to quantify fracture probability offer attractive alternatives to relying on BMD testing alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, assessment of fracture risk should include evaluation of both:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical risk factors</p><p/><p>Fracture risk should be expressed as absolute, rather than relative, risk. Absolute risk (AR) provides a better assessment of the probability of fracture and is more useful clinically for identifying patients most likely to benefit from therapy. The use of a fracture risk prediction tool is helpful in identifying the probability of fracture over a specified period of time, typically 10 years. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Expression of fracture risk'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fracture risk assessment tool'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57538178\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone mineral density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1994, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a classification of BMD according to the standard deviation (SD) difference between a patient's BMD and that of a young-adult reference population. This value is now commonly expressed as a &quot;T-score.&quot; A T-score that is equal to or less than -2.5 is consistent with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 is classified as low bone mass (osteopenia), and a T-score of -1.0 or higher is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)'</a> below.)</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that low BMD is associated with an increased risk of fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/12,15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-21</a>]. Individuals with T-scores of &le;-2.5 have the highest risk of fracture. However, because there are more individuals with osteopenia than osteoporosis, the absolute number of fractures in subjects with T-scores in the osteopenia range is greater than in those with T-scores in the osteoporosis range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/7-9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,22</a>]. Since most fractures occur in patients with T-scores better than -2.5, treatment strategies relying solely on BMD testing will miss many patients at risk for fracture who might benefit from interventions to reduce fracture risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57538184\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of clinical risk factors that are independent of BMD is important for fracture prediction. In addition to BMD, advancing age, prior history of fragility fracture, chronic glucocorticoid use, low body mass index (BMI), parental history of hip fracture, cigarette smoking, and excess alcohol intake are the risk factors that have been demonstrated to be most predictive of fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Clinical risk factor assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical risk factor assessment alone may be considered for fracture prediction in world regions without access to any BMD measurement technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23</a>]. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2061\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX website</a>) model allows estimation of 10-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture with clinical risk factors alone when BMD is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fracture risk assessment tool'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Expression of fracture risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute risk (AR) is the probability of fracture, usually expressed as a percentage, over a specified period of time. Relative risk (RR) is the ratio of absolute risks of two populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. RR tends to overestimate fracture risk in some populations and underestimate it in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As an example, a 50-year-old and an 80-year-old woman with a hip T-score of -2.5 each have the same RR for hip fracture compared with an age-matched population with normal BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], while the 10-year probability of hip fracture is much higher in the 80-year-old woman (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67119 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For this reason, AR provides a better assessment of fracture risk and is a more useful clinical tool for identifying patients most likely to benefit from therapy. The preferred fracture risk expression for use in clinical practice is AR denoted as the 10-year probability of fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture risk assessment tool</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2008, the University of Sheffield launched a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2061\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX website</a>) that estimates the 10-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture (hip, clinical spine, proximal humerus, or forearm) for <strong>untreated</strong> patients between ages 40 and 90 years using easily obtainable clinical risk factors for fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 1</a>) and femoral neck BMD <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), when available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. DXA-equivalent femoral neck BMD derived from quantitative computed tomography (QCT) measurements may also be used with FRAX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; however, this is not recommended for use in clinical practice unless DXA is not available, due to greater radiation exposure and higher cost.</p><p>FRAX is based upon data collected from large, prospective, observational studies of men and women of different ethnicities and from different world regions in which clinical risk factors, BMD, and fractures were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/12,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28</a>]. FRAX has been validated in 11 independent cohorts, mainly comprised of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The statistical power of this large dataset allows estimation of fracture probability from an individual's set of risk factors. The country-specific FRAX prediction algorithms are available for many countries online (<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2061\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX website</a>); click on Calculation Tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The FRAX calculator is also available on current versions of DXA software and as an app for smartphones.</p><p>Results from a large, prospective cohort study suggest that FRAX can similarly predict fracture in women currently or previously <strong>treated</strong> for osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In this analysis, the FRAX-predicted risk and observed incidence of major osteoporotic fracture in both untreated and treated women were concordant. Only in the subset of women who were at highest risk for fracture and who were highly adherent to their osteoporosis treatment was the observed hip fracture incidence significantly less than the predicted risk. Thus, osteoporosis therapy may not preclude the use of FRAX for fracture prediction. However, FRAX does not appear to capture the change in fracture risk associated with therapy and should not be used to monitor individuals on therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Other fracture risk assessment models are available, but most have not been validated in diverse populations, and they are not in widespread use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical application of fracture risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When country-specific fracture data, life-expectancy data, and economic assumptions are used with FRAX, thresholds for cost-effective pharmacologic intervention can be calculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/28,35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,35-40</a>], allowing clinicians to identify patients likely to benefit from therapy better than currently available qualitative methods. Treatment guidelines based upon FRAX are likely to lead to more drug treatment in older patients with slightly low T-scores and high risk of fracture, with less use of drugs to treat younger patients with low T-scores and low risk of fracture.</p><p>In the United States, cost-effectiveness modeling suggests that the 10-year hip fracture probability at which treatment becomes cost effective (intervention threshold) ranges from 2.5 to 4.7 percent for women and from 2.4 to 4.9 percent in men, depending upon age and assuming annual treatment costs of USD $600 and a willingness-to-pay threshold of USD $60,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. For a 70-year-old woman initiating therapy, the intervention threshold is approximately 4 percent. Using similar willingness-to-pay thresholds but country-specific intervention costs, the intervention threshold in 70-year-old women from other countries ranges from 4 to 9.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Intervention thresholds vary based upon country-specific health economic data, such as fracture-related treatment costs and willingness-to-pay thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In most countries, the analysis is based upon five years of treatment with a bisphosphonate. The analysis in the United States was based upon the incidence of hip fracture in Caucasian, postmenopausal women and the expected cost of generic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> (before the actual cost was known) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/35,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42</a>]. Since the current cost of generic alendronate in the United States is less than the estimated cost, the fracture probability at which this treatment is cost effective is presumably less than what was calculated. Conversely, the use of more expensive nongeneric drugs increases the fracture probability at which treatment becomes cost effective.</p><p>Guidelines for pharmacologic intervention based upon 10-year absolute fracture risk are reviewed in detail separately.

As with all clinical tools, however, there are some limitations. Limitations include lack of extensive validation in treated patients, limitation to four ethnicities (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, Asian) in the United States, uncertainty regarding the range of error with fracture risk, and lack of validation with BMD measurements by technologies other than DXA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>] and QCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The FRAX algorithm uses femoral neck BMD <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> for calculation of fracture probability in untreated patients. BMD input from non-hip sites and other hip regions of interest has not been validated with FRAX and is therefore not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For patients who have lumbar spine BMD that is much lower than femoral neck BMD, FRAX is likely to underestimate fracture risk. It is noteworthy that the FRAX estimation of major osteoporotic fracture does not include all osteoporotic fractures, since a substantial portion of fragility fractures are not at the four &quot;major&quot; skeletal sites used in the FRAX algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Additional limitations, which may result in over- or underestimation of fracture risk in an individual patient, include dichotomous (yes or no) input for clinical risk factors that are associated with variable risk depending on dose and duration of exposure (eg, glucocorticoids) and lack of consideration of all risk factors (eg, multiple fractures, falls, bone turnover). While there is evidence that hip, vertebral, and humeral fractures appear to confer greater risk of subsequent fracture than fractures at other sites, quantification of this incremental risk in FRAX is not possible.</p><p>Thus, FRAX may underestimate fracture probability in individuals with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/43,44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44,46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar spine BMD much lower than femoral neck BMD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple or recent fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose glucocorticoid exposure (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> &gt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or equivalent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevalent, severe vertebral fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A parental history of non-hip fragility fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p/><p>The magnitude by which FRAX may over- or underestimate fracture risk has been studied using large population databases, and procedures for adjusting FRAX probability have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. As an example, an analysis of the Canadian Manitoba BMD database shows that when there is discordance between lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, the FRAX estimate for major osteoporotic fracture may be increased or decreased by one-tenth for each rounded T-score difference or offset between lumbar spine and femoral neck (eg, when the lumbar spine T-score is 1.0 less than the femoral neck T-score, the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture can be increased by one-tenth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Another analysis using the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database showed that for patients exposed to high dose glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> &gt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or equivalent), the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture may be increased by 15 percent and the 10-year probability of hip increased by 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The increase in fracture risk associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus may be captured by entering &quot;yes&quot; for rheumatoid arthritis in the FRAX algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. With modifications such as these, the FRAX probability of fracture can be refined. However, these correction factors have not been computed for the majority of countries represented by FRAX, including the United States. Thus, they should applied to United States populations with caution.</p><p>The clinician should appreciate that intervention guidelines with or without the use of FRAX provide only general clinical guidance. Osteoporosis treatment should remain individualized through shared decision-making between patient and clinician.

However, there are discrepancies in T-score values at different skeletal sites and with different technologies. The increase in fracture risk per 1.0 standard deviation (SD) decrease in BMD (fracture gradient) varies with the technique used and the skeletal site measured. Therefore, T-scores derived from different skeletal sites with different technologies are not interchangeable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/10,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,62</a>].</p><p>In clinical practice, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the only technology that can be used for diagnostic classification and is the most useful technology for monitoring serial BMD changes. However, other techniques measuring different skeletal sites have demonstrated the ability to predict the likelihood of fractures. Therefore, when BMD testing by DXA is not available, then fracture risk assessment may be made using other technologies (measuring lumbar spine, hip, or peripheral skeletal sites) in combination with consideration of clinical risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DXA measures bone mineral content (BMC, in grams) and bone area (BA, in square centimeters), then calculates &quot;areal&quot; BMD (aBMD) in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/cm<sup>2</sup></span> by dividing BMC by BA. DXA is the most widely used method for measuring BMD because it gives very precise and accurate measurements at clinically relevant skeletal sites (ie, those with major clinical consequences when a fracture occurs) and can be used for diagnostic classification, input with FRAX, and monitoring the response to therapy. The major disadvantages of DXA are that the instrument is large (not portable); more expensive than most peripheral technologies; and uses ionizing radiation, albeit in a very low dose.</p><p>Detailed information about DXA is found elsewhere.

Overall, there is an approximately twofold increase in risk of such fractures for each SD decrease in BMD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51324 \">table 3</a>).

The age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of vertebral fracture for each SD decrease in DXA-measured BMD of the lumbar spine and total hip was 2.1 (95% CI 1.8-2.3) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.6-2.0), respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a historical cohort study (mean observation 3.2&plusmn;1.5 years) of 16,505 Canadian women, each SD decrease in DXA-measured BMD of the hip or lumbar spine was associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture at any site (hazard ratio 1.8 [95% CI 1.7-2.0] for total hip and 1.5 [95% CI 1.4-1.6] for spine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Although low BMD at any skeletal site can predict osteoporotic fracture, site-specific measurements are generally better for their respective sites.

As an example, in two large, prospective cohort studies of community-dwelling older men and women, a 1 SD decrease in total hip BMD was associated with similarly increased risks of high- or low-trauma fractures (age-adjusted relative hazard [RH] 1.4 [95% CI 1.2-1.7] and 1.5 [95% CI 1.4-1.6] for high- and low-trauma fractures, respectively, in women and 1.5 [95% CI 1.2-2.0] and 1.7 [95% CI 1.5-1.9], for high- and low-trauma fractures, respectively, in men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Although the relationship between BMD and fracture appears to be similar regardless of the cause of fracture, the studies are limited by the broad definition of high-trauma fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. There is a level of force at which normal bone would fracture, independent of BMD. The ability to accurately define traumatic fractures that are unlikely related to low BMD would clarify which patients with fracture require an evaluation for osteoporosis. Those who sustain fractures from a level of force at which normal bone would not ordinarily fracture require evaluation for osteoporosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a>).

In addition, there are no studies showing reduction in fracture risk for patients selected for therapy based on QUS measurements, and QUS cannot be used to monitor response to therapy, because changes are too slow to be clinically useful.

QCT may be clinically useful to monitor changes in BMD over time for some patients with structural abnormalities of the spine that preclude the use of DXA.

Thus, new technologies and non-BMD DXA measurements have been developed that allow noninvasive assessment of bone strength. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a commercially available, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved software add-on for late generation DXA systems that uses data derived from lumbar spine DXA images to generate a gray-level textural index.

If BMD cannot be measured at either of these skeletal sites due to structural abnormalities, such as osteoarthritis or surgical artifact, then the distal 33 percent (one-third) radius should also be measured and considered for diagnostic classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>We recommend following ISCD recommendations (DXA of the lumbar spine and hip).
