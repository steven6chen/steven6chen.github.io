Amatoxin-containing mushrooms (eg, <em>Amanita phalloides</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73705 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67262 \">figure 1</a>), <em>A. virosa</em>, <em>A. bisporigera</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52731\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52731 \">picture 2</a>), <em>Galerina autumnalis</em>) cause approximately 50 deaths annually in Europe and Asia compared with a few deaths annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-8</a>]. This difference in frequency of lethal exposures reflects the relative popularity of mushroom foraging in Europe and Asia rather than significant variance in intrinsic toxicity or prevalence of harmful mushroom species among the regions. </p><p>When serious toxicity due to mushroom ingestion does occur, it typically results from consumption of a meal of misidentified mushrooms by foraging adults and others who shared their food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Amatoxins are not removed by boiling or otherwise cooking the mushroom. A common scenario involves amateur mushroom hunters or recent immigrants who mistake a toxic mushroom for an edible variety with similar morphologic features (eg, Amanita species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73705 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52731\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52731 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67262 \">figure 1</a>) mistaken for Agaricus species).

Physical characteristics of these mushrooms include a symmetric cap (pileus) and stem (stipe) with a bulbous base (volva) surrounded by remnants of a universal veil and free gills (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67262 \">figure 1</a>). They have no offensive taste or odor and typically grow as single mushroom in moist, hardwood chestnut or oak forests. They mature throughout the mid-summer and fall in temperate regions. Despite sometimes colored gills, white spores may be detected if a cap is left right side up on colored filter paper for 1 hour. Immature amatoxin-containing Amanita mushrooms are egg-shaped &quot;buttons&quot; that reveal their developing structures when bisected. Not all Amanita mushrooms contain amatoxin, including several edible types (<em>A. vaginata</em>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lepiota</strong> &ndash; Lepiota, including <em>L. josserandii</em>, are similar in appearance to the deadly white Amanitas and also have significant amatoxin content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. They are far less prevalent and are implicated in human exposures less frequently. Their caps are more pointy (umbonate) and more heavily covered in concentrically ringed scales.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Galerina</strong> &ndash; Galerina mushrooms (eg, <em>G. autumnalis</em>, <em>G. marginata</em>, <em>G. venenata</em>) are smaller and have lower concentrations of amatoxin. Galerina are brown and grow in groups directly from decaying wood. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26667340\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND TOXICOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amatoxins are cyclic octapeptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. Alpha-amanitin appears to be most responsible for human toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other cyclopeptide toxins (eg, phallotoxins or verotoxins) are felt to play a lesser role, if any, in human toxicity. Amatoxins are heat stable and insoluble in water, thus &quot;parboiling&quot; does <strong>not</strong> make cyclopeptide-containing mushrooms safe. The minimum lethal human dose of amanitin is 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or approximately one to two medium-sized mushroom caps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Limited observations following human poisoning and animal models suggest that amatoxins are incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and then are transported to the liver through the portal circulation. Active transport by the hepatocyte membrane proteins such as organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) and sodium taurocholate co-transporter (NTCP) concentrates the toxin within the liver cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p>Amatoxins have a low volume of distribution (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg),</span> and very low protein binding (0.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,17</a>]. They can be detected in blood and urine up to 48 hours after mushroom consumption. Most amatoxins are excreted in the urine. Biliary excretion and enterohepatic recirculation also occur with high levels of amatoxins measured in gastroduodenal fluid in poisoned patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4,5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,16</a>]. Interrupting biliary circulation and repeated doses of activated charcoal are strategies for the reduction of circulating amatoxin.</p><p>Once inside the cell, amatoxins bind to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase type II and halt intracellular protein synthesis, ultimately resulting in apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/12,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,18</a>]. Other organs with high output protein synthesis (rapid cellular turnover), including GI tract or proximal convoluted renal tubules may be affected. In severe human cases, synchronous centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis leads to fulminant hepatic failure and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Prevention of amatoxin uptake at the cellular level is one major strategy to reduce toxicity after ingestion. The strongest evidence exists for silibinin dihemisuccinate to specifically inhibit amatoxin hepatocyte uptake by OATP 1B3 whereas cyclosporin A, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> may generally reduce uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H394132\" class=\"local\">'Silibinin dihemisuccinate'</a> below.) </p><p>In addition, based upon animal studies in mice, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a> may reverse alpha-amanitin binding of RNA polymerase type II and prevent toxicity up to 12 hours after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, in humans, polymyxin B has significant toxicity including nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity that is amplified in the presence of renal injury as may occur with amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning. Thus, further studies in humans are needed before its use can be recommended. &#160;</p><p>Amatoxins do <strong>not</strong> appear to cross the placenta with normal neonatal outcomes observed in poisoned pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393811\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed onset of signs and symptoms more than 6 to 12 hours after mushroom consumption is consistent with a potentially serious amatoxin-containing mushroom ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,22</a>]. However, early onset of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms after mushroom ingestion does <strong>not</strong> exclude amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning if multiple toxic mushroom species were ingested.

Detection methods include polymerase chain reaction, high-performance liquid <span class=\"nowrap\">chromatography/mass</span> spectrophotometry, enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) or radioimmunoassay. Of these, ELISA testing for amanitin in the urine is the least technically challenging and has good sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Fresh, uncooked samples of all potentially ingested mushrooms that are harvested carefully or photographed in situ are ideal samples for identification but are rarely retrieved in practice. When instructing family members to bring in mushroom species that have been foraged, whole mushrooms are preferred, but identification can sometimes be made on parts of the mushroom, especially the underside of the cap and true base. Storage is facilitated by placing them in a paper bag and refrigerating the sample. Storage in plastic bags should be avoided. Unfortunately, patients typically forage and ingest multiple mushrooms.

This dose is much higher than the usual silymarin dose of 150 to 360 mg three times daily that is used for other liver diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amatoxin-containing-mushroom-poisoning-eg-amanita-phalloides-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. High doses of silymarin may produce significant diarrhea and may complicate management in some patients. Thus, the clinician may initially start with a trial dose of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum single dose: 2 g) of oral silymarin in capsule form every 8 hours and if tolerated, increase to a maximum of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose (maximum single dose; 3 g) for a duration of 6 days or until the patient shows signs of clinical improvement. In patients who do not tolerate the trial dose, lower doses may be attempted but may not provide hepatic protection. Successful oral administration may require aggressive treatment of vomiting with antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum dose; 16 mg) and replacement of fluid losses caused by diarrhea.</p><p>Evidence for the benefit of oral administration derives indirectly from the potential benefit of IV administration of silibinin (see <a href=\"#H394132\" class=\"local\">'Silibinin dihemisuccinate'</a> above).
