The challenge to the clinician is to differentiate between normal variants, benign findings, and potentially serious diseases.</p><p>This topic will discuss the diagnostic evaluation of women with vulvar lesions. The differential diagnosis of vulvar lesions is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis based on morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, the history is obtained before the patient undresses for her initial physical examination. In addition to a standard medical history, answers to the following questions can help identify possible causes of the vulvar lesion and exclude others. The answers to these questions may suggest a systemic disease rather than a primary localized vulvar disorder. The answers may also increase the clinician&rsquo;s suspicion of dermatitis or infection as the etiology of the lesion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long has the lesion been present? Was the onset sudden or gradual? Could it be related to trauma or another trigger?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How did the lesion look when it first appeared? Is it different now? Does it come and go?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What symptoms are associated with the lesion(s): itching, burning, pain, stinging, bleeding, and discharge? Does anything improve or exacerbate the symptoms? Do you have other non-vulvar symptoms, such as fever, urinary tract or bowel symptoms, abnormal uterine bleeding, weight loss, or joint pain?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The evaluation of women whose chief complaint is vulvar pain is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-localized-vulvar-pain-syndrome-formerly-vulvodynia-vestibulodynia-vulvar-vestibulitis-or-focal-vulvitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of localized vulvar pain syndrome (formerly vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, vulvar vestibulitis, or focal vulvitis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of generalized vulvodynia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have other skin lesions, such as oral, vaginal, or anal lesions?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you incontinent of urine or stool? Incontinence can cause vulvar irritation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do any family members have a history of vulvar disease? Genetic factors appear to play a role in some disorders that affect the vulva, such as psoriasis, lichen sclerosus, and hidradenitis suppurativa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are your normal skin care and hygiene routines? Do you use a face cloth to cleanse? What type of cleanser do you use and how often? Do you douche or use cleansing wipes? Do you use feminine hygiene sprays, sanitary napkins, tampons, or lubricants for sexual activities? Women often erroneously regard their personal practices as safe since they have engaged in them for a long time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you had any recent changes in medications, personal care products (eg, deodorants, fragrances, detergents, fabric softeners, soaps, lubricants, moisturizers), or occupational or recreational exposures?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did you travel before developing the lesion? A history of travel abroad widens the differential diagnosis of infectious diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has there been a change in sexual partner(s), which may suggest a sexually transmitted infection?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What treatments have you used (home remedies, prescription and over-the-counter products, drugs). What was the response to these treatments?</p><p/><p>The clinician should also assess how the lesion impacts activities of daily living and sexual activity. <span class=\"nowrap\">He/she</span> should try to obtain documentation of laboratory studies, biopsy results, and treatments from previous clinicians.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several steps can be taken to improve patient comfort during physical examination of the genitalia, including having a female assistant in the examination room (to help with visualization of the vulva) and talking to the patient during the examination. It is useful to have a mirror available so the patient can assist in identifying the concerning lesion. After the examination, patients should be allowed to dress before discussing the findings and management plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452073304\"><span class=\"h2\">Vulva</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The entire vulva and external genitalia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614 \">figure 1</a>) should be examined under a good light. The labia should be spread and carefully examined to avoid missing lesions hidden in redundant skin or hair.</p><p>The following characteristics of the vulvar lesion should be evaluated, and help to guide differential diagnosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis based on morphology&quot;</a>). Magnification with a magnifying lens, colposcope, or other forms of magnification can be helpful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesion morphology (eg, macule, papule, patch, nodule, ulcer, tumor, plaque, vesicle, bulla, pustule, cyst) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size and shape of individual lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edge clearly demarcated or poorly defined</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number, location, and distribution of multiple lesions (eg, scattered, grouped, linear, etc)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistency and feel (tenderness, thickness, <span class=\"nowrap\">hard/soft/firm/fluctuant)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of secondary changes (excoriation, lichenification, edema, scale, crust, fissure, erosion, bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo-/hyperpigmentation,</span> atrophy, scar)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute inflammation (edema, pain, erythema)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452073349\"><span class=\"h2\">Related anatomic examinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anus should be examined at the completion of the examination. The vagina, cervix, intertriginous regions, eye, mouth, and nares should be examined when the diagnosis is uncertain because vulvar lesions can be an atypical or typical manifestation of a more widespread disease, and recognition of other sites of involvement may help in diagnosis. For example, lichen planus can affect the vulva, vagina, and mouth. Aphthae can be seen on the mouth and genitalia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-lichen-planus-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H190861141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral lichen planus: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>). In women with candida vulvovaginitis, fissures and erythema may involve the interlabial sulcus and thigh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95804\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95804 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Several types of speculums are available for vaginal examination. The two main types are the Pederson-type (narrow blade) and the Graves-type (wide blade) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95809\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95809 \">picture 2</a>). A pediatric Pederson speculum may be required in patients with pain or scarred, foreshortened vaginas. Each type of speculum has options for view size: standard 30 mm width opening, 40 mm wide view opening, or 70 mm full view opening. Although larger sizes provide better visualization, they can also be more uncomfortable for patients. Alternatives for better visualization include use of an open-sided speculum; a Guttman style speculum, which functions without an upper blade; or a transparent plastic speculum for 360-degree visibility. Warming the speculum to body temperature and lubricating it with water or small amounts of lubricant enhance patient comfort.</p><p>Regional lymph nodes should be palpated for lymphadenopathy, which could be indicative of infection or malignancy.</p><p>If bruising or lacerations are noted, intimate partner violence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual assault should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200806022\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vaginal pH and wet mount may be helpful in patients with vaginal discharge to evaluate for conditions such as candida, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomonas, which may cause vulvar erythema. Saline wet mount preparation, vaginal pH, and amine odor (whiff) test are rapid and inexpensive methods to evaluate vaginal discharge, which may be the source of vulvar irritation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>). A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is used to detect fungal elements in vulvar skin scrapings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95811\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95811 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Vulvar ulcers may be present with certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). While genital herpes has traditionally been considered an ulcerative STD, it more often presents as an erosion. Herpes infections are frequently associated with ulcers in immunocompromised women. Other ulcerative STDs include syphilis and chancroid (very rare in the United States). The clinical characteristics and diagnosis of these and other ulcerative infections of the vulva are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers#H406530882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with genital ulcers&quot;, section on 'General approach'</a>.)</p><p>Bacterial cultures of the vulva are reserved for patients in whom there is suspicion the clinical findings are suggestive of bacterial infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27273400\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of atopic or contact vulvar dermatitis can usually be made clinically, based upon characteristic symptoms, a personal or family history of atopy, or personal history of vulvar exposure to medications, perfumes, or other chemicals. In uncertain cases and those not responding to treatment, patch testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy may be necessary to identify the <span class=\"nowrap\">allergen/irritant</span> or an underlying dermatosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27273116\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for intraepithelial lesions and cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the vulva (HSIL), previously known as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), are related to infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. They tend to be multifocal and located in the non-hairy part of the vulva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The lesions are often raised or verrucous and white (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72661\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72661 \">picture 4</a>), but the color may be red (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74997 \">picture 5</a>), pink, gray, or brown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75216\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75216 \">picture 6</a>). Macular lesions mostly occur on adjacent mucosal surfaces. There is no pathognomonic clinical appearance, and more than one of these patterns may be seen in the same patient. In addition, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, condylomata acuminata, and condyloma lata can mimic HSIL of the vulva. Therefore, biopsy is generally required for diagnosis. Vulvar cytology should not be performed because of poor correlation with tissue diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-cancer-epidemiology-diagnosis-histopathology-and-treatment-of-rare-histologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar cancer: Epidemiology, diagnosis, histopathology, and treatment of rare histologies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Colposcopy</strong> &ndash; Use of a colposcope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95810\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95810 \">picture 7</a>) may identify subclinical HSIL of the vulva not appreciated on physical examination and helps to define the extent of disease and guide biopsy. Because of the high prevalence of multicentric synchronous or metachronous intraepithelial lesions, comprehensive colposcopic evaluation of the perianal area is indicated in any patient with HSIL of the vulva (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colposcopy&quot;, section on 'Vulvar colposcopy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Colposcopy'</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, women with HSIL of the vulva should have <span class=\"nowrap\">cervical/vaginal</span> cytology before vulvar surgery. They should undergo follow-up set forth by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients in which the provider is concerned about HSIL of the vulva, application of gauze soaked with 3 to 5 percent acetic acid for three to five minutes will highlight (whiten) areas that represent HSIL, genital warts, hyperkeratosis, or carcinoma. This is useful for colposcopy-directed biopsy, but also for choosing biopsy sites performed under direct visualization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One or more vulvar biopsies should be performed in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions clinically suspicious for malignancy: asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, rapid change, bleeding, or non-healing ulcers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a diagnosis cannot be made confidently by visual inspection and other noninvasive methods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the lesion does not resolve after standard therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To address patient concerns.</p><p/><p>For example, we advise a biopsy for a woman who has been treated for candidiasis in an appropriate manner, but continues to have itching, erythema, and skin changes. She may have contact dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, HSIL of the vulva (formerly vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia), extramammary Paget disease, carcinoma, or one of numerous other conditions; thus, a biopsy is indicated for definitive diagnosis to direct further therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200806300\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar biopsies can usually be performed in the office. The indications and procedure should be discussed with the patient. Risks include bleeding, infection, scarring, nondiagnostic sample, and allergic reaction.</p><p>After proper positioning on the examination table, the selected site is prepped with a cleansing solution. One should avoid taking the biopsy from the clitoris, urethra, or anal opening, if another representative site can be biopsied, because of patient discomfort and risk of complications. However, these areas can be sampled if needed.</p><p>For patient comfort, at times a topical anesthetic (eg, 2.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 2.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> in a cream base) to desensitize the skin may be used before the anesthesia is injected. Before prepping the vulva, the topical anesthetic should be applied sparingly for 15 to 20 minutes on modified mucous membranes and longer on keratinized skin (up to 60 minutes depending on the agent and depth of the skin) before biopsy to be maximally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Effectiveness is enhanced when applied under occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After application of a topical antiseptic, the site is infiltrated with 1 to 2 percent lidocaine with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. Adequacy of anesthesia should be checked before proceeding with the biopsy; analgesia is achieved several minutes before vasoconstriction.</p><p>The choice of biopsy instrument depends on the lesion. A shave biopsy removes the top layer of skin and is used when the lesion is small and confined to the epidermis. It should not be used when melanoma is suspected. A punch biopsy removes a small (2 to 6 mm) circular piece of skin and is used when all skin layers need to be examined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95812\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95812 \">picture 8</a>); it is indicated when the pathologic process is dermal or in the subcutaneous fat. A biopsy forceps can also be used for vulvar biopsies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95813\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95813 \">picture 9</a>). In areas where tissue is fragile and likely to tear, a &ldquo;suture, lift, and cut technique&rdquo; is useful. A fine suture is placed to gently lift the skin and then iris or Metzenbaum scissors are used to cut the base of the tissue under the suture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96611\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96611 \">picture 10</a>). The suture is then removed from the excised skin specimen and the specimen is sent to pathology.</p><p>The biopsy technique also depends on the lesion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pigmented lesions &ndash; Ideally, atypical-appearing pigmented lesions are completely excised to ensure accurate depth assessment. More than one punch biopsy may be necessary to adequately sample a large, heterogeneous lesion and repeat biopsies may be necessary if the clinical and pathologic impressions do not correlate. The biopsies are obtained from the thickest region of the lesion and from any ulcerated areas, at the edge of the ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blistering lesions &ndash; The suture, lift, and cut technique described above is ideal for obtaining biopsy samples from blistering lesions. It is important to obtain a bit of the normal skin at the margin of the blister, rather than just the base of the blister.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcerated lesions &ndash; An incisional biopsy is performed when the ulceration is large and only a portion of the lesion is sampled; the sample should include the edge of the ulcer. An excisional biopsy to remove the entire lesion is appropriate when the lesion is less than 1 cm in size.</p><p/><p>Hemostasis is usually achieved with pressure or chemical hemostatic agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a>, Monsel&rsquo;s solution [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a>]) or aluminum chloride. Alternatively, electrocautery can be used. If bleeding is not controlled or the defect is large, the biopsy site is closed with a 4-0 absorbable suture, but small dry defects can be allowed to heal without closure.</p><p>After the procedure, the patient is instructed to keep the site clean and dry, and other wound care instructions (eg, sitz bath), if needed, should be reviewed. Plain petrolatum can be applied daily until the site is healed; dressings are typically avoided.</p><p>A detailed description of patient preparation, anesthesia, biopsy technique, wound closure and care, and specimen processing is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vulvar biopsy reports may return with nonspecific findings. If the biopsy is nondiagnostic, and a precancer or cancer is in the differential diagnosis, a repeat biopsy should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200806427\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound imaging or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used at times for evaluation of cystic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcutaneous lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27272970\"><span class=\"h2\">Documentation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Photography </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>In addition to written notes, photography is useful to objectively document the location, size, and morphologic features of vulvar lesions.
