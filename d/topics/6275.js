Eighty percent of cases are pleural in origin. The predominant cause of malignant mesothelioma is inhalational exposure to asbestos, with approximately 70 percent of cases of pleural mesothelioma being associated with documented asbestos exposure.</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology and risk factors of pleural mesothelioma.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and staging, and treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma are discussed separately.

The incidence of mesothelioma in the United States peaked around the year 2000 and is now declining, secondary to control of exposure to asbestos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The incidence is increasing in many other places in the world, particularly in Great Britain and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The rate has been predicted to peak around 2015 in England, and mesothelioma rates are expected to drop gradually thereafter. These changes are attributed to an understanding of the relationship of mesothelioma to asbestosis and reduced exposure in the workplace and the general environment. In contrast, mesothelioma incidence rates are predicted to increase dramatically in resource-limited settings secondary to poor regulation of asbestos mining and the proliferation of industrial and household utilization of asbestos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383327781\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asbestos exposure is the most important risk factor associated with subsequent development of pleural mesothelioma, and asbestos exposure is responsible for the bulk of the mesothelioma burden worldwide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Asbestos exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asbestos is the commercial name for a group of hydrated magnesium silicate fibrous minerals. Asbestos occurs in soil and rock as long fibers. There are two major types: serpentine and amphibole. About 95 percent of the asbestos produced and used worldwide is chrysotile, which is a serpentine fiber that is reportedly less carcinogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. However, even chrysotile asbestos has been linked to the development of pleural mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Asbestos is valued in industry for its resistance to heat and combustion. It is used in cement, ceiling and pool tiles, automobile brake linings, and in shipbuilding. In addition to occupational exposure, environmental exposure to asbestos from natural sources may contribute to the mesothelioma burden.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383327975\"><span class=\"h3\">Occupational exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efforts to control occupational exposure to asbestos can result in a significant decrease in the incidence of mesothelioma. The latency period after exposure to asbestos is very prolonged, with almost all cases appearing 15 or more years after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and the risk persists for many decades. However, the very prolonged latency between exposure and disease development means that a decrease in the incidence of mesothelioma occurs very slowly.</p><p>As an example, in the United States, as many as eight million living persons in the have been occupationally exposed to asbestos over the past 50 years. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initially established 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">fibers/mL</span> of air as the standard acceptable exposure. This level has since been reduced to 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/mL,</span> but this applies only to fibers longer than 5 micrometers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Workers exposed to higher concentrations of regulated fibers are mandated to use protective clothing, respirators, and showers.</p><p>Asbestos workers are at significant risk for the development of both non-malignant and malignant pulmonary disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 8 percent of asbestos workers will die of respiratory failure secondary to asbestosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average asbestos worker has a 50 percent chance of dying from a malignancy, compared with around 18 percent for the average American. The vast majority of cancers in asbestos workers involve the lung, either primary lung carcinoma or mesothelioma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lifetime risk of developing mesothelioma among asbestos workers is thought to be as high as 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is a latency period of approximately 30 to 40 years from the time of asbestos exposure to the development of mesothelioma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There appears to be a dose-response relationship between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. This was illustrated in cohort study of 4659 people who resided in an Australian city that produced crocidolite asbestos but who did not directly participate in its mining or milling; the incidence of mesothelioma increased significantly with greater environmental exposure, based upon the neighborhood and duration of residence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a cohort of textile workers with heavy exposure to asbestos, the risk of pleural mesothelioma was increased and was proportional to the latency period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unlike asbestosis, even a brief intense exposure to asbestos can result in mesothelioma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asbestos exposure acts synergistically with cigarette smoking to increase the risk of developing lung cancer 60 times over that of a similarly matched non-smoking, non-asbestos-exposed cohort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asbestos workers may also be at increased risk of non-mesothelioma gastrointestinal malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/5,6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383327969\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonoccupational exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental, nonoccupational exposure to asbestos also can contribute to an increased risk of mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>].</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In certain rural areas in Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria, soil contains remarkably high levels of tremolite asbestos fibers, and many cases of mesothelioma in these regions appear to be secondary to long-term nonoccupational asbestos exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/15-18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A role for nonoccupational exposure to asbestos was also supported by a study from California in which an increased incidence of mesothelioma was associated with proximity to naturally-occurring asbestos deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhalation of other fibrous silicates, such as erionite, has also been implicated as a potential cause of malignant pleural mesothelioma, as shown in epidemiologic studies of a region in Turkey (Cappadocia), which show an abnormally high incidence of pleural mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoro-edenite is a naturally-occurring mineral that forms amphibole asbestos fibers. Unpaved roads in Biancavilla, Sicily, Italy, are a source of airborne fibres and have been linked epidemiologically with the development of mesothelioma, in the absence of occupational exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation to supradiaphragmatic fields may be a risk factor for the subsequent development of mesothelioma, with a long latent period between the initial treatment and the diagnosis of the second malignancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two large studies from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database found that survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were at increased risk for mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The increased risk was limited to those who had received radiation as part of their treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based series of over 40,000 men treated for testicular cancer between 1943 and 2001 and followed long-term found 10 excess cases of pleural mesothelioma (relative risk 4) for men treated with radiation therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The data for patients with breast cancer are conflicting. An analysis of 22,140 patients treated in 11 National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) trials identified three cases of mesothelioma, all occurring in women who had received radiation therapy to the ipsilateral thorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In contrast, a SEER database cohort of over 250,000 could not identify a link between radiation therapy and subsequent development of pleural mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although prophylactic mediastinal irradiation is no longer used in testicular germ cell tumors and its use has been sharply curtailed in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there are a substantial number of cancer survivors who remain at risk for the late development of mesothelioma.

In one report, 22 patients who developed mesothelioma following chest irradiation as part of their treatment for Hodgkin disease or non-Hodgkin lymphoma were compared with 1596 cases associated with asbestos exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients with treatment-related mesothelioma were significantly younger (median age 45 versus 64 years) and had a significantly longer overall survival (32.5 versus 12.7 months).</p><p>The development of malignant pleural mesothelioma has also been associated with other sources of radiation exposure. In one study, exposure to external radiation at nuclear facilities was associated with a significant increase in mesothelioma risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In rare cases malignant pleural mesothelioma has been associated with intrapleural thorium dioxide (Thorotrast), a radioactive contrast agent in the 1930s and 1940s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbon nanotubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbon nanotubes share similar dimensions and chemical properties with asbestos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Several studies identified SV40 nucleic acids in a large proportion of mesothelioma cases (some of which did not have obvious asbestos exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. However, a number of epidemiologic studies have failed to confirm these observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1416281290\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial clustering of pleural mesothelioma has been noted, with one study describing an elevated risk for mesothelioma among those whose parents or siblings were diagnosed with the disease of 3.9- and 12.4-fold, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Regarding specific genes that have been implicated, inactivation of the nuclear deubiquitinase <em>BAP1</em> is associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma. <em>BAP1</em> appears to regulate key histones and transcription factors related to the development of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

More recent data suggest that somatic mutations of <em>BAP1</em> may be present in up to 60 percent of mesotheliomas. In addition, germline mutations in <em>BAP1</em> were identified in two families with a high incidence of mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Loss of <em>BAP1</em> may predispose to cancer after asbestos exposure; testing for mutations in this gene might eventually be used to identify patients at high risk who could be targeted for early intervention. Loss of <em>BAP1</em> seems to be part of a larger familial cancer susceptibility syndrome, most often associated with ocular melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
