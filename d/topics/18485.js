Surgical repair is one approach to treatment: Approximately 200,000 women undergo surgery for POP and 135,000 women undergo surgery for SUI annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and approximately 11 percent of women undergo surgery for POP or SUI by age 80. However, some women may prefer to avoid surgical treatment or may not be candidates for surgery. Vaginal pessaries are intravaginal support devices that may be controlled by the patient, reduce prolapse or incontinence, and are an alternative treatment option for women with these conditions.</p><p>This topic will review the various types of vaginal pessaries and their indications for use in gynecologic patients. Additional review of POP and stress SUI is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pessary use in obstetrics is presented elsewhere.

Clinical settings where pessary use should be considered include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient preference for nonsurgical treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of severe medical comorbidities that make the patient a poor surgical candidate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to delay surgery for several weeks or months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent POP or SUI and patient preference for avoidance of repeat surgery. However, prior prolapse surgery and prior hysterectomy are risk factors for failure to fit a pessary. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Inability to fit a pessary'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal ulcerations caused by severe POP. Reduction of POP through use of a pessary and application of vaginal estrogen cream both promote healing of the ulcers within three to six weeks, which is useful prior to surgical repair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current pregnancy, to manage POP and cervical insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desire for future childbearing. The benefit of surgical repair of POP may be nullified by subsequent pregnancy and childbirth.</p><p/><p>Pessary use in pregnant women is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-insufficiency#H2087570908\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical insufficiency&quot;, section on 'Pessary'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT ACCEPTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient acceptance of pessaries varies from 42 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>], and is related to appropriate counseling and encouragement from the provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients who decline a pessary trial are more likely to be nulliparous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], or have severe prolapse and incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was illustrated in two studies of treatment choices among women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) that reported older women were more likely than younger women to choose a pessary, whereas women with prior prolapse surgery, more severe prolapse, and more severe symptoms related to bowel emptying, sexual function, and quality of life were more likely to choose surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. Similarly, in a retrospective chart review of over 300 women with &ge; stage 2 prolapse, women age &gt;65 years were more likely to use a pessary long-term compared with women &le; age 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to pessary use are rarely encountered. Potential contraindications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local infection &ndash; Active infections of the vagina or pelvis, such as vaginitis or pelvic inflammatory disease, preclude the use of a pessary until the infection has been resolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposed foreign body &ndash; An exposed foreign body such as vaginal mesh should preclude pessary use until the exposure of the foreign body has been resolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latex sensitivity &ndash; The Inflatoball pessary is made of latex; therefore, it is contraindicated in women with latex allergies. The other pessaries discussed below are nonallergenic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncompliance &ndash; Noncompliance with follow-up could be harmful since an undetected and untreated erosion could put the patient at risk of developing a fistula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexually active women who are unable to remove and reinsert the pessary &ndash; Inability to manage the pessary around coital activity could be discouraging.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF PESSARIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pessaries come in several different shapes and sizes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>). Most are made of silicone, which is nonallergenic, durable, autoclavable, and does not retain odors. A few are made of other materials, such as latex or polycarbonate. Pessaries are designed to target symptoms of prolapse, SUI, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Support versus space filling pessaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pessaries can be classified into essentially two categories: support and space-filling. The support pessary is used to treat all stages of POP and SUI, whereas the space-filling pessary is mostly used for severe POP. Both types are held in place proximally by the uterus (or the vaginal apex following hysterectomy), laterally by the levator muscles, and distally by the pubic bone and the vaginal introitus. Space-filling pessaries and larger size pessaries are often needed for severe prolapse (stage III or IV), as vaginal capacity can increase significantly as a result of levator atrophy and an enlarged vaginal introitus can allow a support pessary to rotate and be expelled.</p><p>Surveys of gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] reported that the ring pessary (support type pessary) was the most commonly used pessary. A prospective observational study reported that most women with stage II and III prolapse (100 and 71 percent, respectively) were successfully fitted with ring pessaries, whereas women with stage IV prolapse usually required a Gellhorn pessary (space-filling pessary) (64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A randomized crossover trial compared the &quot;ring with support&quot; to Gellhorn pessary in women with stage II-IV prolapse and showed significant improvement in prolapse, urinary, and rectal symptoms with both, and no difference in symptom response between pessaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>I suggest initial use of a support pessary, rather than a space-filling pessary, because support pessaries are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More easily removed and inserted by the patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allow intercourse while in place</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are often more comfortable.</p><p/><p>I routinely use the &quot;ring with support&quot; or Gellhorn pessary, as most women with prolapse can be treated with ring sizes 3, 4, and 5 and Gellhorn sizes 2.5, 2.75, and 3 inches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and, as discussed above, they are equally effective for the treatment of prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In unusual cases of prolapse, a double pessary may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Support pessaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support pessaries are essentially two-dimensional, and sit in the long axis of the vagina. Types of support pessaries include the ring (with or without a support diaphragm), the lever, the Gehrung, the Shaatz, and the incontinence ring or dish pessaries. Most women can remove and reinsert support pessaries. Sexual intercourse is still possible when they are left in place.</p><p>Ring pessaries are the only support pessaries that I use, as use of only one type of support pessary is practical and the lever, Gehrung, and Shaatz pessaries have minimal added benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ring pessaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ring pessary, as in Letters F, G and L in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>), will fit 70 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is the most commonly used pessary, as it can treat all stages of POP, as well as SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,18</a>]. Additionally, it is comfortable, easily removed and inserted by the patient, and sexual intercourse is possible when left in place. A string may be attached to the ring to aid in removal; this string should be tucked into the vagina to avoid soiling with urine and feces. However, the ring can usually be removed easily without a string.</p><p>The &quot;ring with support' pessary has a thin diaphragm across the ring, and is especially useful for women with uterine prolapse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cystocele, but may also be used to treat rectocele and vaginal vault prolapse. Although the ring pessary is available in sizes 0 to 9, most women can be managed with sizes 3, 4, and 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The ring pessary is inserted by folding it in half like a taco, and then inserting it with the curved side up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81223\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81223 \">figure 1</a>). The ring will then open to its circular shape. The lower rim of the pessary should rest behind the pubic symphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69208\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69208 \">figure 2</a>). The ring should then be turned one-quarter turn, so that it will not easily fold onto itself and be expelled.</p><p>The 'ring without support' pessary is useful in younger women, as they have less atrophy of the levator muscles, and a more oval contour to the vagina. The absence of the support diaphragm allows this pessary to take an oval shape and conform to the shape of the vagina.</p><p>The incontinence ring pessary has a knob that is placed beneath the urethra to increase urethral pressure when treating SUI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76369\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76369 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Lever pessaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Smith, Hodge, and Risser pessaries, as in Letters A, B, C, and E in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>), are collectively referred to as lever pessaries. These devices were originally intended to treat uterine retroversion. They may be used for uterine prolapse and cystocele, and case reports have described use in pregnancies complicated by cervical insufficiency. They are no longer commonly used.</p><p>When inserting a lever pessary, the uterus is manually anteverted if it has been retrodisplaced. The pessary is then folded and inserted into the vagina. The index finger is placed against the posterior bar until it rests posterior to the cervix. The anterior bar should rest posteriorly to the pubic symphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68708 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Gehrung pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Gehrung pessary is designed to treat cystocele <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rectocele. It has a U-shaped flexible rim with a rubber diaphragm, as in Letter D in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>). When inserted properly, the two bases rest on the posterior vagina against the lateral levator muscles, and the concave surface and diaphragm support the anterior vagina. There are no studies of this pessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Shaatz pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Shaatz pessary is a rigid ring pessary, and essentially the same as the Gellhorn pessary without the stem (ie, just the base of the Gellhorn), as in Letter I in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>). It does not fold, so must be inserted vertically and then rotated to a horizontal position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Space-filling pessaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Space-filling pessaries are essentially three-dimensional, and differ from the support pessaries in that they have a large base that supports the vaginal apex (or cervix). They include the Gellhorn, donut, cube, Inflatoball, and Colpexin sphere pessaries. They are often needed in women with severe (stage III or IV) POP, especially post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse, but offer no advantage in the treatment of SUI. Space-filling pessaries are often difficult for patients to remove, and sexual intercourse is not possible when they are in place. To simplify office management, I mostly use the flexible Gellhorn pessaries, but occasionally use the other space-filling pessaries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Gellhorn pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Gellhorn pessary has a broad, firm, circular base with a stem protruding from the center, as in Letter K in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>). The broad base provides support to the vaginal apex, and the stem sits on the long axis of the vagina. The stem keeps the circular base from rotating into the long axis of the vagina and being expelled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54046 \">figure 5</a>). The base is slightly concave, allowing suction to form against the vagina, which helps hold the pessary in place, but can make it difficult to remove manually. There are small holes in the base to allow drainage, as well as a hole in the stem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81272\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81272 \">picture 2</a>). The Gellhorn sizes reflect the diameter of the base and are available in 1.5 to 3.5 inch sizes, in one-quarter-inch increments. Most women can be managed with the 2.5, 2.75, and 3-inch sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The Gellhorn pessary is inserted by first holding the stem and partially folding one side of the base up to the stem, so that the base of the pessary is vertical and at a 90-degree angle to the introitus. (Folding the base up to the stem gives the Gellhorn more of a two-dimensional shape). A finger from the opposite hand separates the introitus and depresses the perineal body. The leading edge of the base is placed into the vagina until it reaches the apex, then rotated so that the base supports the apex and the stem is in the long axis of the vagina.</p><p>A Kelly clamp can be used to grasp the stem to assist with removal (one jaw of the clamp is inserted into the hole and the other jaw grasps the outside of the stem). The flexible Gellhorn is better than the rigid Gellhorn, as placement is easier. A string may be attached to the stem to aid in removal. This string should be tucked into the vagina to avoid soiling with urine and feces.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Donut pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The donut pessary is similar to a ring pessary, but the ring is thick and hollow, as in Letter N in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>). The thick, hollow ring fills the larger space associated with advanced prolapse and levator atrophy. The donut pessary is available in diameter sizes similar to the Gellhorn, ranging from 1- to 3-inch sizes, in one-quarter-inch increments. Most women needing a donut pessary can be treated with the 2.5, 2.75, and 3-inch sizes.</p><p>The donut pessary is inserted by holding it vertically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61016\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61016 \">figure 6</a>) and then rotating it to a horizontal position during placement. A Kelly clamp may be required for pessary removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Cube pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cube pessary has six concave sides, as in Letter H in the first picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65730\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65730 \">picture 3</a>), which allow the cube to hold the vaginal walls with suction, thereby preventing prolapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81498\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81498 \">figure 7</a>). Although the cube is highly effective in correcting prolapse, the risk of a neglected cube pessary is high because even short-term use is associated with vaginal erosions. In addition, this pessary is associated with a profound malodorous discharge. To minimize occurrence of these problems, the cube pessary should be removed nightly, cleaned, and not reinserted until the next morning. Despite routine removal and cleaning as described, at least one woman has developed a rectovaginal fistula from a cube pessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The cube pessary is inserted by squeezing the flexible rubber sides together and then placing the device at the vaginal apex. It is available in sizes 0 to 7, with diameters ranging from 1 to 2.25 inches. Again, a string may be attached to aid in removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflatable pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Inflatoball pessary was designed to facilitate removal and insertion by the patient, as in Letter M in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>). It has an air-filled ball and a stem with a port; a bulb is attached to the port to inflate or deflate the pessary, which makes the device less bulky during insertion and removal. However, the stem protrudes from the vagina and may cause unacceptable discomfort. Additionally, the pessary is made of latex, not silicone, so it cannot be used in women with latex allergy or sensitivity.</p><p>The Inflatoball is placed in a similar manner as the donut pessary. The bulb is then attached, a ball-bearing within the stem is moved to a lateral projection on the side of the stem, the pessary is inflated, the ball-bearing is moved back into position to keep the pessary inflated, and the bulb is removed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69101\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69101 \">figure 8</a>). The Inflatoball pessary is available in diameter sizes of 2 to 2.75 inches, in one-quarter-inch increments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Spherical pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Colpexin Sphere (Adamed, Warsaw, Poland) is a newer pessary designed to make removal and insertion easier, improve comfort (because of its smaller size and spherical shape), and allow the patient to perform concomitant pelvic floor muscle exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69336 \">figure 9</a>). It is made of polycarbonate, with an attached braided nylon string for ease of removal, and is available in six sizes, from 28 mm to 44 mm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Incontinence pessaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few pessaries designed specifically for SUI. They include incontinence ring and incontinence dish pessaries, the Uresta incontinence pessary, the Contiform intravaginal device, the Cook Continence Ring, the Introl bladder neck support prosthesis, and the ConTIPI disposable intravaginal device.</p><p>When fitted properly, an incontinence pessary compresses the urethra against the upper posterior portion of the symphysis pubis, causing an increase in urethral resistance that prevents leakage associated with sudden increases in abdominal pressure (ie, cough or Valsalva).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Incontinence ring and dish</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incontinence ring pessary, as in Letter L in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252 \">picture 1</a>), has a knob that is placed beneath the urethra to increase urethral pressure to treat stress incontinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76369\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76369 \">figure 3</a>). The incontinence dish is more rigid and shaped like a dish, but has minimal added benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Bell-shaped incontinence pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Uresta incontinence pessary is a bell-shaped pessary with a handle at its base for easy removal and insertion. It has a narrow, rounded tip that allows easy insertion into the vaginal introitus. When properly positioned, the wide base supports the urethra. It is made of a medical grade rubber that has been extensively tested for biocompatibility and safety, and available in sizes 3, 4, and 5 (small, medium, and large).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Cylindrical intravaginal device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Contiform intravaginal device is shaped like a large, hollow tampon made of Santoprene, a nonallergenic thermoplastic rubber. The device sits behind the pubic bone and supports the urethra during episodes of increased intraabdominal pressure. Its tampon-like shape was partly designed to facilitate <span class=\"nowrap\">self-insertion/removal</span> by patients.

It is a flexible ring pessary with an inflatable balloon that lies under the urethrovesical junction. The balloon obstructs the flow of urine during rest and episodes of physical stress. When the patient experiences an urge to void, or when a specified time interval on a voiding schedule has passed, the balloon is deflated to allow voiding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Disposable intravaginal device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ConTIPI disposable intravaginal device is made of a flexible resin core with a cover made of soft nylon mesh, which provides support to the urethra whenever abdominal pressure is transferred to the pelvic floor. The device is inserted with an applicator, similar to a tampon, and a cotton string is attached to the mesh cover for removal. Among 60 women with severe SUI, 85 percent were markedly improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">PESSARY FITTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Fitting the pessary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women to be fitted for a pessary are first examined with an empty bladder in the dorsal lithotomy position. Postvoid urine residual is assessed and urine is sent for urinalysis. A split speculum exam using the pelvic organ prolapse quantitation system (POP-Q) is used to stage the prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and assess vaginal atrophy. Pelvic floor muscle strength (Kegel squeeze) is also evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vaginal introitus size, vaginal length, and prolapse stage are used to guide selection of pessary type and size. However, pessary fitting is mostly a trial and error process, and several pessaries may be needed to obtain an adequate fit At least one trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-and-prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine-prilocaine</a> cream pretreatment with placebo reported reduced pain with pessary removal in the lidocaine-prilocaine group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, use of topical analgesia may facilitate pessary fitting. Ultimately, the largest pessary that is comfortable is prescribed. </p><p>The type of pessary likely to be needed is determined by measuring prolapse stage and the size of the vaginal introitus, the latter is gauged by the number of fingerbreadths accommodated across the posterior fourchette (this is typically 1 to 4 fingers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If the vaginal introitus size is 1 to 2 fingerbreadths and the prolapse stage is II-III, a ring pessary is likely to be successful, whereas with a 3 to 4 fingerbreadth introitus or stage IV prolapse, a Gellhorn pessary is more likely to be successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Next, the size of the pessary that will be needed is estimated by inserting two fingers to measure the width and length of the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74477\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74477 \">figure 10</a>). It is important to get an overall estimate of the vaginal length and vaginal width together. If the vaginal length has been shortened by a prior hysterectomy, or if the vaginal width has been narrowed by a prior prolapse surgery, then only smaller size pessaries will fit.</p><p>Pessaries are inserted into the vagina with the dominant hand, while the nondominant hand separates the introitus and depresses the perineal body. A nonlubricated glove is used, and a small amount of lubricant is applied to the leading edge of the pessary; if too much lubricant is used, the pessary will be too slippery to control. After the pessary is inserted into the vagina, the woman is asked to strain and cough repeatedly on the examination table, ambulate in the office, and void and strain while sitting on a toilet. This &quot;office trial&quot; helps determine if she will be able to retain the pessary and void when she returns home, and if bothersome urinary incontinence will develop. She should have a negative cough stress test following pessary placement, as she is unlikely to be satisfied if there are significant stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptoms.</p><p>Women should be reassured that it is not an emergency if the pessary is expelled; they should just bring the pessary back to the office and a different type or size of pessary will likely be effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A follow-up visit is scheduled one to two weeks later. The patient is asked if there were any side effects, such as discomfort, expulsion, persistent bulge or pressure symptoms, persistent or de novo stress or urgency urinary incontinence, difficulty with urination or bowel movements, or vaginal bleeding or discharge.</p><p>The pessary is removed and cleaned with soap and water, and the vagina is examined for erosions. If the pessary fits well and there were no side effects, motivated and able patients are taught how to remove, clean, and reinsert their pessary. The pessary should be removed, cleaned, and left out overnight every one to two weeks; it should also be removed before sexual intercourse. The patient should be seen for second follow-up visit in one to two months, and every 12 months thereafter. </p><p>If the patient cannot, or chooses not, to remove and reinsert her pessary, then she should return for follow-up in one to two months, and every three to six months thereafter for pessary cleaning and assessment by the clinician. A survey of 555 clinicians that use pessaries in the United Kingdom reported that 23 percent changed their patients&rsquo; pessaries every three to six months, 67 percent every six months, and 10 percent every 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Pain with insertion and removal of the pessary is a problem for some women, and one study showed that 4 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-and-prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine-prilocaine</a> cream applied 5 minutes before pessary change reduced patient-reported pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In our practice, we offer most women low-dose estrogen vaginal cream (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjugated-equine-estrogens-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">conjugated equine estrogens</a> cream [CEE] 0.25 to 0.5 g, two to three nights per week) to treat co-existing vaginal atrophy and dryness from estrogen deficiency.</p><p>In some women, the width of the introitus may decrease in size after several weeks of pessary use. In such women, a new smaller size pessary is prescribed to allow for easier removal and insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common side effects of pessary use include vaginal erosions and discharge. Vaginal erosions are reported in 3 to 24 percent of women using pessaries (weighted mean 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9,11,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,28,29</a>]. Vaginal bleeding and irritative symptoms can be symptoms of an erosion. Other common side effects include de novo (occult) stress urinary incontinence, interference with sexual intercourse, and difficulty with bowel movements. Urinary tract infections have been reported in up to 13 percent of pessary users and bacterial vaginosis in up to 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/11,28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28,30,31</a>]. </p><p>Vaginal discharge is very common in pessary users and has typically been attributed to a change in bacterial flora that results from the postmenopausal rise in vaginal pH; the pessary itself may incite an inflammatory response. In one study of 100 postmenopausal women, the prevalence of bothersome vaginal discharge in those who used and did not use pessaries was 30 and 2 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, while the women using pessaries had more microscopic evidence of inflammation and vaginitis on Gram stain, the vaginal cultures of the two groups had nearly identical aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The cause of the inflammatory response appeared to be the pessary and not a change in vaginal microbiota. A similar study also reported no difference with regard to the type of vaginal flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>If bothersome side effects occur, the main treatment options are refitting the patient with a different size or type of pessary or medical therapy. For women with vaginal atrophy, we typically treat with vaginal estrogen. One study reported that women who used estrogen were more likely to continue pessary use and less likely to experience increased vaginal discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. For women with vaginal discharge, a pH lowering product (eg, Trimo-San gel) may be used alone or in combination with vaginal estrogen, although the clinical impact is unclear. One trial of women using pessary for POP showed that use of Triomo-San cream (versus no treatment) had no effect on the outcome of bacterial vaginosis, and had no impact on continued use of the pessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. If the symptoms persist, the woman may need to stop pessary use temporarily. Women with symptoms that do not respond to pessary change or medical treatment may consider surgical treatment for prolapse or stress incontinence. Treatment of vaginal atrophy is reviewed in detail separately.

In one study of 160 women with stage 2 or greater symptomatic POP, women electing either surgery or pessary use reported improvement in symptom goals (prolapse, urinary, bowel, pain) and function goals (physical, social, emotional, sexual) at 12 months of follow-up, although surgery was associated with greater improvements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A smaller study of 106 women also reported improvement in prolapse and urinary scales with pessary use (but not in colorectal scales), while women in the surgery group reported improvement in all three domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, the women who underwent surgery reported greater improvement in the prolapse and urinary domains. Lastly, a different study of nearly 270 women with symptomatic prolapse comparing pessary use with surgical correction reported equal improvements in both groups at 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p>While it appears that correction of POP with a vaginal pessary restores anatomy and improves many of the associated urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction symptoms, it is not clear if women are satisfied with a pessary as a long-term solution. A prospective observational study of 187 women from the United Kingdom reported that 86 percent of women continued with a pessary over five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], whereas a retrospective study of 167 women from Australia reported the pessary continuation rate dropped to 14 percent over 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. It is unknown if longer duration of pessary use leads to a greater likelihood to pursue surgical treatment. The small sample size, different populations, and different study designs limit the interpretation of these results. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for discontinuing pessary use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for discontinuing pessary use in women with a successful pessary fitting trial for POP include: severe posterior vaginal prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/43,50,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,50,60</a>], development of occult SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], and desire for surgery at first visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Three studies recommended treatment of vaginal atrophy or erosions with more frequent use of estrogen cream (nightly), and weekly follow-up until the vagina healed, rather than excluding women with hypoestrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/9,11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of urinary incontinence trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action of vaginal pessaries for urinary incontinence is related to improved urethral function. Urodynamic studies of women treated with a pessary for SUI have shown increases in functional urethral length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>] and urethral closure pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>], absence of urethral obstruction to flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], and resolution of detrusor instability in women with severe prolapse and detrusor instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Anatomically, pessaries improve urethral support, as there is a reduction in the straining Q-tip angle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging studies show a decreased posterior urethrovesical angle, elevation of the bladder neck, and increased urethral lengths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Treatment of stress incontinence with a pessary appears to be less successful than pelvic floor muscle training during the first few months of therapy; however, long-term use of either strategy is associated with similar outcomes. The highest quality data regarding this issue are from the Ambulatory Treatment for Leakage Associated with Stress Incontinence (ATLAS) randomized trial of 446 women with stress incontinence who were assigned to one of three treatment groups: continence pessary; behavioral therapy (pelvic floor muscle training and other strategies); or combined use of a pessary and behavioral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. At three months, significantly fewer women in the pessary versus behavioral or combined groups reported a complete absence of bothersome incontinence symptoms (pessary: 33 percent; behavioral: 49 percent; combined: 44 percent) and treatment satisfaction (63; 75; 79 percent); these outcomes did not differ significantly between the behavioral and combined groups. At 12 months, there were no significant differences among the pessary, behavioral, and combined groups in the proportion of women who reported an absence of incontinence symptoms (35; 40; 33 percent) or patient satisfaction (50; 54; 54 percent).</p><p>In a secondary study from the ATLAS trial above, among women successfully treated for SUI, improvement in continence during sexual activity was greater in the behavioral and combined groups than in the pessary group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In a different planned secondary analysis of the ATLAS trial, predictors of success and satisfaction with nonsurgical management (all types) included postmenopausal status, higher education, no previous urinary incontinence surgery, and lower incontinence frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. This information may help providers in counseling patients regarding nonsurgical treatment outcomes. </p><p>Observational studies have reported short-term efficacy (one month or less) of pessaries for stress and mixed urinary incontinence, with improvements in pad testing, bladder diaries, and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/60,77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,77-79</a>].

Medium-term (6 to 13 months) satisfaction and continued use was 59 percent (range 39 to 76 percent) for women with a successful pessary fitting trial, and 43 percent (range 16 to 59 percent) by intention-to-treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/10,36,37,47,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,36,37,47,71</a>].</p><p>In the ATLAS trial described above, women discontinued treatment in both the pessary and behavioral groups at similar rates at both three months (18 and 15 percent) and 12 months (27 and 32 percent); these rates exclude women who withdrew from the pessary group due to a failed pessary fitting.</p><p>Other studies have reported that most women who chose not to continue using a pessary discontinued use within one to two months. The most common reasons given were persistent incontinence, resolution of incontinence with pelvic floor muscle exercises, and pessary discomfort or expulsion. Prior incontinence surgery was a risk factor for discontinued pessary use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/36,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,47</a>].</p><p>Continence pessaries or pelvic floor muscle training are typically used for women with stress incontinence who decline or are not candidates for more effective surgical treatments. Pelvic muscle floor training requires more time for a patient than pessary use. In contrast, exercises have no associated adverse effects, while pessary use may be accompanied by vaginal erosions and malodorous vaginal discharge. Given these clinical considerations and the ATLAS trial data, we suggest pelvic floor muscle training rather than continence pessary use for women with stress urinary incontinence who do not otherwise have a preference for one of these nonsurgical modalities and in women whose incontinence interferes with sexual function.

A pessary placed during urodynamic evaluation of women with POP can diagnose occult (potential) SUI and predict whether anti-incontinence surgery will be therapeutic.

Among those with a positive pessary test for occult SUI, postoperative SUI occurred in 41 to 65 percent of women who did not undergo a mid-urethral sling procedure at the time of prolapse surgery, but in only 9 to 11 percent of those who did undergo a mid-urethral sling. By comparison, <span class=\"nowrap\">0/30</span> women with a negative pessary test developed symptomatic SUI postoperatively. These observations are similar to those from another study which reported a 64 percent rate of postoperative SUI when prolapse surgery alone was performed in women with occult SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts (CARE) trial randomized women with severe prolapse and absence of SUI to undergo abdominal sacrocolpopexy with or without concomitant Burch colposuspension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].
