It supplies cutaneous and muscular innervation to the upper extremity, with the exception of the trapezius muscle, the cape of the shoulder, and a small area of skin near the axilla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75388\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75388 \">figure 3</a>). The superficial cervical plexus supplies cutaneous innervation over the clavicle, the cape of the shoulder, and the first two anterior intercostal spaces (supraclavicular nerves, C3 and C4).</p><p>The nerve roots emerge in the neck adjacent to the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae and posterior to the vertebral artery. The nerve roots continue as the trunks of the brachial plexus (superior [C5,C6], middle [C7], inferior [C8,T1]) and pass between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. At this point, the phrenic nerve is located anterior to the anterior scalene muscle. Each trunk divides into an anterior and posterior division, which in turn correspond to the ventral and dorsal upper extremities, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>All three trunks pass over the first rib and continue deep to the clavicle. The cords of the brachial plexus form from the trunks just distal to the first rib and are named according to their position relative to the axillary artery (lateral, posterior, and medial). The cords give rise to the five major nerves of the upper extremity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Musculocutaneous nerve</strong> (from lateral cord) &ndash; The musculocutaneous nerve passes between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles to the lateral side of the upper arm, continuing to the forearm. It innervates the flexor muscles of the upper arm (biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, and brachialis) and provides sensation to the lateral forearm (lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Axillary nerve</strong> (from posterior cord) &ndash; The axillary nerve supplies the skin of the shoulder and upper arm, shoulder joint, deltoid, and teres minor muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radial nerve</strong> (from posterior cord) &ndash; The radial nerve continues posterior to the axillary artery then winds around the humerus, providing branches to the extensor muscles of the upper arm. After passing anterior to the lateral epicondyle of the elbow, it continues into the forearm to supply the extensor muscles of the forearm and hand. Sensory branches supply the dorsum of the forearm and hand, as well as portions of the upper arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Median nerve</strong> (from lateral and medial cords) &ndash; The median nerve continues along the posterior and lateral surface of the axillary artery and then courses medial to the brachial artery. It travels between and innervates the forearm flexor muscles, then passes through the carpal tunnel, providing motor and sensory function to the hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ulnar nerve</strong> (from medial cord) &ndash; The ulnar nerve runs along the medial upper arm initially adjacent to the brachial artery, diverging in the distal upper arm to pass posterior to the medial epicondyle of the elbow into the forearm along the ulna, where it branches to supply some of the forearm flexors. It joins the ulnar artery, traversing the wrist deep to the flexor carpi ulnaris and into the hand, providing motor and sensory function to the hand.</p><p/><p>The intercostobrachial nerve (T2) is a lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve and is not part of the brachial plexus. It leaves the second intercostal space in the midaxillary line, pierces the serratus anterior muscle, and enters the subcutaneous tissue of the axilla. This nerve, along with the medical cutaneous nerve of the arm (a branch of the ulnar nerve), provides sensory innervation of the axilla and the medial aspect of the upper arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75388\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75388 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320231953\"><span class=\"h1\">BRACHIAL PLEXUS BLOCKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The brachial plexus can be blocked at several levels: in the neck using an interscalene block, above the clavicle with a supraclavicular block, below the clavicle with an infraclavicular block, or in the axilla with an axillary block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1413149736\"><span class=\"h2\">Interscalene block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interscalene block is used for surgery of the shoulder and proximal upper extremity. It anesthetizes the C5 through C7 nerve roots as well as the superficial cervical plexus (C3 and C4, including the supraclavicular nerve). Depending on the volume of local anesthetic injected, the roots of C8 and T1, which form the lower trunk, are often not blocked, so the interscalene block may not provide analgesia for medial (ulnar distribution) hand surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21164856\"><span class=\"h3\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For interscalene block, the patient is placed in a supine position, with the head turned away from the side of the block. The sternal notch, the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the clavicle are identified. The anterior and middle scalene muscles lie posterior to the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51630 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H790721004\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound-guided interscalene block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With an ultrasound-guided technique, the transducer is placed in a transverse position, with its long axis parallel to and just above the clavicle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103968\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103968 \">picture 1</a>). The subclavian artery is identified by directing the beam of the transducer toward the first rib. The brachial plexus appears as a &quot;bundle of grapes&quot; lateral to the subclavian artery and overlying the first rib (at the level of the trunks).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The brachial plexus is traced cephalad, with the transducer maintained in a horizontal (axial) position. At the C6 level, the nerve roots of the brachial plexus are visualized in a vertical orientation within the interscalene groove (ie, between the anterior and middle scalene muscles) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80984\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80984 \">image 1</a>). The needle is inserted either in-plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97801 \">picture 2</a>) or out-of-plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97800 \">picture 3</a>) and directed toward these nerves. We use an in-plane approach with needle trajectory from lateral to medial, although the plexus can be approached starting medial to the transducer and aiming lateral. The needle tip is placed adjacent to the nerve roots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103969\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103969 \">image 2</a>), and local anesthetic (LA) spread should be visualized surrounding them. After negative aspiration for blood, a total of 12 to 30 mL of LA is injected, in 5-mL increments, with gentle aspiration in-between injections, stopping if the patient experiences pain or paresthesia during injection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448299901\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve stimulator-guided interscalene block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a nerve stimulator is used, the groove between the anterior and middle scalene muscles is identified, and the needle is inserted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51630 \">figure 4</a>) perpendicular to the skin with a slightly caudad and posterior orientation, while observing for twitches of the deltoid, biceps, triceps, or pectoralis major muscles. Once twitches are observed at 1 mA, the stimulation intensity is reduced; twitch should be maintained at 0.4 mA but abolished at lower stimulus intensity in order to avoid intraneural injection. Successful anesthesia is often achieved regardless of the level of motor stimulation evoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks#H184103855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;, section on 'Technique for nerve stimulator guidance'</a>.)</p><p>After negative aspiration, up to 20 to 30 mL of LA is injected in 5-mL increments, with negative aspiration in-between. If paresthesia or pain occurs, the injection is stopped, and needle position can be reevaluated prior to further injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;, section on 'Nerve stimulator guidance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959817492\"><span class=\"h3\">Perineural catheter interscalene block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indwelling perineural catheters may be placed for prolonged postoperative analgesia. The technique for placing catheters is the same as for single-shot injections, using ultrasound guidance or nerve stimulation.</p><p>A 17- to 19-gauge Tuohy needle is placed, rather than a block needle. After injecting either LA or saline through the needle, a 20- or 19-gauge single- or multi-orifice catheter is threaded far enough past the needle tip to allow the catheter perforations to bathe the desired nerve(s).</p><p>Alternatively, catheter-over-needle kits are available for perineural catheter placement using ultrasound guidance, nerve stimulation, or both. The technique for placement is the same, but the catheter slides over the end of the needle, similar to intravenous (IV) catheter placement. Leak around the catheter may be less with catheter-over-needle equipment.</p><p>Some anesthesiologists prefer to perform the nerve block via the catheter instead of via the needle in order to confirm proper placement of the catheter tip. This is particularly important when a nerve stimulator technique is used. When ultrasound guidance is used, after removal of the needle, the location of the catheter can be confirmed by visualization of the catheter and spread of LA. We inject several mL of LA through the needle under ultrasound guidance to confirm placement, and inject the rest of the bolus through the catheter, while visualizing spread of LA. It is important to observe local anesthetic spread through the catheter to rule out epidural or intrathecal catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The catheter is secured to the skin with a sterile dressing after applying sterile surgical glue.</p><p>Continuous infusion of LA is administered at 5 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> postoperatively. Our practice is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For ambulatory patients, a continuous infusion of 0.2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> is used, and the patient receives a comprehensive instruction sheet that includes the signs and symptoms of LA toxicity, pump maintenance information, and the acute pain service phone number prior to discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For inpatients, 0.1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> is administered; others use 0.2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234061557\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects and complications of interscalene block</span></p><p>Interscalene block using typical volumes of LA results in 100% incidence of phrenic nerve block and resultant hemidiaphragmatic paralysis by blocking the phrenic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Phrenic block is associated with an approximately 25 to 30 percent reduction in FEV1 percent and FVC percent (and possibly more in obese patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and may not be tolerated by patients with limited pulmonary reserve. The use of a lower volume of LA may reduce the incidence of phrenic nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], but the quality and distribution of the block may suffer, and phrenic palsy cannot be predictably avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H144231109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Peripheral nerve blocks'</a>.)</p><p>Other self-limited side effects of interscalene block also relate to spread of LA to surrounding neural tissue, including Horner syndrome from block of the sympathetic trunk, and hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal nerve block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These side effects usually resolve as the block wears off. Rarely, epidural [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and total spinal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] anesthesia have been reported with interscalene block.</p><p>Pneumothorax is possible but less likely than it is with supraclavicular block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks have a lower incidence of these complications compared with the supraclavicular approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>Traditional paresthesia techniques in the placement of brachial plexus blocks are associated with a higher risk of pneumothorax (0.5 to 6 percent), especially in thin patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1413149742\"><span class=\"h2\">Supraclavicular block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The supraclavicular approach blocks the brachial plexus at the level of the nerve trunks (upper, middle, and lower), where the nerves are packed closely together. Supraclavicular block provides a reliable, rapid onset and dense block for surgery of the distal two-thirds of the upper extremity, including those surgeries requiring an upper extremity tourniquet (eg, hand surgery).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21164873\"><span class=\"h3\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For supraclavicular block, the patient is placed in the supine position, with the arms by the sides and the head turned away from the side of the block. Most practitioners prefer the head of the bed elevated approximately 30 degrees.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H790721214\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the use of ultrasound guidance whenever a supraclavicular block is performed in order to minimize the chance of vascular puncture and pneumothorax. The ultrasound transducer is placed in a transverse position parallel to and just above the clavicle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60915\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60915 \">figure 5</a>). The subclavian artery is identified by moving the transducer medially along the clavicle and directing the transducer toward the first rib. The brachial plexus at the level of the trunks and divisions appears as a &quot;bundle of grapes&quot; lateral to the subclavian artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60915\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60915 \">figure 5</a>). The lateral end of the transducer is often rotated slightly cephalad to visualize the brachial plexus in a more short-axis plane (perpendicular to its path). The needle is inserted in-plane from lateral to medial (parallel to the probe), with the target being the junction of the subclavian artery, brachial plexus, and first rib (&ldquo;corner pocket&rdquo;) and LA is injected to lift the brachial plexus off the first rib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Twenty to 30 mL of LA is injected, after negative aspiration for blood, in 5-mL increments, while looking for spread around the nerves. Most practitioners prefer a two-injection technique, with 15 mL of LA deposited at the &ldquo;corner pocket&rdquo; and 15 mL deposited more superficially between trunks of the plexus or above the plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Injection should be stopped if the patient experiences pain or paresthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96273725\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve stimulator-guided supraclavicular block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve stimulation can be used in addition to ultrasound guidance as secondary confirmation that the needle tip is not placed intraneurally. Once the needle is positioned using ultrasound guidance, and prior to injection of LA, the nerve stimulator is connected. Contraction of the muscles of the arm, forearm, or wrist with stimulus below 0.4 mA suggests an intraneural needle position and warrants needle withdrawal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> redirection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

It is often easier to pass the catheter using a medial-to-lateral needle insertion. Infraclavicular block is preferred for perineural catheter placement, because it may provide better stabilization of the catheter and easier catheter care than supraclavicular placement, and may provide superior analgesia. (See <a href=\"#H959817492\" class=\"local\">'Perineural catheter interscalene block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H959817595\" class=\"local\">'Perineural catheter infraclavicular block'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234061564\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects and complications of supraclavicular block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothorax is a significant potential complication of supraclavicular block. The incidence of pneumothorax is as high as 6 percent when a paresthesia technique is used for localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A number of techniques have been used to reduce the incidence of pneumothorax with this block, including various needle orientations, as well as the use of ultrasound with and without nerve stimulator confirmation, with no major complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/17,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-23</a>]. In this setting, vigilance should extend into the immediate postoperative period, as pneumothorax, though rare, can present with immediate or delayed symptoms. We suggest the use of ultrasound guidance for supraclavicular block, with constant visualization of the needle tip, first rib, and pleura throughout the procedure.</p><p>Self-limited side effects of supraclavicular block placement can include hoarseness due to temporary blockade of the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cervical sympathetic block, Horner syndrome from block of the stellate ganglion, and hemidiaphragmatic paresis (50 to 67 percent) from phrenic nerve block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/11,12,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,24-27</a>]. These side effects generally resolve as the block wears off. Ultrasound guidance improves the speed and quality of block placement and reduces the incidence of side effects and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/11,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1413149748\"><span class=\"h2\">Infraclavicular block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infraclavicular approach is a block of the brachial plexus at the level of the cords (lateral, posterior, and medial). Like the supraclavicular block, it provides anesthesia for surgeries of the distal two-thirds of the arm and consistently blocks the axillary and musculocutaneous nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Compared with supraclavicular blocks, this approach is more often used for placement of indwelling catheters since the infraclavicular site provides stable positioning and easier catheter care.

The needle is placed in-plane with the transducer in a cephalad to caudal trajectory. With constant needle visualization, the needle is advanced cephalad to the axillary artery and lateral cord, until it is positioned deep to the axillary artery, adjacent to the posterior cord. After negative aspiration, 30 to 40 mL of LA is administered. Some practitioners inject only one-half to two-thirds of the injectate here and deposit the remainder adjacent to the medial and then lateral cords. A successful block is ensured with spread of LA seen spreading in a &ldquo;U&rdquo; shape around the axillary artery (cephalad, deep, and caudal to the artery). Studies that defined the anatomic location of the cords using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown equal success using either single-shot infraclavicular injection or multiple-injection techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344964030\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve stimulator-guided infraclavicular block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The needle is inserted vertically in a location 2 cm medial and 2 cm caudad to the tip of the coracoid process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F115386\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115386 \">figure 7</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H790721004\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound-guided interscalene block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H790721214\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H790721312\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H344964181\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound-guided axillary block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A perineural catheter may be placed for continuous infusion of local anesthetic (LA) for postoperative pain.

The technique involves placement of an IV catheter in the hand, exsanguination of the arm using an Esmarch bandage, inflation of a tourniquet, and then injection of local anesthetic through the IV catheter.
