Coca's unique chemical properties have led to its use in social, religious, and medicinal settings for centuries.</p><p>Cocaine was first isolated from coca leaves in 1859. Over the following sixty years, many over-the-counter products containing cocaine were marketed, including asthma remedies and &quot;French Wine Cola,&quot; the predecessor of Coca-Cola. While a &quot;pinch of coca leaves&quot; was included in John Styth Pemberton's original 1886 recipe for Coca-Cola, the company began using decocainized leaves in 1906 when the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed. The first cocaine-related fatalities were reported in 1893, and in 1914 the Harrison Narcotic Act banned the nonprescription use of cocaine-containing products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Cocaine is a widely abused substance around the world. Toxicity in a variety of organs has been reported, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pulmonary sequelae that result from cocaine abuse will be reviewed here. Other aspects of cocaine abuse are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the cardiovascular complications of cocaine abuse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine use disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, medical consequences, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The local anesthetic properties of cocaine derive from its ability to stabilize cell membranes and block neuronal sodium channels. It also has potent sympathomimetic and central nervous system stimulant effects due to interference with the reuptake of catecholamines and serotonin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cocaine hydrochloride is a heat-labile fine white powder that can be inhaled nasally (&quot;snorted&quot;) or injected intravenously but cannot be smoked. However, when boiled with baking soda and water and the resultant precipitate filtered or extracted with ether or alcohol, cocaine yields a lipid-soluble, heat-stable, free-base form that can be smoked (&quot;free basing&quot;). This form is commonly called &quot;rock&quot; (because of its gross appearance) or &quot;crack&quot; (because of the characteristic crackling sound it makes when heated and smoked) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Crack cocaine may be smoked by itself through a pipe, or it may be mixed with marijuana or tobacco in cigarettes. It is rapidly absorbed through the pulmonary circulation and reaches the central nervous system within seconds. Its half-life in the blood is 60 to 90 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An autopsy series that examined lung histopathology among 52 cocaine users found that the findings were similar regardless of the route of cocaine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Histopathologic changes included lung congestion (88 percent), intraalveolar edema (77 percent), acute hemorrhage (58 percent), chronic hemorrhage (40 percent), and interstitial pneumonitis (38 percent). A high resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) study of the lungs of patients with a history of cocaine use demonstrated a number of architectural changes, including ground-glass opacities, consolidations, paraseptal emphysema, and centrilobular nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Mechanisms of cocaine-induced pulmonary injury include thermal airway injury, direct cellular toxicity, provocation of inflammatory damage (eg, eosinophilia, diffuse alveolar damage), barotrauma, and vasospasm leading to ischemia. Profound pulmonary arterial vasospasm can cause ventilation-perfusion lung scan abnormalities consistent with pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Because many cocaine abusers also smoke marijuana or tobacco, it is difficult to determine whether some physiologic alterations (eg, decreased diffusing capacity) or pathologic changes (eg, chronic inflammation) are specifically caused by cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Although smoking crack cocaine accounts for most cases of pulmonary toxicity, intravenous use, snorting, and &quot;body packing&quot; (the practice among smugglers of swallowing packets of cocaine to facilitate transport) have also resulted in lung damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute pulmonary toxicity and crack lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Crack lung&quot; refers to a syndrome of diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhagic alveolitis that occurs within 48 hours of smoking crack cocaine. This presentation is associated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or occasionally eosinophilia on bronchoscopy, and diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation in biopsy or autopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The roles of particulates, nitric oxide generation, and bronchial artery constriction in the acute lung injury are not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of acute cocaine intoxication is discussed separately.

In a case report, onset of an eosinophilic pleural effusion and pulmonary eosinophilia developed a few days after the second use of crack cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The mechanism by which cocaine induces pulmonary eosinophilia is not known, although cigarette smoking also appears to be a risk factor for acute eosinophilic pneumonia.

Smoking partners also exhale forcefully into each other's mouths to increase uptake of the drug. These practices may lead to barotrauma followed by the development of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumopericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term cocaine use is associated with a variety of histopathologic changes in the lung, including foreign body granulomatosis, bronchiectasis, and recurrent alveolar hemorrhage with hemosiderosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/9,11,15,22-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,15,22-32</a>]. Recurrent alveolar hemorrhage from prolonged crack cocaine use has been associated with development of severe pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is speculated that these pathologic manifestations of chronic cocaine use result from direct cellular toxicity, thermal airway injury, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an inflammatory or hypersensitivity response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants#H2963368663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;, section on 'Subsequent care'</a>.) </p><p>Foreign body granulomatosis is caused by inhaled or intravenous exposure to excipients such as talc (silica), cellulose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, and cotton fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>]. The consequences of foreign body granulomatosis include hilar adenopathy, chronic interstitial lung disease, tissue infarction due to pulmonary vascular impingement by embolized material or perivascular granulomas, and bullous emphysema. Systemic toxicity, such as vasculopathy and agranulocytosis, has also been reported in cases where cocaine has been adulterated with the antihelminthic agent levamisole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The pathophysiology of foreign body granulomatosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foreign-body-granulomatosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Foreign body granulomatosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>A few cases of organizing pneumonia (previously known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) have been described among cocaine users, but the mechanism by which cocaine might incite this type of inflammation is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/22,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,36</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-group-1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary hypertension is thought to be one of the consequences of foreign body granulomatosis, due to vascular occlusion from embolized adulterant material (eg, talc, silica, cellulose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>) or vascular impingement by perivascular granulomata. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foreign-body-granulomatosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Foreign body granulomatosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>It is thought that chronic cocaine use may also lead to pulmonary hypertension through vasoconstrictive effects on the pulmonary circulation, similar to those on the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the evidence for this is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. In a small number of cases, pulmonary arterial hypertension has developed in cocaine users without other clear cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In one autopsy study of 20 cocaine users, four patients had pulmonary artery medial hypertrophy of small or medium sized arteries in the absence of foreign particle microembolization or evidence of thromboembolic disease; three used intravenous injection and one oral inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In contrast, a separate autopsy series of 28 cocaine users found no pathologic findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension, although three had evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism and one of pulmonary infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Moreover, in a case series of 10 habitual crack cocaine smokers, intravenous cocaine administration did not increase pulmonary artery pressures or pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, it appears that a small number of cocaine users develop pulmonary hypertension. However, data are insufficient to identify which individuals are at risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant portion of individuals who smoke crack develop nonspecific respiratory complaints. A survey of public health center walk-in patients who admitted to having smoked crack in the previous 30 days revealed that 95 percent had at least one respiratory symptom in the previous week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, cocaine use can lead to both acute and more slowly developing serious respiratory symptoms, depending on the route of use and the presence of underlying respiratory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/15,24,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,44,45</a>].</p><p>Smoking crack cocaine can result in the acute onset of shortness of breath and cough within 48 hours of crack inhalation; some patients also have fever, chest or back pain, sputum production, or hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/9,11,12,15,31,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12,15,31,46</a>]. Shortness of breath may progress rapidly to respiratory failure in patients with acute pulmonary toxicity or acute eosinophilic pneumonia.</p><p>Among patients with asthma, snorting or smoking cocaine can cause acute and potentially life-threatening asthma exacerbations with dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, and cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/31,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,44,45</a>]. Patients with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who smoke cocaine on an ongoing basis also have a higher readmission rate than those who only smoke tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Chronic cocaine-induced pulmonary injury can cause slowly progressive dyspnea, chronic productive or nonproductive cough, and intermittent hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/15,24,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,44,45</a>]. In some patients, cough is productive of black sputum (melanoptysis). Melanoptysis is probably due to the inhalation of carbonaceous residue from materials used to ignite crack, such as matches or rags soaked with butane or alcohol. It may also relate to the practice of scraping off and resmoking the black tarry residue left in the pipe after initial use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The presence of thermal burns on fingers or thumbs, the result of handling crack pipes, may raise a suspicion for cocaine as an etiology for pulmonary pathology in patients denying cocaine abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>A discussion of the nonpulmonary manifestations of cocaine intoxication is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1223302\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation and diagnosis of the various cocaine-induced lung diseases typically includes complete blood count with differential, blood chemistries, blood and sputum cultures, pulmonary function testing, pulse oximetry, and chest imaging. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are frequently performed when diffuse radiographic opacities are noted. Lung biopsy is occasionally required, when the radiographic pattern is atypical or the patient fails to improve with supportive care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619968\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific laboratory findings for acute or chronic cocaine-induced pulmonary toxicity. Routine laboratory testing of patients with suspected cocaine-induced pulmonary toxicity typically includes complete blood count and differential, blood cultures, and also levels of drugs of abuse, as indicated. The main role of these tests is to exclude other causes of the clinical manifestations, although some patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia will have eosinophilia in the peripheral blood. The evaluation of patients with acute cocaine intoxication is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Laboratory and radiographic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>As cocaine use is a risk factor for HIV infection with its associated complications, HIV testing is appropriate in cocaine-using patients with respiratory complaints. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Plasma D-dimer testing is commonly used as an initial test in patients suspected of having acute pulmonary embolism. Its accuracy in differentiating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) from vasoconstriction due to cocaine has not been reported, although cocaine use is associated with false positive D-dimer testing. In a prospective, observational study of 4,356 patients undergoing D-dimer measurement for possible PE, multivariate analysis identified cocaine use as a risk factor for a false positive D-dimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role for toxicology testing for cocaine and its metabolites is limited. Cocaine is rapidly metabolized and detectable in blood and urine only briefly (ie, a few hours) after use, so a negative test does not exclude the possibility that cocaine use caused the pulmonary findings. Benzoylecgonine is the major urinary metabolite of cocaine and can be detected in the blood for two days after cocaine use and in the urine for several more days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis#H442013348\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine use disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, medical consequences, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Drug testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1223514\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function testing is generally obtained as part of an evaluation of dyspnea in patients with a subacute or chronic presentation. Studies examining the effect of crack cocaine use on pulmonary function have yielded variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In the largest study of 202 habitual users of crack cocaine, a mild, but statistically significant reduction in diffusing capacity was noted, but spirometry and lung volumes were normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The cause of the mild reduction in diffusing capacity is not known, but may be related to the accumulation of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the alveoli. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoalveolar lavage'</a> below.)</p><p>Pulse oximetry is monitored to determine the adequacy of supplemental oxygen administration. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are obtained to evaluate for alveolar hypoventilation (if mental status is depressed) and to assess the severity of the gas transfer abnormality. ABGs obtained in patients with acute lung injury due to cocaine usually show acute respiratory alkalosis, hypoxemia, and an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-a-a-gradient-alveolar-arterial-gradient-aag\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest radiograph is obtained in the majority of patients presenting with respiratory complaints in the setting of cocaine use.

Typical findings include interlobular septal thickening, peribronchial nodules, ground glass opacities, and areas of consolidation that may evolve into cavitations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53000\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53000 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/31,36,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,36,52</a>]. Patients who inject cocaine intravenously may develop foreign body granulomatosis, due to talc and other agents mixed with the cocaine. The radiographic findings of foreign body granulomatosis include small 2 to 3 mm well-defined nodules, confluent perihilar masses, and ground glass opacities; these findings are discussed separately.

Most patients with respiratory failure will undergo bronchoscopy with BAL, often immediately after intubation. In order to identify diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), BAL is performed with three sequential wedged lavages from the same segment. The presence of increasingly bloody lavage returns is diagnostic of DAH. Samples are also sent for total and differential cell counts and microbiologic analysis (including tests for opportunistic infections), and cytology.
