For patients undergoing elective surgery, hemodialysis is usually performed when practical, either the day before or on the day of the procedure. Peritoneal dialysis is generally performed until just prior to the procedure. Peritoneal dialysate should be drained prior to the procedure.

There are no guidelines that specify a maximum safe level of potassium prior to induction of anesthesia. Decisions regarding treatment of hyperkalemia depend upon the urgency of surgery (ie, whether it is safe to delay surgery for three to four hours to perform dialysis), as well as the likely degree of tissue damage and release of potassium during the planned operation, anticipated blood loss and fluid shifts, chronicity of hyperkalemia, and existing or impending acid-base disturbances that may affect the intraoperative rate of rise of the serum potassium concentration (eg, metabolic acidosis).</p><p>All patients with an elevated serum potassium concentration should have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Hyperkalemia-induced changes in the ECG result from alterations in the transcellular potassium gradient, rather than the absolute serum potassium value. Since dialysis patients often have elevations in total body and intracellular potassium, these transcellular gradients may not be altered with moderate hyperkalemia, accounting for the absence of hyperkalemic changes on the ECG until serum potassium concentrations exceed 6 to 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-on-dialysis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].
