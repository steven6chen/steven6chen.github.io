Lack of ADH can be caused by disorders that act at one or more of the sites involved in ADH secretion: the hypothalamic osmoreceptors; the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei; or the superior portion of the supraopticohypophyseal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By contrast, damage to the tract below the median eminence or to the posterior pituitary generally causes only transient polyuria, because ADH produced in the hypothalamus can still be secreted into the systemic circulation via the portal capillaries in the median eminence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The treatment of CDI, the clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI), and the diagnostic approach to the polyuric patient are discussed separately.

They may also have neurologic symptoms related to the underlying neurologic disease. </p><p>The serum sodium concentration in untreated CDI is often in the high normal range, which is required to provide the ongoing stimulation of thirst to replace the urinary water losses. Moderate to severe hypernatremia can develop when thirst is impaired or cannot be expressed. This can occur in patients with central nervous system lesions who also have hypodipsia or adipsia, in adipsic young patients who have autoantibodies to the subfornical organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], in infants and young children who cannot independently access free water, and in the postoperative period in patients with unrecognized diabetes insipidus (DI).

It is unclear how the deficiency of ADH results in bone loss, particularly since treatment fails to prevent bone disease. However, since ADH acts upon both V1 and V2 receptors and desmopressin principally upon V2 receptors, one possible mechanism is that activation of V1 receptors stimulates bone formation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of central diabetes insipidus (CDI), accounting for the vast majority of cases, are idiopathic diabetes insipidus (DI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>], primary or secondary tumors or infiltrative diseases (such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], neurosurgery, and trauma. In a report of 79 children and young adults, for example, CDI was idiopathic in 52 percent and resulted from a tumor or infiltrative disease in 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In another cohort of 147 children followed from 2000 to 2013 in a single North American center, the most common single diagnosis was craniopharyngioma (25.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify hyperintensities in the posterior pituitary or thickening of the pituitary stalk can help determine the cause of CDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Any form of CDI can be exacerbated or first become apparent during pregnancy, since catabolism of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called arginine vasopressin or AVP) is increased by vasopressinases released from the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic CDI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 to 50 percent of cases of CDI are idiopathic, being associated with destruction of the hormone-secreting cells in the hypothalamic nuclei. It has been suggested that an autoimmune process is involved in many, if not most, patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Insight into the mechanism of autoimmunity in some individuals was provided by a longitudinal study evaluating the presence of cytoplasmic antibodies directed against vasopressin cells (Ab-positive) in patients with endocrine autoimmune diseases but initially without CDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among almost 900 such patients, 9 found to be Ab-positive and 139 Ab-negative controls were prospectively followed. At four years, none of the controls developed CDI. By comparison, four of the nine Ab-positive patients had partial CDI at study entry and, among the remaining five patients, three developed partial DI and one developed complete CDI.</p><p>This autoimmune process is characterized by lymphocytic inflammation of the pituitary stalk and posterior pituitary that resolves after destruction of the target neurons. MRI early in the course often reveals thickening or enlargement of these structures.</p><p>The incidence of such antibodies in those with CDI, their association with other autoimmune diseases, and their correlation with radiologic features was evaluated in a study of 150 patients with CDI that was performed by the same Italian group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The disease was idiopathic in 43 percent, familial in 4 percent, granulomatous in 8 percent, and secondary to cranial trauma, tumor, or surgery in 45 percent. Antibodies to vasopressin cells were found in about one-third of the patients with idiopathic disease and approximately one-quarter of patients with non-idiopathic disease. Antibody positivity was independently associated with age less than 30 years at disease onset in those with idiopathic disease, a history of autoimmune disease, or pituitary stalk thickening. Autoimmune CDI was highly probable in young patients with a history of autoimmune disease and pituitary stalk thickening. </p><p>The autoantigens involved in idiopathic CDI are not fully elucidated. However, autoantibodies to rabphilin-3A, a regulator of secretory vesicle trafficking, may be found in a large majority of patients with lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis (LINH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. LINH accounts for a substantial subset of autoimmune CDI and is characterized by lymphocytic inflammation of the posterior pituitary and infundibular stalk (damage to the stalk is what produces CDI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Other autoimmune mechanisms for CDI include immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related systemic syndrome, which may be successfully treated with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a systemic disease characterized by pauci-immune, necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis, often associated with positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thickening of the pituitary stalk is a nonspecific finding, since some patients with this finding later develop a germinoma or histiocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In children, progressive thickening of the stalk as determined by serial MRIs is strongly suggestive of a germinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Anterior pituitary hormone deficiency, with decreased release of growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, also may be present or develop in patients with idiopathic CDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24</a>]. However, some patients who develop an anterior pituitary endocrinopathy years after the diagnosis of CDI may have a pituitary or suprasellar tumor, suggesting that the initial abnormality was due to an occult pathologic process. As an example, in one study of 16 patients first diagnosed with idiopathic CDI, the detection of evolving gonadotropin deficiency in three individuals resulted in the diagnosis of pituitary or suprasellar germinomas 20, 6, and 3 years after the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These data, if confirmed, suggest that such patients should undergo regular endocrine follow-up.

These include familial CDI, Wolfram syndrome, and congenital diseases such as congenital hypopituitarism and septo-optic dysplasia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718364857\"><span class=\"h3\">Familial CDI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial CDI, also called familial neurohypophyseal DI or FNDI (MIM 125700), is usually an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called arginine vasopressin or AVP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. ADH and its corresponding carrier, neurophysin II, are synthesized as a composite precursor by the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which a single mutant allele causes autosomal dominant FNDI involves the induction of magnocellular cell death by the accumulation of misfolded AVP precursors within the endoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Transfection studies in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells suggest that the mechanism(s) by which a dominant mutant allele causes neurogenic DI is a result of the accumulation of arginine-vasopressin fibrillar aggregates within the endoplasmic reticulum, a so-called toxic gain-of-function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This process is mechanistically similar to that seen in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington and Parkinson diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The handling of misfolded AVP mutants accounts for the delayed onset and progressive nature of dominant FNDI, and the precise mechanism of magnocellular toxicity includes amyloid-like aggregates that lead to autophagy-associated cell death of vasopressin-producing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>This autosomal dominant form of CDI contrasts with congenital AVP deficiency that has been described in three families with autosomal recessive CDI. Two families bear a missense variation affecting the seventh amino acid of the AVP nonapeptide (p.Pro26Leu) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], and four members of one family with two loops of inbreeding bear a large deletion involving the majority of the AVP<strong> </strong>gene as well as the intergenic region between the AVP and OXT gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Affected members have early polyuria and hypernatremia, in contrast to the autosomal dominant disease mentioned above. The existence of this autosomal recessive, early onset CDI is important because it must be considered, along with congenital nephrogenic DI, in the differential diagnosis of congenital polyuria and dehydration, and therapy for these disorders differ. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718364872\"><span class=\"h3\">Wolfram syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Wolfram or DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness) syndrome is characterized by CDI, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness, with cognitive and psychiatric issues that may appear later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; it is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with incomplete penetrance. The Wolfram syndrome is caused by at least two different genes: WFS1 and ZCD2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Both encode endoplasmic reticulum proteins and seem to affect calcium homeostasis. Wolframin, the product of WFS1, is expressed in a number of tissues, including the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and brain supraoptic paraventricular nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. DI in this disorder is due to loss of vasopressin-secreting neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and impaired processing of vasopressin precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Variations in WFS1 also predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. WFS1 negatively regulates a key transcription factor involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling, resulting in pancreatic beta cell death and possibly in magnocellular cell death, which could explain the vasopressin deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Wolfram syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H798843467\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital hypopituitarism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CDI has been described in patients with congenital hypopituitarism with or without ectopia of the posterior pituitary lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. The defects in posterior pituitary function in these disorders include symptomatic CDI, nocturia, reduced ADH release after osmotic challenge, and hypodipsia or polydipsia. These findings may be associated with isolated growth hormone deficiency or multiple anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718365022\"><span class=\"h3\">Septo-optic dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CDI can be seen in a number of congenital cerebral midline abnormalities. As an example, septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) has been associated with defects in both anterior and posterior pituitary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. SOD is a highly heterogeneous condition with phenotypes that include midline and forebrain abnormalities as well as optic nerve and pituitary hypoplasia. Most cases of SOD are sporadic, but familial cases have been described in association with mutations in genes for developmental transcription factors (such as HESX1) that are essential for normal <span class=\"nowrap\">forebrain/pituitary</span> development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Affected patients may have abnormal thirst as well as a defect in ADH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>]. As a result, we recommend monitoring of the serum sodium in these patients once per week for one month, and then if stable, once every six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurosurgery or trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CDI can be induced by neurosurgery (usually transsphenoidal) or trauma to the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>]. The incidence of CDI in these patients varies with the extent of injury, ranging from 10 to 20 percent after transsphenoidal removal of an adenoma limited to the sella to as high as 60 to 80 percent after removal of very large tumors.</p><p>A much lower rate of postoperative CDI has been reported with minimally invasive endoscopic pituitary surgery (2.7 percent permanent and 13.6 percent transient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A serum sodium higher than 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> within the first five days postoperatively had a high predictive value for permanent DI development. By contrast, patients with a serum sodium less than 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in the first five days postoperatively will rarely, if ever, develop permanent DI, thereby validating short postoperative inpatient stays with minimal risk of readmission for DI management.</p><p>Craniopharyngioma has been associated with CDI both before surgery and particularly after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/52,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,56</a>]. A somewhat different response has been detected after transfrontal surgery for a craniopharyngioma. In this setting, the polyuria appears to result in at least some patients from the release of an ADH precursor from the hypothalamus that competes for but does not activate ADH V2 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These patients initially have high serum immunoreactive ADH concentrations, but their ADH has little or no biological activity and they have diminished response to exogenous hormone replacement. Thus, they behave as if they have nephrogenic DI (NDI), although the polyuria is typically transient.</p><p>Severe damage to the hypothalamus or tract by neurosurgery or trauma often results in a typical <strong>triphasic</strong> response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,52</a>]. There is an initial polyuric phase, beginning within 24 hours and lasting 4 to 5 days; this phase reflects inhibition of ADH release due to hypothalamic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This is followed, on days 6 to 11, by an antidiuretic phase in which stored hormone is slowly released from the degenerating posterior pituitary. During this stage, excessive water intake can lead to hyponatremia because of a transient syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Permanent DI may then ensue after the posterior pituitary stores are depleted.</p><p>Most cases are not permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. As an example, patients with less severe hypothalamic or tract injury often have transient CDI that begins 24 to 48 hours after surgery and may then resolve over the first week. Furthermore, not all patients progress through all three phases. Some patients develop transient hyponatremia, with or without preceding polyuria, and then recover.

Lack of ADH can be caused by disorders that act at one or more of the sites involved in ADH secretion: the hypothalamic osmoreceptors; the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei; or the superior portion of the supraopticohypophyseal tract. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with untreated CDI typically present with polyuria, nocturia, and, due to the initial elevation in serum sodium and osmolality, polydipsia. They may also have neurologic symptoms related to the underlying neurologic disease. (See <a href=\"#H141707708\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of CDI include idiopathic disease, familial and congenital disorders, neurosurgery or trauma, primary or secondary cancers, hypoxic encephalopathy, infiltrative disorders, post-supraventricular tachycardia, and anorexia nervosa. The vast majority of cases are due to idiopathic CDI or result from primary or secondary tumors, or infiltrative diseases (such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis).
