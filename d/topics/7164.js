Each of these sites has its own range of normal values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rectal thermometry</strong> &ndash; Rectal thermometry is generally considered the reference standard for measurement of core body temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but there is a lag between changes in core body temperature and temperature in the rectal vault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rectal thermometry is usually performed in infants and young children if the result has clinical implications. The majority of studies establishing the risk of serious infections in febrile infants and young children have relied on rectal temperatures. Rectal thermometry is contraindicated in patients with neutropenia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral thermometry</strong> &ndash; Oral thermometry generally is preferred in children who are old enough to cooperate. Oral temperature is typically 0.6&deg;C (1.0&deg;F) lower than rectal temperature because of mouth breathing, which is particularly important in patients with tachypnea. Oral temperatures also may be affected by recent ingestion of hot or cold liquids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Opinions differ about the best site of temperature measurement for young children who cannot cooperate with oral thermometry. The Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision suggest rectal thermometry for children younger than four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends electronic axillary thermometry for children younger than four weeks, and axillary (electronic or chemical dot) or infra-red tympanic membrane (TM) thermometry for children four weeks to five years of age because these methods are quicker, easier to use, and better accepted by children and their caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Axillary thermometry</strong> &ndash; Axillary temperature is consistently lower than rectal temperature, but the absolute difference varies too widely for a standard conversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Axillary temperatures may be measured in neutropenic patients who are unable to use an oral thermometer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infrared thermometry</strong> &ndash; Infrared TM thermometers measure the amount of heat produced by the TM. Temperature readings are close to core temperature, although the infrared TM reflective devices commonly used in homes, hospitals, and offices are considerably less accurate than TM thermistors used in research and by anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/3,8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-16</a>]. Individual studies comparing TM and rectal temperatures in children have had contradictory results. Systematic reviews have concluded that TM thermometry shows insufficient agreement with established methods of core temperature measurement to be used in situations where detection of fever has clinical implications (eg, laboratory evaluation of the febrile neonate or young infant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/2,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infrared contact and noncontact forehead thermometers measure the amount of heat produced by the temporal arteries. The accuracy of such measurements may be affected by sweating or vascular changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As with tympanic temperature measurement, studies comparing temporal artery and rectal temperatures have contradictory results, and temporal artery temperatures should not be used to make clinical decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/2,3,19-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,19-31</a>]. Readings may be greater or lower than rectal temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smart phones</strong> &ndash; Apps for smart phones that permit tracking of fever are available.

The thermoregulatory center balances heat production, derived primarily from metabolic activity in muscle and the liver, with heat dissipation from the skin and lungs. The thermoregulatory center is able to maintain a fairly steady body temperature in normal temperature environments. However, at environmental temperatures higher than approximately 35&deg;C (95&deg;F), the body's ability to dissipate heat is overwhelmed, and core temperature rises. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heat-stroke-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heat stroke in children&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mean normal temperature is generally considered to be 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This value usually is attributed to studies dating to the 19<sup>th</sup> century. In a more recent study of young adults, the upper limit of normal body temperature (measured orally) was 37.2&deg;C (98.9&deg;F) in the morning and 37.7&deg;C (99.9&deg;F) overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Normal body temperature varies with age, time of the day, level of activity, and phase of the menstrual cycle, among other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>Infants and young children generally have higher temperatures than older children and adults. This relates to the greater surface-area-to-body-weight ratio and the higher metabolic rate of infants and small children. In the newborn period (age 0 to 28 days), the mean normal temperature (measured rectally) is 37.5&deg;C, with an upper limit of normal (ie, two standard deviations above the mean) of 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Normal temperature varies daily, with a morning nadir and late <span class=\"nowrap\">afternoon/early</span> evening peak. The mean amplitude of variation is 0.5&deg;C (0.9&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. During a febrile illness, daily low and high temperature readings are maintained, but at higher-than-normal levels. Daily variation can be as high as 1&deg;C (1.8&deg;F) in some individuals recovering from a febrile illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10722181\"><span class=\"h1\">ELEVATED BODY TEMPERATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated body temperature may result from fever (increased body temperature with elevated hypothalamic set-point) or hyperthermia (increased body temperature with normal hypothalamic set-point) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58558 \">figure 1</a>). It is important to differentiate between these conditions because they have different clinical implications and management strategies.

These cytokines enter the blood and are carried to the anterior hypothalamus, where they induce an abrupt increase in the synthesis of prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The induction of PGE2 in the brain raises the hypothalamic set-point for body temperature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58558 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>After the set-point is raised, the thermoregulatory center recognizes current body temperature to be too low and initiates a series of events to raise body temperature to the new set-point. This involves augmentation of heat production by increased metabolic rate and increased muscle tone and activity, and decreased heat loss through diminished perfusion of the skin. Body temperature rises until a new equilibrium is achieved at the elevated set-point. The upper limit of temperature due to fever appears to be 42&deg;C (107.6&deg;F), but it is unusual for temperature to exceed 41&deg;C (106&deg;F) without some element of concomitant hyperthermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/1,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40,41</a>].</p><p>In addition to causing fever, pyrogenic cytokines increase the synthesis of acute-phase proteins by the liver, decrease serum iron and zinc levels, provoke leukocytosis, and accelerate skeletal muscle proteolysis. IL-1 also induces slow-wave sleep, perhaps explaining the somnolence frequently associated with febrile illnesses. The increase in peripheral PGE2 may account for the myalgias and arthralgias that often accompany fever. Increased heart rate is a normal physiologic response to fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48346430\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits and harms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether fever is beneficial or harmful is disputed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Fever is an integral part of the inflammatory response and, as such, may have a role in fighting infection. However, defense mechanisms can go awry. Even if fever does have a role in defending the host against infection, it may still be that, in some circumstances, fever does more harm than good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential benefits</strong> &ndash; Potential benefits of fever include retardation of the growth and reproduction of some bacteria and viruses (perhaps related to decreased serum iron) and enhanced immunologic function at moderately elevated temperatures (although some of the benefits are reversed at temperatures approaching 40&deg;C [104&deg;F]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/41,44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44-49</a>].

Whether these findings apply to humans is not known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential harms</strong> &ndash; Fever can make patients uncomfortable. It is associated with increased metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and demands on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. For the normal child, these stresses are of little or no consequence. However, for the child in shock or for the child with a pulmonary or cardiac abnormality, the increased demands can be detrimental and may offset any immunologic benefit from the fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In experimental studies, fever has been associated with impaired immunologic responses (eg, phagocytosis of staphylococci and lymphocyte transformation in response to mitogens) and cerebral injury (including edema and hemorrhage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].
