A slow and ungainly run is common in the first two to three years. In some cases, the onset of symptoms occurs later.</p><p>Weakness selectively affects the proximal before the distal limb muscles, and the lower before the upper extremities. The affected child therefore has difficulty running, jumping, and walking up steps. When arising from the floor, affected boys may also use hand support to push themselves to an upright position, an action termed Gower's sign. An unusual waddling gait, lumbar lordosis, and calf enlargement are usually observed. Complaints of leg pain may also be found with early disease. Other motor signs and symptoms that may be present include toe walking, decreased endurance, decreased head control when pulled to sit, flat feet, frequent falls, clumsiness, gross motor delay, inability to keep up with peers, loss of motor skills, and muscle pain or cramping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Physical examination reveals pseudohypertrophy of the calf and (occasionally) quadriceps muscles, lumbar lordosis, a waddling gait, shortening of the Achilles tendons, hypotonia, and hyporeflexia or areflexia.</p><p>Patients are usually wheelchair bound by the age of twelve. Wheelchair-bound children in particular tend to have evidence of scoliosis with poor pulmonary function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2151247394\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevated CK and transaminases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations are elevated in children with DMD prior to the appearance of any clinical signs of disease; increased levels are even observed among newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Serum CK peaks by age two years; it is usually 10 to 20 times the upper limit of normal and may be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These levels then progressively fall at a rate of about 25 percent per year, eventually reaching the normal range in many cases, as more and more muscle is replaced by fat and fibrosis. Aldolase levels and other muscle enzymes, such as aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), are also elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1639446563\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth velocity with DMD is typically slower than normal in the first years of life, leading to short stature, even among boys na&iuml;ve to treatment with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DMD causes a primary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and conduction abnormalities, especially intraatrial and interatrial but also involving the atrioventricular (AV) node, and a variety of arrhythmias, primarily supraventricular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The cardiomyopathy is characterized by extensive fibrosis of the posterobasal left ventricular wall, resulting in the characteristic electrocardiographic changes of tall right precordial R waves with an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S</span> ratio and deep Q waves in leads I, aVL, and V5-6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53681\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53681 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As the disease progresses, fibrosis can spread to the lateral free wall of the left ventricle. Significant mitral regurgitation is often present due to involvement of the posterior papillary muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The incidence of symptomatic cardiomyopathy in patients with DMD increases gradually in the teenage years. This was illustrated in a series of 328 boys with DMD in which clinically apparent cardiomyopathy was observed in about one-third of patients by age 14 years, one-half by 18 years, and all patients older than 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ultrasonography can detect structural changes in the myocardium well before the onset of systolic dysfunction and overt cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Despite the high incidence of DCM, the majority of children with DMD are relatively asymptomatic until late in the disease course, probably because of their inability to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Heart failure and arrhythmias may develop in the late stages of the disease, especially during intercurrent infections or surgery. In rare cases, heart failure dominates the picture and can be the immediate cause of death without marked compromise of respiratory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The possible role of therapy in slowing progression of the cardiomyopathy is discussed separately.

One series of 378 patients (ages 1 to 25 years) with DMD found that 79 (21 percent) had experienced fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The most common mechanism was falling; about half of the fractures occurred among patients who were independent with ambulation. Vertebral fractures are also frequent with glucocorticoid therapy. In one report of 75 patients treated with glucocorticoids, vertebral compression fractures occurred in 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A progressive scoliosis develops in nearly all children with DMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Scoliosis, in combination with progressive weakness, results in impaired pulmonary function. With progressive disease, patients may eventually suffer acute respiratory failure.

However, an occasional child may have average or above-average intelligence. Compared with the general population, DMD is also associated with increased rates of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4290600740\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with DMD are often confined to wheelchair by about age 13 years and die in their late teens or twenties from respiratory insufficiency or cardiomyopathy; only a few DMD patients survive beyond the third decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

This retained strength permits the clinical distinction between BMD and DMD. Patients typically remain ambulatory at least until age 16 and commonly well into adult life. Some patients maintain ambulation into old age. Intellectual disability (mental retardation) and contractures are also not as common or severe and there is relative preservation of neck flexor muscle strength in BMD and intermediate types of muscular dystrophy.</p><p>In patients with BMD, serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations are usually elevated above the upper limit of normal by a factor of five or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although muscle involvement is less severe than in DMD, cardiac involvement in BMD is often a predominant feature of the presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In one report, for example, echocardiography revealed evidence of cardiac involvement in 60 to 70 percent of patients (mean age 18) with subclinical or benign BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It was suggested that, because patients with mild BMD are still able to perform strenuous exercise, the associated mechanical stress on the heart may be harmful for myocardial cells with abnormal dystrophin.</p><p>Echocardiography reveals early right ventricular involvement with the later development of left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. All four chambers are eventually involved with fibrosis, and a cardiomyopathy with heart failure can be rapidly progressive. In addition, abnormalities of the AV node and infranodal conduction system can result in fascicular and bundle branch block and can progress to complete heart block. Although not typically performed, endomyocardial biopsy shows a variable distribution of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Discontinuous immunostaining of cardiac dystrophin is characteristic of BMD and the absence of immunostaining may be associated with more severe cardiac disease.</p><p>Patients with BMD usually survive beyond the age of 30 years.

Hence, many carriers have CK values in the normal range, so genetic testing (ideally with the mutation first identified in the affected boy) should be used to determine carrier status wherever possible.

However, independent standing and walking is never achieved, in contrast to DMD. Weakness is predominately proximal and affects the legs more than the arms. Additional manifestations include sparing of face and eye muscles, tongue atrophy with fasciculations, areflexia, a fine tremor-like form of myoclonus (minipolymyoclonus) affecting distal limbs, dysphagia, and respiratory insufficiency. Muscular weakness usually leads to progressive scoliosis; the combination of respiratory muscle weakness and scoliosis may result in restrictive lung disease. Some develop joint contractures and ankylosis of the mandible. The ability to sit independently is usually lost in the teenage years.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with the most severe clinical symptoms. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has a similar presentation to DMD, but typically has a later onset and a milder clinical course. Patients with an intermediate phenotype (outliers) may be classified clinically as having either mild DMD or severe BMD. There are also patients with isolated cardiomyopathy without any skeletal muscle weakness. (See <a href=\"#H5411166\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With DMD, the clinical onset of weakness usually occurs between two and three years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66517 \">table 2</a>). Muscle weakness affects the proximal before the distal limb muscles. Additional features include cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities, bone fractures, and scoliosis. Serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations are markedly elevated. Affected children frequently have varying degrees of mild cognitive impairment. Physical examination reveals pseudohypertrophy of the calf and (occasionally) quadriceps muscles, lumbar lordosis, a waddling gait, shortening of the Achilles tendons, and hyporeflexia or areflexia in weak muscles. Patients with DMD are often confined to a wheelchair by about age 12 to 13 years and die in their late teens or twenties from respiratory insufficiency or cardiomyopathy. Rarely, patients survive in their early thirties. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical phenotypes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Duchenne muscular dystrophy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with DMD, the age of onset of symptoms of those with BMD is usually later and the degree of clinical involvement milder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66517 \">table 2</a>). Patients with BMD typically remain ambulatory beyond the age of 16 years and often well into adult life, and usually survive beyond the age of 30 years. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Becker muscular dystrophy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to DMD and BMD, dystrophinopathy can present in adulthood with DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy with little or no muscle weakness. Some female carriers are symptomatic, with a high variability in age at onset and severity of weakness. (See <a href=\"#H89732323\" class=\"local\">'DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4154008976\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic females'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dystrophinopathy is usually suspected in a boy with muscle weakness, myopathic signs, and (possibly) a family history of the illness. Molecular genetic testing is indicated for patients with an elevated serum CK level and clinical findings suggestive of a dystrophinopathy. The diagnosis is established if a disease-causing mutation of the DMD gene is identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80692 \">table 1</a>). Although seldom necessary, a muscle biopsy with dystrophin analysis can confirm the diagnosis if the genetic studies are negative or equivocal.
