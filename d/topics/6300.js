Apart from the primary structural-functional defect, secondary epigenetic factors (eg, differentially regulated expression of a host of other genes involved in the maintenance and function of this microenvironment, induction of inflammatory cascades) and environmental factors further contribute to the highly variable phenotype of EB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of EB are discussed in this topic.

Over a 16-year period (1986 through 2002), the prevalence of EB was estimated to be approximately 11 per million and the incidence approximately 20 per million live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Over the same period, the incidence rates of EB by subtype were approximately eight per million live births for EB simplex, three per million live births for junctional EB, two per million live births for dominant dystrophic EB, and three per million live births for recessive dystrophic EB.

In the vast majority of cases, EBS is caused by mutations in the keratin genes, resulting in the formation of a cleavage plane at the level of the basal keratinocytes. Rare variants are associated with mutations in genes encoding other structural proteins of the basal membrane zone, including desmoplakin, plakophilin-1, plakoglobin, integrins A6 and B4, type XVII collagen, plectin, transglutaminase 5, and dystonin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52111\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52111 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Most mutations are nonsense or <span class=\"nowrap\">insertion/deletion</span> mutations causing premature chain termination.</p><p>Type XVII collagen is mainly expressed in hemidesmosomes but is also present in extracutaneous tissues such as the eye and the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. However, in these JEB cases the clinical manifestations are mainly limited to the skin, hair, and mucous membranes and generally do not involve other organs as in other forms of JEB.</p><p>Up to 30 percent of patients with generalized intermediate JEB due to mutations in <em>COL17A1</em> or <em>LAMB3</em> present with the &quot;revertant mosaicism&quot; phenomenon, also called &quot;natural gene therapy&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. This phenomenon occurs when a causative germline mutation is locally corrected by a spontaneous genetic event in a somatic cell, including intragenic crossover, second-site mutation, mitotic gene conversion, or true back mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Revertant mosaicism may explain milder than expected phenotypes in some patients with generalized intermediate JEB. These patients present at birth or later in life with skin areas that are typically darker than affected areas and do not blister.</p><p>The JEB variant with pyloric atresia is caused by mutations in the genes <em>ITGB4</em> and <em>ITGA6</em> encoding the hemidesmosomal protein alpha-6 beta-4 integrin. The level of tissue separation in JEB-PA is just above the plasma membrane. A total lack of functional alpha-6 beta-4 integrin, due to mutations generating premature termination codons in both alleles, is associated with severe skin fragility and early mortality. However, more subtle missense mutations have been identified in association with milder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. </p><p>Homozygous mutations in the <em>ITGA3</em> gene encoding the transmembrane integrin receptor subunit integrin alpha-3 have been reported in three patients with a new form of epidermolysis bullosa, JEB with respiratory and renal involvement, characterized by mild skin fragility but fatal multiorgan involvement with congenital nephrotic syndrome and interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The structural abnormalities detected in these patients (eg, subepidermal multi-layer blistering with lamina densa located in the blister floor with intact hemidesmosomes and cell fragments) are similar to those described in integrin alpha-3 knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These observations indicate that integrin alpha-3 is indispensable for epidermal cell adhesion and basement-membrane organization.</p><p>Mutations of the <em>LAMA3A</em> gene, encoding the laminin alpha-3a polypeptide, a component of the laminin-332 heterotrimer, are associated with the laryngo-onycho-cutaneous (LOC) syndrome, a distinct variant of localized JEB, seen in families from the Punjab region of Pakistan and India. The affected individuals are generally homozygous for the recessive frameshift mutation 151insG in <em>LAMA3A</em> on chromosome 18q11.2. However, LOC syndrome can be caused by other mutations in exon 39 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. </p><p>Mutations causing JEB are generally inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. However, unusual inheritance patterns have been described in some JEB patients, including autosomal dominant traits and uniparental isodisomy (inheritance of two identical copies of one parental chromosome) of chromosome 1 with reduction to homozygosity or compound heterozygosity (two different pathogenic mutations in the same gene that together are sufficient to manifest a recessive phenotype) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>].

DEB is caused by mutations in the <em>COL7A1</em> gene encoding the alpha-1 chain of type VII collagen. Collagen VII is the main constituent of the anchoring fibrils located below the lamina densa of the epidermal basement membrane zone.

Less frequently, deletions and splice-junction mutations have been identified. Both the mutated and the wild-type allele are expressed in DDEB, so some anchoring fibrils are functionally intact, accounting for the relatively mild phenotype.

Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for premature termination codon mutations in <em>COL7A1</em> result in null alleles and complete absence of anchoring fibrils, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy and by negative or severely reduced immunofluorescence for type VII collagen epitopes. Complete absence of anchoring fibrils is associated with extreme skin fragility, extensive scarring, joint contractures and deformity, severe mucosal involvement, malnutrition, and growth retardation. </p><p>In milder forms of RDEB, different types of mutations (eg, missense or splice site mutations) and allelic combinations (eg, a premature termination codon mutation on one allele and a missense mutation or in-frame deletion on the other) result in defective collagen VII synthesis and structurally abnormal anchoring fibrils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

KS is caused by mutations in the <em>FERMT1</em> gene, encoding the focal adhesion protein fermitin family homolog 1, also called kindlin-1, resulting in tissue cleavage at variable levels in the BMZ zone. KS presents at birth or in early infancy with trauma-induced skin blistering that predominantly involves the acral sites and heals with atrophic changes.
