People with scarlet fever usually also have a sore throat. This is because scarlet fever is caused by the bacteria that cause a condition called &quot;strep throat.&quot; A person with scarlet fever has a red rash and usually has strep throat, too.</p><p>Strep throat is common in children. But not all children with strep throat get scarlet fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424220\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of scarlet fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash &ndash; This usually starts on the head and neck and spreads to the body, arms, and legs. It causes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Red spots that turn white when you press on the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small, raised bumps &ndash; Skin might feel rough, like sandpaper.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peeling skin &ndash; This happens when the rash is going away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bright red tongue with small bumps on it &ndash; Doctors call this a &quot;strawberry tongue&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83203\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83203 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p>A person with scarlet fever might also have symptoms of strep throat. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sore throat &ndash; This might start suddenly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White patches in the back of the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen glands in the neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>These symptoms usually get better in 2 to 5 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424235\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you or your child has a sore throat and rash, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424250\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for scarlet fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and look at the rash. He or she can also check for the bacteria that cause strep throat and scarlet fever. The doctor or nurse will run a swab (Q-Tip) along the back of your child's throat, and test it for the bacteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424265\"><span class=\"h1\">How is scarlet fever treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scarlet fever is treated with antibiotics. The antibiotics reduce the symptoms of scarlet fever and keep it from spreading to other people.</p><p>Antibiotics also keep scarlet fever from causing other health problems. In some people, the bacteria that cause scarlet fever can cause a serious disease called &quot;acute rheumatic fever.&quot; This disease damages the heart and causes other problems. The heart damage gets worse over time.</p><p>Children between the ages of 5 and 15 are the most likely to get acute rheumatic fever. If your child gets scarlet fever, he or she needs antibiotics. The antibiotics kill the bacteria so they do not cause acute rheumatic fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424280\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=strep-throat-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Strep throat in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
