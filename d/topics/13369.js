The management of patients with peptic ulcer disease is based on the etiology, ulcer characteristics, and anticipated natural history. This topic will review the initial management of peptic ulcer disease. The management of recurrent and refractory peptic ulcer disease, the complications of peptic ulcer disease, surgical management of peptic ulcer disease, and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease are discussed separately.
