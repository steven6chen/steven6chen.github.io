Carcinoid tumors can start growing in the digestive tract, lungs, or other parts of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 2</a>). They are also called &quot;neuroendocrine tumors.&quot; These tumors sometimes then spread to other parts of the body.</p><p>Carcinoid syndrome happens with some, but not all, carcinoid tumors. Most commonly, carcinoid syndrome happens when a carcinoid tumor that started in the small intestine spreads to the liver. Carcinoid syndrome happens because carcinoid tumors can make hormones and other substances. When the tumor has spread to the liver, these substances can get into the blood. When these substances get into the blood, they can travel around the body and cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83929774\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of &quot;flushing&quot; &ndash; Flushing is when your skin gets red or purple and feels hot. This is the most common symptom of carcinoid syndrome. An episode of flushing usually starts suddenly and lasts 30 seconds to 30 minutes. Flushing usually happens on the face, neck, or upper chest. Episodes can sometimes be triggered by certain things, such as eating a big meal or drinking alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spider veins, called &quot;telangiectasias&quot; &ndash; These are small, swollen veins that look like purple spots on the skin. They are usually on the nose, cheek, or upper lip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watery diarrhea that is not bloody</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing (noisy breathing) or trouble breathing</p><p/><p>Sometimes, carcinoid tumors cause a type of heart disease called &quot;carcinoid heart disease.&quot; Carcinoid heart disease doesn't always cause symptoms. When it does, it can cause swelling or trouble breathing, or make people feel tired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83929789\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for carcinoid syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam. He or she will also order tests to make sure you have carcinoid syndrome and look for carcinoid tumors in your body.</p><p>Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests &ndash; This involves collecting all of the urine you make for 24 hours. This is the test done most often to check whether carcinoid syndrome is the cause of your symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They include CT and MRI scans, as well as other tests that involve injecting a special substance into the veins and then getting images of the body. These tests are usually done to find the location of the carcinoid tumor that is causing your symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure that lets the doctor look at the inside of your stomach and first part of your small intestine. The doctor will put a thin tube with a camera and light on the end in your mouth and down into your stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart as it beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83929850\"><span class=\"h1\">How is carcinoid syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms, where your carcinoid tumor or tumors are, and how much the cancer has spread in your body. It usually involves one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that block a carcinoid tumor from making the substances that cause symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-diarrhea medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove all or part of a carcinoid tumor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure to block a carcinoid tumor's blood supply, called &quot;embolization&quot; &ndash; This is done only for tumors in the liver. During this procedure, the doctor blocks off the blood vessel that sends blood to the tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ablation therapy &ndash; This is a procedure that can kill cancer cells. It does not involve surgery. It is done only for tumors in the liver. Doctors can do ablation therapy in different ways. For example, they can use heat or a laser to kill the cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term doctors for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for carcinoid heart disease &ndash; In some cases, this involves surgery to replace a diseased heart valve with a healthy heart valve.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83929865\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to prevent flushing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you find that certain things trigger your flushing, you can try to avoid those things. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83929880\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for carcinoid syndrome involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83929895\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
