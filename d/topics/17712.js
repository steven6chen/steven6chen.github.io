The majority of uncomplicated genital chlamydial infections are asymptomatic in men and women; these infections may only be found after screening, but should be treated promptly as suggested below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H88323163\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Chlamydia and gonorrhea'</a>.)</p><p>We typically suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 gram single-dose therapy) with observed therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> (100 mg twice daily for seven days) can also be used in nonpregnant patients with counseling on the need for adherence for optimal outcome. Doxycycline has been shown to be marginally more effective for genital chlamydia when directly observed therapy can be provided for the full course of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], but this is rarely possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60697861\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of life cycle on antibiotic selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection requires special consideration, largely due to its rather unique life cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The infectious form of the organism, the extracellular elementary body, is metabolically inert and resistant to killing. Thus, antibiotics must target the sequestered intracellular and intravacuolar phases of the life cycle of this pathogen. For this reason, antibiotics with good intracellular penetration must be used.</p><p>In addition, antibiotic concentrations must be present throughout the entire 36- to 48-hour life cycle of the organism. Thus, either a prolonged course of therapy or selection of an antibiotic with a long half-life is required to ensure adequate levels of the antibiotic agent.</p><p>Antibiotic resistance appears to be exceedingly rare. The intracellular nature of the pathogen eliminates the opportunity for rapid evolution of cell surface components that could contribute to drug resistance. Furthermore, the elementary body is relatively inert, which limits opportunities for replication and the generation of antibiotic-resistant mutations. These features may also explain the paucity of inflammatory responses and the asymptomatic nature of most chlamydial infections. (See <a href=\"#H342789\" class=\"local\">'Management of repeat infection'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5623059\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic selection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5623486\"><span class=\"h3\">Defining antibiotic efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To be considered effective for a sexually transmitted infection, the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that an antibiotic agent should achieve a microbiologic cure in more than 95 percent of treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Microbial cure is a more reliable parameter for drug efficacy than clinical cure for 2 reasons: 1) a significant proportion of patients may have other coinfections that will not respond to the administered drug and 2) most patients have no clinical manifestations at baseline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5623067\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, <em>C. trachomatis</em> is highly susceptible to tetracyclines and macrolides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Within these two classes, first-line agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, respectively. The CDC recommends either agent as first-line therapy for the treatment of chlamydial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. We prefer the use of azithromycin (1 gram single-dose therapy) with observed therapy when possible. If it is not available, then we use doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for seven days with patient counseling on the need for adherence for optimal outcome. Delayed release doxycycline (200 mg daily for seven days) appears as effective as and better tolerated than twice-daily doxycycline but is more costly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although there is emerging evidence that the microbial efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> may be greater than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, the clinical relevance and impact of this finding is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 23 randomized trials with over 2000 patients that compared the efficacy of doxycycline with azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated genital chlamydial infections in men and women, microbial cure rates were slightly but significantly higher with doxycycline than azithromycin (97.4 versus 96.2 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It should be noted that microbiological cure in earlier studies included in the meta-analysis was documented with culture or enzyme immunoassay testing rather than the more sensitive nucleic acid amplification technique (NAAT) assay, which is preferred today. In one of the trials included in the meta-analysis, among men with nongonococcal urethritis randomly assigned to receive different antibiotic regimens, the microbial clearance rate for the 115 men with <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection<em> </em>was higher with a doxycycline-based than an azithromycin-based regimen (94.8 versus 77.4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a subsequent trial of 310 adolescents and young adults who screened positive for <em>C. trachomatis</em> by NAAT upon entrance into a correctional facility, microbial cure rates at 28 days were high for both doxycycline and azithromycin (each administered as directly-observed therapy), but were numerically higher for doxycycline (100 versus 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The implications of these findings are not clear, and expert opinion about a possible threat of emerging <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> resistance has ranged from acknowledging the need for more data to suggesting the evaluation of longer or enhanced dosing regimens of azithromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Until more data are available, we continue to use both azithromycin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and favor azithromycin given as observed therapy. The single dose directly observed azithromycin treatment option is highly effective and ensures therapy completion, whereas completion of the multiday doxycycline schedule is not guaranteed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Directly observed therapy with the full course of doxycycline is rarely possible.</p><p>In comparative studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, adverse events occurred in approximately one-quarter of the patients in both treatment arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. The most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature and included diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and dyspepsia; no serious adverse events were reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5623074\"><span class=\"h4\">Advantages of azithromycin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azithromycin</a> has excellent intracellular and tissue penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Due to its half-life of five to seven days, azithromycin can be administered as single-dose therapy (1 gram orally) under direct observation. It can be used in pregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below.)</p><p>Providing single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> on-site at the time of diagnosis, if possible, is strongly recommended to ensure compliance and to decrease the risk of complicated infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. This is particularly important when asymptomatic chlamydial infection is detected as part of routine screening, since it is unclear how long the patient may have been infected. In one study of 4158 women with positive screening tests for <em>C. trachomatis</em>, only 24 percent were treated presumptively on the day of their visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, shortages in the supply of doxycycline have occurred, resulting in increases or unpredictable fluctuations in cost. Furthermore, whether patients will be compliant with seven full days of twice-daily dosing is a relevant concern (see <a href=\"#H343008\" class=\"local\">'Patient counseling'</a> below). However, whether seven full days of twice-daily dosing is required for clinical cure is unclear since microbiologic cures have been attained in patients with suboptimal adherence to a seven-day regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5623088\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5623096\"><span class=\"h4\">Quinolones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The quinolones <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> are both highly effective against <em>C. trachomatis</em> but require a full week of therapy and are considerably more costly than either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>.

One in vitro study was able to demonstrate that a clinical strain of <em>C. trachomatis</em> was able to acquire a resistance element from a <em>C. suis</em> strain within coculture experiments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SEX PARTNERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44\"><span class=\"h2\">Issues of reinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex partners are typically asymptomatic and, unless treated, will reinfect the index patient or spread infection to other partners. In fact, rates of reinfection among index cases of women with <em>C. trachomatis</em> range from 15 to 30 percent, and are typically associated with resumption of sex with previously established partners (not new partners) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45\"><span class=\"h2\">Partner assessment and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, sex partners of persons with chlamydial infection should be examined, tested for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, treated, and counseled on prevention. This should occur for all individuals who had sexual contact with the patient within the 60 days prior to infection. Unfortunately, this approach is infrequently successful. The alternative traditional approach of using public health field workers to notify exposed sex partners can be useful, but is costly and is not available in most areas. In lieu of public health advocacy, patients are asked to notify their partners of the need for medical evaluation and treatment. This approach has been deemed a public health failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In such cases, expedited partner therapy is a potential recourse, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46\"><span class=\"h2\">Expedited partner therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A strategy termed &quot;expedited partner therapy&quot; (EPT) has been proposed as an alternative way to increase the proportion of sex partners receiving treatment and to decrease rates of reinfection in the index patient. With EPT, treatment (without examination) is facilitated by giving an antibiotic or a prescription to the index patient or by calling in a prescription directly for the partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. EPT for chlamydia can be accomplished with single-dose oral therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Patients and sexual partners should be counseled to abstain from sexual activity until the therapeutic course of antibiotics is completed, or in the case of azithromycin, for seven days after the single-dose treatment was administered.</p><p>In one randomized controlled trial, 2751 patients (23 percent male) with diagnosed gonococcal infection, chlamydial infection, or both were assigned either to an &quot;expedited treatment group&quot; or a standard referral group. Patients in the expedited treatment group were given &quot;partner packets&quot; of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> to distribute to their partners, without requiring a formal medical evaluation of the partners. In the standard referral arm, patients simply notified their sex partners of the need for evaluation and treatment. Patients assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners were significantly more likely to report that all of their partners had been treated compared with those assigned to the standard referral arm (61 versus 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The trial also demonstrated a significant benefit in lowering the number of recurrent infections among those assigned to expedited treatment (relative risk of reinfection 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.97).</p><p>The limitations of this approach include lost opportunities for screening and counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and a risk of adverse events related to antibiotic administration. In the United States, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consensus is that EPT offers a valuable means to control sexually transmitted infections and is an option for partner management, although ongoing evaluation of this approach is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Clinicians in the United States should routinely employ EPT for the partners of persons with chlamydial infection, to the extent permitted by regional laws and regulations where they are practicing, when follow-up is in question. EPT is generally not recommended for men who have sex with men (MSM) because of the high-risk for co-infections and the limited data evaluating the efficacy among this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The legal status of EPT is state specific, although surveys indicate that many clinicians frequently pursue the practice in managing their patients with sexually transmitted infections. The legal status of EPT options can be found at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/ept&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsa9uegsYMY5hC/1s56C9muQ2nw5djAdqeqLGMi2ue6Yh&amp;TOPIC_ID=2742\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cdc.gov/std/ept</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR CHLAMYDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for <em>C. trachomatis</em> is a critically important tool in the control of this infection, and is discussed in a separate section.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General treatment principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete care of the patient presenting with a chlamydial infection should include active antimicrobial therapy, directed or empiric therapy for concomitant gonococcal infection, if appropriate, counseling for HIV testing, counseling to return for persistent or recurrent symptoms, retesting to evaluate for recurrent infection, and treatment of sexual partners. (See <a href=\"#H230641\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial agents that have excellent activity against <em>C. trachomatis</em> include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (a macrolide).

For patients with uncomplicated genital chlamydial infections, we suggest directly observed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> rather than unobserved azithromycin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Azithromycin is given as a 1000 mg single dose. Doxycycline is dosed at 100 mg twice daily for seven days. Both are highly effective, but directly observed therapy ensures completion of the regimen. Patients who are prescribed doxycycline should be counseled on treatment adherence. Women should also have pregnancy testing since doxycycline is not recommended for pregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H5622559\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of uncomplicated genital chlamydia infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections may coexist in a significant percentage of community patients, which has a direct impact on treatment since first-line agents for chlamydia do not have activity against gonococci. Additional empiric therapy for gonorrhea should be based on a high suspicion of infection (eg, a positive Gram stain in men, a sexual partner recently diagnosed with gonorrhea). (See <a href=\"#H60698042\" class=\"local\">'Coinfection with gonorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric therapy for chlamydial infection should be offered to persons who present with symptoms suggestive of infection (cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, urethritis). This is especially true if follow-up cannot be ensured and if relatively insensitive diagnostic testing is being used (eg, culture rather than nucleic acid amplification testing). (See <a href=\"#H5622636\" class=\"local\">'Indications for empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with clinical symptoms of proctitis (eg, tenesmus), we treat empirically for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

Doxycycline is given orally at 100 mg twice daily and ceftriaxone is given as a single 250 mg intramuscular dose.
