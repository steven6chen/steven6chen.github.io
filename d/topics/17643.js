The first medicine that most people with type 2 diabetes take is a pill called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">metformin</a> (brand name: Glucophage).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080855\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my treatment is working?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One way to know if your treatment is working is to check your blood sugar level. People can use a device called a &quot;blood glucose monitor&quot; to check their blood sugar level at home. If your doctor recommends that you use a blood glucose monitor, he or she will teach you how and tell you when to use it.</p><p>Your doctor can also do a blood test called an &quot;A1C.&quot; This test checks what your blood sugar level has been over the past 2 to 3 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080862\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my blood sugar level is still higher than normal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your blood sugar level is still higher than normal after you have been taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">metformin</a> for 2 to 3 months, your doctor might add a second medicine to your treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080869\"><span class=\"h1\">Which second medicine will I take?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different medicines your doctor can prescribe. The choice will depend, in part, on your weight, your other health problems, and if you want to use a shot.</p><p>Some of these medicines can cause low blood sugar as a side effect. Symptoms of low blood sugar can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating and shaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling worried</p><p/><p>Low blood sugar should be treated quickly because it can cause you to pass out. Your doctor or nurse will tell you ahead of time how to treat low blood sugar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080876\"><span class=\"h1\">What is insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin is a medicine that lowers a person's blood sugar level. People who use insulin might use it as a second medicine, or as their only medicine. It usually comes in the form of a shot that people give themselves. One brand of insulin comes in the form of a powder that is breathed into the lungs.</p><p>If your doctor prescribes insulin, he or she will tell you which form to use and show you how to give yourself a shot, if needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80789 \">figure 1</a>). He or she will also tell you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which type of insulin to use &ndash; There are different types of the insulin that come in a shot. Some types work faster or last longer than others.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much insulin to use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When to use it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When to check your blood sugar level</p><p/><p>An insulin dose often needs to change when a person gets sick, has surgery, travels, or eats out. Ask your doctor or nurse how to change your dose during these times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080883\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatments might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes, people with type 2 diabetes need medicines to treat health problems that often affect people with diabetes. For example, people who have high blood pressure might take medicines to lower their blood pressure. This can reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080890\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with diabetes see their doctor or nurse every 3 or 4 months. When you see your doctor or nurse, he or she will talk with you about your medicines and blood sugar levels. If your blood sugar levels are not in control, your doctor or nurse might make changes to your treatment plan.</p><p>Taking care of diabetes can be hard, and some people feel sad or worried about their diabetes. Let your doctor or nurse know if you feel this way so that he or she can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080897\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-abcs-of-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: The ABCs of diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemoglobin-a1c-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemoglobin A1C tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-blood-sugar-in-people-with-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low blood sugar in people with diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-mellitus-and-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes mellitus and diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-alcohol-exercise-and-medical-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Alcohol, exercise, and medical care (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
