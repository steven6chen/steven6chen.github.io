This recommendation is based not only on the fact atrial flutter carries a risk for systemic embolization but also that these patients usually have episodes of AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to anticoagulation applies to all types of atrial flutter, whether it is typical or atypical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF THROMBUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with atrial flutter have alternating periods of atrial fibrillation (AF) making it difficult to know the exact risk of thrombus formation (and subsequent embolization) attributable to atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Atrial mechanical function is not normal in patients with atrial flutter. However, transmitral Doppler echocardiography demonstrates more organized atrial mechanical function with sustained atrial flutter, as opposed to AF, in which organized atrial contraction is absent. One study performed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) immediately before and after cardioversion in 19 patients with atrial flutter and 44 patients with AF with the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to cardioversion, patients with atrial flutter had greater left atrial appendage ejection velocities and shear rates compared to those with AF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After cardioversion, left atrial appendage flow velocities and shear rates decreased in both groups of patients, but the impaired left atrial appendage function was less pronounced in patients with atrial flutter. New or increased spontaneous echo contrast, a marker of blood stasis, occurred significantly less often in patients with atrial flutter (21 versus 50 percent for AF).</p><p/><p>TEE evidence of atrial thrombi has been documented in a number of reports of patients with atrial flutter not receiving chronic anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. As with AF, the thrombi overwhelmingly involve or are exclusively within the left atrial appendage. The frequency with which this occurs may vary with the duration of the arrhythmia and other risk factors (similar to AF) as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two series evaluated patients with atrial flutter for a mean duration of 33 to 36 days who did not have a history of AF, rheumatic heart disease, or a prosthetic heart valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A left atrial thrombus was found in 1 to 1.6 percent, a right atrial thrombus in 1 percent, and spontaneous left atrial echo contrast in 11 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In one of these reports, there was a close correlation between a history of previous embolism and periods of AF during atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial thrombi and spontaneous echo contrast may be more common in patients with atrial flutter of longer duration. In a TEE study of 30 patients with persistent atrial flutter (duration 6.4 months), two patients (7 percent) had thrombus in the left atrial appendage, and 25 percent had spontaneous echo contrast prior to cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As described below in more depth (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cardioversion'</a> below) and mentioned above, left atrial contractile function transiently declines after cardioversion in many patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left atrial thrombus was present in 5 of 47 consecutive patients (11 percent) with atrial flutter for a mean duration of 28 days who did not have a history of AF or mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458946394\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBOLIC RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of embolization in atrial flutter is related to risk factors and the need for cardioversion or ablation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529118712\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors and lone atrial flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for clinical thromboembolism include valvular heart disease (eg, rheumatic valve disease, prosthetic valves), increasing age, depressed left ventricular systolic function or heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, and a history of thromboembolism. </p><p>Atrial flutter without an identifiable risk factor is called lone atrial flutter. It is relatively uncommon, occurring in only 3 of 181 adults with atrial flutter in a population-based study (1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and in 8 percent of children and young adults with atrial flutter in a multicenter series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The embolic risk associated with lone atrial flutter was evaluated in a review of 59 mostly elderly patients with lone atrial flutter (mean age at diagnosis 70 years); 75 percent developed recurrent episodes or persistent atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At presentation, these patients did not have coronary heart disease, hyperthyroidism, heart failure, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, obstructive lung disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or known antecedent atrial fibrillation (AF). At the time of diagnosis, 25 were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and six with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>; at last follow-up, 28 were treated with aspirin and 13 with warfarin.</p><p>The following observations were noted at an average follow-up of 10 years:</p><p>AF developed in 33 patients (56 percent), which was paroxysmal in 25 and permanent in eight. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more ischemic cerebrovascular events occurred in 19 patients (32 percent) at a mean age of 80, including six who were in AF at the time of the event. Compared to age- and sex-adjusted expected rates of thromboembolism, the thromboembolic risk was significantly increased in the patients with lone atrial flutter (hazard ratio 5.2 in patients with controlled hypertension and 2.5 in patients without a history of hypertension).</p><p/><p>When compared to patients with lone AF, the patients with lone atrial flutter had, after adjustment for age and sex, a significantly higher rate of thromboembolism (hazard ratio 2.6). The risk was lower and no longer significant when only patients without a history of hypertension were included (hazard ratio 1.9).

In a systematic review based upon limited data, the long-term embolic risk in patients with sustained atrial flutter (with varying risk factors) was estimated to be approximately 3 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For comparison, the rate of thromboembolism in patients with AF &lt;1 percent per year in patients with no risk factors, with the rate increasing with increasing CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83272 \">table 1</a>).

In a review of the Medicare database, the risk of stroke was significantly increased in patients with atrial flutter (relative risk 1.41 compared to a control group). In these patients, the relative risk was 1.56 in patients who subsequently had an episode of AF (similar to the risk with AF alone), while those with isolated atrial flutter had a stroke risk not significantly different from the control population (relative risk 1.11) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67382\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67382 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the risk of embolization at the time of cardioversion is increased compared to individuals not undergoing cardioversion, the absolute thromboembolism risk of cardioversion for pure atrial flutter is not known with a high degree of confidence due to the fact that many patients included in reports of atrial flutter cardioversion related events also had episodes of AF (but happened to be in atrial flutter at the time of cardioversion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/3,13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,15-17</a>]. </p><p>The studies that have attempted to evaluate the risk at the time of cardioversion studied different populations. Some included patients with a prior history of thromboembolism and were thus more likely to report high event rates, while studies in which at least some patients were anticoagulated or underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before cardioversion were more likely to report low event rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/3,12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-17</a>]. </p><p>Three early studies found no embolic events in a total of 314 patients with atrial flutter (and without AF) who underwent elective cardioversion for atrial flutter without anticoagulation prior to or after cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/4,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,19</a>]. However, the overall incidence is 0.6 to 1.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] with a higher risk in patients with a history of AF or underlying heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. In a meta-analysis of these studies, the rate of short-term emboli ranged from 0 to 7.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Embolization may be related to a transient reduction in atrial mechanical function, referred to as atrial &quot;stunning&quot;, and is common after successful cardioversion of atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/2,5,6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,20,21</a>]. In one report, left atrial appendage ejection velocity fell by 26 percent within 15 minutes of cardioversion and almost 50 percent of subjects had new or worsened spontaneous echo contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These changes predispose to de novo thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similar observations have been made in patients with AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamic-consequences-of-atrial-fibrillation-and-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Atrial stunning'</a>.)</p><p>However, the severity of atrial stunning appears to be somewhat less pronounced in atrial flutter than in AF, which could explain the lower embolic risk after cardioversion in atrial flutter. In a report that compared 19 patients with atrial flutter to 44 with AF, the left atrial appendage flow velocity was significantly higher in the patients with atrial flutter at baseline (42 versus 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> in atrial fibrillation) and after cardioversion (27 versus 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, new or increased spontaneous echo contrast was significantly less likely in those with atrial flutter (21 versus 50 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458947186\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiofrequency catheter ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial stunning (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cardioversion'</a> above) also occurs after radiofrequency catheter ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The likelihood of developing atrial stunning and its duration were assessed in a review of 15 patients with persistent atrial flutter (mean duration 17 months) and seven with paroxysmal atrial flutter who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Significant left atrial stunning and spontaneous echo contrast on TEE were observed after ablation in 80 percent of those with persistent flutter but in none with paroxysmal atrial flutter, suggesting that, like AF, left atrial stunning in atrial flutter is related to the duration of the arrhythmia and not the mode of reversion. These changes resolved after three weeks of sustained sinus rhythm.

This recommendation also applies to patients with atrial flutter who have a prior history of AF.
