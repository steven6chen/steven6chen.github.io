Yearly prevalence rates for episodic TTH are approximately 80 percent in men and women. Due to its high prevalence in the population, TTH causes a high degree of disability. Despite its frequency, few placebo-controlled preventive therapeutic trials have been conducted in TTH. Different methods for efficacy measurement characterize these trials, making it difficult to compare results among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. More research in the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of TTH is urgently needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The available, proven, and speculative preventive therapies of TTH in adults are reviewed here. Acute treatment of TTH in adults is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Acute treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other aspects of TTH are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preventive therapy of TTH ranges from drugs to nonpharmacologic therapies such as behavioral and cognitive interventions. The goals of preventive therapy in TTH are reasonably extrapolated from those devised for migraine headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve responsiveness to treatment of acute attacks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve function and reduce disability</p><p/><p>Prophylactic headache treatment is indicated if the headaches are frequent, long lasting, or account for a significant amount of total disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With respect to TTH, both the frequent episodic subtype (1 to 14 headache days a month) and chronic subtype (&ge;15 headache days a month) warrant prevention as they may be associated with significant disability, especially when accompanied by migraine, comorbid depression, or anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Therefore, preventive treatment is appropriate for most patients with chronic TTH, and is probably appropriate for many patients with frequent episodic TTH. Frequent TTH may be difficult to treat, but an acceptable result can usually be obtained by a combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast, patients with infrequent episodic TTH (headache &lt;1 day per month) do not require preventive treatment.</p><p>Preventive therapy may be also indicated when acute therapy fails or is inappropriate because of inadequate response, adverse events, overuse, or contraindications.</p><p>To achieve benefit, prophylactic headache therapy requires a sustained commitment on the part of the patient and clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is important to address patient expectations and consider patient preferences when deciding between different preventive therapies. In addition, the patient should be informed of the rationale for a particular treatment, the expected benefits of therapy, the duration of treatment that will likely be needed to achieve improvement, and the possible and likely side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of pharmacologic therapies have been studied for the prophylactic treatment of TTH, as discussed in the sections that follow. Evidence of efficacy is limited and inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but perhaps is strongest for the tricyclic antidepressants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>. Other medications that may be useful include the antidepressants <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, the anticonvulsants <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and the muscle relaxant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a>. In contrast, the available evidence suggests that the selective serotonin uptake inhibitors are not effective for TTH prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tricyclic antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supporting evidence that tricyclics are beneficial for TTH comes from a 2010 meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] that evaluated nine small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/7-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-15</a>] of tricyclics for the treatment of TTH, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> the sole tricyclic tested in six of the trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Tricyclics significantly reduced the number of days with TTH compared with placebo (average standardized mean difference -1.29, 95% CI -2.18 to -0.39) and were more likely to reduce the intensity of headache by at least 50 percent compared with placebo (relative risk [RR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.02-1.89) or compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.34-2.22). In addition, the effectiveness of tricyclics seemed to increase over time.</p><p>However, a 2010 systematic review of prophylactic drugs for TTH in adults concluded that tricyclics and antidepressants in general were no more effective than placebo for prophylaxis in TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A meta-analysis was precluded by the high degree of heterogeneity of the included trials.</p><p>Tricyclic antidepressants are reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and noradrenaline, and these neurotransmitter interactions are the presumed mechanism of action for this class of drugs. Negative data regarding SSRIs suggest that other potential mechanisms, including inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake and antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, may be more likely to mediate the analgesic effect of tricyclics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> also reduces pericranial muscle tenderness, leading to peripheral antinociception and inhibition of central sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Patients should be informed that amitriptyline is an antidepressant agent but has an independent action on pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The beneficial effect for TTH is not related to the presence of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>We suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> for patients with frequent episodic TTH or chronic TTH. Exceptions include patients with obesity, bipolar disease, or cardiac conduction defects. This recommendation is best suited for patients who have a preference for pharmacologic treatment rather than behavioral or other nonpharmacologic therapies. Our recommendation is in agreement with 2010 guidelines from the European Federation of Neurological Societies for the treatment of TTH, which conclude that amitriptyline has a clinically relevant prophylactic effect in patients with chronic TTH and should be the drug of first choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>It is difficult to reach firm conclusions on the relative efficacy of tricyclics versus other treatment modalities as there are relatively few comparative trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The utility of combined tricyclic and behavioral therapy for the treatment of chronic TTH is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Combined behavioral and tricyclic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing and duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the following principles to guide preventive drug therapy for TTH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start the drug at the lowest dose, and increase the dose gradually until therapeutic benefit is achieved, the maximum dose of the drug is reached, or side effects become intolerable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give the prophylactic medication an adequate trial in terms of duration and dosage. Benefit is often first noted only after four to six weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>]. In addition, benefit may continue to accrue for three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid overuse of analgesic medications. Ongoing analgesic overuse must be eliminated, or preventive therapy will likely be ineffective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure the effectiveness of therapy by use of a patient headache diary to track daily headache frequency and intensity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once effective, maintain drug therapy for at least three to six months. Thereafter, a slow taper off the medication can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>With these principles in mind, we start <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> at 10 to 12.5 mg nightly and increase the dose in 10 to 12.5 mg steps every two to three weeks as tolerated and as needed for sleep, until there is improvement in headache or until a maximum dose of 100 to 125 mg nightly is reached. </p><p>It is common for practitioners to initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> at 25 mg each night and increase the dose in 25 mg increments each week, but in the author's clinical experience, such a regimen is complicated by increased side effects and reduced adherence compared with the one outlined above.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nortriptyline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protriptyline</a> can be considered as alternative tricyclics if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> is poorly tolerated. The effects of these tricyclic medications on sleep, anxiety disorders, and body weight can guide the choice among them.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> is the most sedating, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> is mild to moderately sedating, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protriptyline</a> is nonsedating and may be somewhat stimulating in some. Thus, protriptyline should be used cautiously for patients who have anxiety and panic disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> can cause weight gain, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protriptyline</a> may cause weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nortriptyline</a> is manufactured in capsules only and therefore is initiated and titrated in 10 or 25mg increments (the same doses as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>), but it can usually be increased on a weekly basis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Protriptyline</a> is usually started at 5 mg each morning and increased in 5 mg increments every week with a target dose of 20 mg each morning.</p><p>Tricyclic medications are associated with an increased risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias. Before initiating treatment with any of the cyclic antidepressants, patients should be screened for cardiac conduction system disease, which precludes the use of these medications. We and others suggest that patients age 40 years and older have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) for this purpose. Patients younger than age 40 can be screened by history for evidence of cardiac disease. They do not require an ECG if the history is negative. Patients who have a normal ECG before starting a tricyclic antidepressant do not need additional ECG monitoring while on the antidepressant, unless symptoms arise suggestive of cardiac toxicity.

In addition, mirtazapine treatment was associated with statistically significant reductions in headache intensity, duration, and frequency.<br/><br/>More patients treated with mirtazapine had sedation, dizziness, and weight gain than did patients receiving placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, weight gain is a known side effect of mirtazapine, and the short duration of the trial may explain why the relationship did not achieve statistical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 12-week trial involving 60 patients with TTH and more than five headaches a month at entry, treatment with extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> (150 mg daily) was associated with a statistically significant reduction in days with headache, the primary outcome measure, compared with placebo (45 percent reduction versus 16 percent increase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups on any of the secondary outcome measures.

The 2010 European guidelines consider mirtazapine and venlafaxine to be drugs of second choice for the prophylactic treatment of chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Available evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are <strong>not</strong> effective for the treatment of TTH in patients without depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
