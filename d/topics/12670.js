The exact incidence of CTEPH is unknown, but several series suggest that it occurs in 0.57 to 3.8 percent of survivors of acute pulmonary embolism and in over 10 percent of those with recurrent pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Patients with untreated CTEPH are likely to develop progressive disease and have a high risk of dying from right heart failure; therefore virtually all patients should receive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study, a mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;30 mmHg (3.99 kPa) appeared to be a threshold value portending a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Surgery is the only definitive therapy for CTEPH. Medical therapy is not curative and its effects are relatively modest; therefore, it is indicated in only a few situations.</p><p>The approach to the treatment of CTEPH is reviewed here. The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and administration and outcomes of surgical and medical therapy are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: Surgical treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-medical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: Medical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19764128\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the management of CTEPH is the initiation of anticoagulant therapy. The purpose of anticoagulant therapy is to prevent both recurrent venous thromboembolism and in situ pulmonary artery thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Anticoagulant therapy is initiated using intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. Once the patient is fully anticoagulated with one of these agents, they can be transitioned to an oral anticoagulant, the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>There are no studies comparing indefinite anticoagulant therapy to either no therapy or a shorter duration of therapy in patients with CTEPH. However, the usual approach to anticoagulant therapy in patients with CTEPH is based upon clinical experience, as well as the extrapolation of data from patients with a single or recurrent acute pulmonary embolism. In such patients, prolonged therapy is associated with fewer recurrent emboli than a shorter duration therapy according to randomized trials, and this effect appears to be larger than the increased risk of bleeding as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thromboembolism-initiation-of-anticoagulation-first-10-days\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thromboembolism: Initiation of anticoagulation (first 10 days)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thromboembolism-anticoagulation-after-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thromboembolism: Anticoagulation after initial management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rationale and indications for indefinite anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19764309\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR PULMONARY THROMBOENDARTERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step after the initiation of anticoagulant therapy is the evaluation of all patients with CTEPH for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Surgery is the only definitive therapy for CTEPH and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is the surgical procedure of choice. The evaluation should occur even if the symptoms, hemodynamic abnormalities, or ventilatory impairment seem mild because early surgery may prevent development of an irreversible vasculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The decision to proceed to pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is based upon four criteria: the surgical accessibility of the thrombi; the presence of hemodynamic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventilatory impairment; the impact of the patient's comorbidities on the risks of the surgery; and the willingness and motivation of the patient to undergo surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19764466\"><span class=\"h2\">Accessibility of the thrombi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is only able to remove thromboemboli whose proximal location is in the main, lobar, or segmental arteries. Thromboemboli that begin more distally cannot be removed by thromboendarterectomy.</p><p>Patients who are being considered for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy typically undergo pulmonary angiography which has been considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; in defining the extent and location of the thromboembolic obstruction. Technical advances in computed tomography (CT) such as electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated multi-detector CT angiography (MD-CTA) and 320-slice CT, suggest that CT may play an increasing future role in this phase of the preoperative evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Once the distribution of the thromboemboli has been determined, the clinician must decide whether proximal (ie, operable) thromboemboli make up a large enough proportion of the total thromboemboli that resection is likely to decrease the pulmonary vascular resistance. If most of the thromboemboli are distal (ie, inoperable) or an irreversible vasculopathy exists, resection of the proximal thromboemboli may not lower pulmonary vascular resistance.</p><p>This is an important decision because the outcomes are related to decreasing the pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>]. Outcomes are favorable when the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases; in contrast, failure of the pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease following pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is associated with poor outcomes, such as an inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass, early postoperative hemodynamic instability, early postoperative death, and poor long-term outcomes, particularly among patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>].</p><p>The decision regarding thromboendarterectomy should be undertaken at specialized centers by clinicians familiar with the disease process and its management to assure that potentially operable patients are not deemed inoperable. Objective approaches to determining the proportion of proximal and distal disease (ie, pulmonary artery occlusion waveform analysis) have been studied, but are not routinely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19764473\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic or ventilatory impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients being considered for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy undergo right heart catheterization.

Occasional patients can have significant exercise impairment due to increased dead space and high minute ventilation requirements without substantially altered pulmonary hemodynamics, especially those in which only one main pulmonary artery is involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19764480\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbid conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of comorbid conditions is not an absolute contraindication to pulmonary thromboendarterectomy; however, the increased risks imposed by coexisting conditions on both perioperative and long-term outcomes should be carefully reviewed with the patient before the decision is made to proceed to surgery.

Multiple separate BPA procedures were performed in each patient to reduce the risk of reperfusion injury; the average was four procedures per patient (range two to eight). The World Health Organization functional class improved from 3 to 2 (p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62080 \">table 1</a>), and mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 45.4 &plusmn; 9.6 to 24 &plusmn; 6.4 mmHg (5.99 to 3.19 kPa).

This applies to those patients in whom surgery is not possible due to a personal choice, the anatomic distribution of their disease, the extent of their disease, or their comorbidities. Medical therapy is not curative and its effects are relatively modest; therefore, it is indicated in only a few special situations. Medical therapy, other than anticoagulation, is not routinely indicated prior to pulmonary thromboendarterectomy although reports suggest it is being increasingly utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1,2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,24</a>]. A retrospective analysis revealed medical therapy resulted in a minimal effect on pre-thromboendarterectomy hemodynamics, no effect on post-thromboendarterectomy hemodynamics, and a significant delay in time to referral for the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The only exceptions are that it is occasionally used as a bridge to surgical therapy when profound right ventricular failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe pulmonary hypertension are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
