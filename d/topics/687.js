The most common ambulatory ECG application is in the diagnosis and assessment of cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or the presence of potential arrhythmias (such as in patients with syncope or presyncope), but ambulatory ECG also has a role in the assessment of prognosis and risk stratification of various cardiac populations, in the evaluation of arrhythmia therapy, and for the evaluation of silent ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Silent myocardial ischemia: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of heart rate variability&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Ambulatory ECG monitoring, which can be performed using a variety of techniques for as short as 24 to 48 hours and for as long as months to years, offers the opportunity to review cardiac ECG data during normal routine activity, including any physical and psychological stresses. Ambulatory ECG monitoring for longer periods (when compared with standard ECG for a 10-second time period) is more sensitive for detecting spontaneous, often highly variable cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Ambulatory monitoring, in conjunction with clinical and electrocardiographic findings, can be a useful component of the evaluation of the patient with unexplained syncope, presyncope, or palpitations. A detailed discussion of the evaluation of syncope and palpitations, including the role of ambulatory monitors, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-palpitations-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of palpitations in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605777690\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulatory ECG monitoring is the most widely employed technology to evaluate a patient with symptoms suggestive of a cardiac arrhythmia or a conduction abnormality.

Continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring for 24 to 48 hours is most practical as the initial monitor for patients with daily or near daily symptoms, while those with less frequent symptoms are more likely to benefit from extended ambulatory ECG monitoring with an event monitor or an implantable loop recorder. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types of ambulatory ECG monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H605778078\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to choosing an ambulatory ECG monitoring strategy'</a> below.) </p><p>In addition to being used for the evaluation of patients with unexplained symptoms suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia, ambulatory ECG monitor may also be used to evaluate the efficacy of therapy or for prognostic purposes.

Continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitoring includes a continuous recording of all electrocardiographic data for a period of 24 or 48 hours. This technology uses a small, lightweight, battery operated recorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105244 \">figure 1</a>) that typically records two or three channels of electrocardiographic data (although 12-lead monitors are also available) from electrodes placed on the patient's chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitoring devices have patient-activated event markers, and encoded time or time markers. The recorded data are analyzed with a playback instrument system that requires operator interaction with an arrhythmia analyzer, ST segment detector, RR interval analysis, signal-averaging computer, and a variety of audiovisual detection and review displays, as well as a printer for generating printouts of ECGs, trends, or a statistical summary. These devices must be returned for analysis and, as such, do not provide real-time information on patient symptoms or arrhythmias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605777887\"><span class=\"h3\">Holter monitor report</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical Holter monitor report includes the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total heart beats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average heart rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum and minimum heart rates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of premature beats (supraventricular and ventricular)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of tachyarrhythmia and the etiology of the arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular or ventricular)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longest R-R interval and any pauses greater than three seconds and etiology of the pauses (eg, sinus pauses versus AV block)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient-reported symptoms and any associated ECG findings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Representative samples of the ECG tracing itself (eg, hourly samples)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Event (loop) monitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Event monitors, historically called loop monitors because the recording device continuously looped its recording tape, are most commonly used for patients with less frequent (ie, weekly to monthly) symptoms of palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. Typically utilized for two to four weeks (although possibly up to three months), event monitors are small, lightweight devices carried by the patient with electrodes to be applied when symptoms arise. Alternatively, event monitors may be worn continuously and activated by patient trigger when symptoms arise.</p><p>Real-time continuous attended cardiac monitoring systems represent the newest form of event monitors developed to combine the benefits and overcome the limitations of Holter and standard event monitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. They are worn continuously and are similar in size to the traditional event monitor, although some of the newest devices are self-contained within an electrode patch that is disposable following its use. These devices automatically record and transmit arrhythmic event data from an ambulatory patient to an attended monitoring station. Data can also be recorded through patient-triggered activation.</p><p>This technology is ideal for patients who have intermittent or rare symptoms since the device may be carried for long periods of time and electrocardiographic data can be recorded during symptomatic episodes (although it requires that the patient not be incapacitated during or immediately after the episode and have a reasonable amount of physical dexterity to apply the device). Furthermore, because these instruments have the ECG in continuous memory before activation, they are excellent for documenting transient symptomatic or incapacitating events, and displaying the antecedent onset and subsequent offset of a paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The ECG data from event monitors are most commonly received at a base station equipped with a demodulator and an ECG strip chart recorder. Trained staff analyze live incoming patient data and can contact the patient's clinician if instructed to do so according to a prespecified set of rules provided by the clinician.</p><p>A permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator can also be used as a continuous monitoring device as these devices have built-in algorithms for recognizing tachyarrhythmias. The devices can be interrogated to obtain data about arrhythmia frequency, duration, and atrial and ventricular rates.

ILRs are most commonly utilized in the evaluation of palpitations or syncope of undetermined etiology, particularly when symptoms are infrequent (eg, less than once per month) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other ambulatory monitoring has been unrevealing or inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These devices are typically implanted in the left pectoral region and store events when the device is activated automatically according to programmed criteria or manually with magnet application. A newer version of the ILR enables more continuous rhythm monitoring via daily transmission of telemetric data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In one cohort of 157 patients with at least one episode of unexplained syncope who received an ILR, 70 (45 percent) were followed for greater than 18 months, some as long as four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Twenty-six percent of all diagnoses made in this cohort occurred more than 18 months following ILR implantation, indicating the utility of continued ILR monitoring in patients without a definitive diagnosis for their unexplained syncope.</p><p>Among patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, an ILR may more accurately establish a causative relationship between bradyarrhythmias and syncope than provocative tests (eg, upright tilt table testing or adenosine 5'-triphosphate [ATP] infusion).

Among 273 patients enrolled in a nonrandomized trial (151 patients) and an ILR registry (122 patients), device infections were noted in only four patients (1.5 percent), and serious adverse events (defined as procedure-related adverse events leading to death or serious deterioration in health) were noted in only three patients (1.1 percent) with no associated deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605777911\"><span class=\"h3\">ILR report</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical implantable loop recorder report includes the following information: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG tracings for each patient-triggered (or auto-triggered) event</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technician's interpretation of the tracing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reported symptoms and their duration</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ECG rhythm recorded using any ambulatory ECG monitoring modality must be correlated with the simultaneous occurrence of suggestive symptoms. Without this correlation, the detected rhythm abnormality is unlikely to be clinically important. Bradycardia and sinus pauses are particularly common at night while the patient is asleep, as a result of enhanced vagal tone. Thus, the occurrence of such arrhythmias does not necessarily establish a causal mechanism for a transient disturbance in consciousness or for other symptoms. </p><p>Among patients evaluated with 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, approximately 25 to 50 percent of patients will experience a symptom, between 2 and 15 percent will have an associated causal arrhythmia, and 35 percent will report symptoms without associated arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Extending the period of monitoring can increase the incidence of symptomatic events to approximately 50 percent at three days and 75 percent at 5 to 21 days (mean 9 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic value of ambulatory monitoring seems to depend upon a number of variables:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalized patients with symptoms are more likely to have a causal arrhythmia. In one study, which included 306 hospitalized patients and 278 outpatients, symptoms occurred far more frequently in the outpatients (55 versus 6 percent); however, symptomatic inpatients were significantly more likely to have symptoms that correlated with causal arrhythmias (95 versus 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presenting symptom also may predict the findings of ambulatory ECG. In one report of 1010 hospitalized patients, those with syncope had a consistently higher rate of diary maintenance, of reporting symptoms during ambulatory ECG, and of a conclusive examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p>When an implantable loop recorder (ILR) is implanted in patients with syncope of uncertain cause, transient bradycardia is frequently found to be responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. In the largest study of ILR use in the evaluation of patients with syncope of uncertain cause (The Place of Reveal In the Care pathway and Treatment of patients with Unexplained Recurrent Syncope, PICTURE registry) an ILR was implanted in 570 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients were followed for at least one year or until their next syncopal episode (mean of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 6 months). Recurrent syncope was noted in 218 patients (38 percent). Data acquired by the ILR during the syncopal event directly contributed to a diagnosis in 78 percent of patients. A cardiac etiology was found in 75 percent; however, a breakdown of specific cardiac arrhythmias noted on the ILR was not reported.

However, an ILR can be an extremely useful test for patients with infrequent (ie, less than monthly) symptoms that are potentially injurious to the patient or others (eg, syncope). ILR can also be useful for patients with bothersome symptoms requiring a diagnosis but whose prior assessments with Holter and event monitoring have been unrevealing of a diagnosis. ILR may also be helpful when searching for asymptomatic occult episodes of atrial fibrillation, such as following a cryptogenic stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke#H24817210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H688185183\"><span class=\"h2\">Other scenarios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, clinical circumstances will arise in which ambulatory ECG monitoring is not the optimal initial test. Generally, if the patient has severe or potentially life-threatening symptoms (eg, syncope or presyncope with associated injury, sustained lightheadedness, etc), admission to the hospital for continuous in-hospital telemetry is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167379341\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AFTER AMBULATORY ECG MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the diagnostic monitoring period, there are three possible combinations of patient symptoms and ECG findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient had <strong>symptoms with corresponding ECG abnormalities</strong> (ie, arrhythmia or conduction abnormality) &ndash; Such patients should be treated appropriately and, in most instances, do not require additional ambulatory ECG monitoring for diagnostic purposes (although additional monitoring to assess the efficacy of therapy may be indicated in some patients). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient had <strong>symptoms without corresponding ECG abnormalities</strong> (ie, arrhythmia or conduction abnormality) &ndash; In such instances, assuming that the monitor was functioning properly and the available ECG data are interpretable, the diagnosis is likely non-cardiac and there is generally no need for additional ambulatory ECG monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient had <strong>no symptoms and no ECG abnormalities</strong> during the monitoring period &ndash; The decision to pursue additional testing following a period of ambulatory ECG monitoring depends on the potential severity of the clinical conditions. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A patient who experiences only infrequent palpitations who had an unremarkable four-week event monitor can usually be managed conservatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conversely, a patient who has suffered syncope (particularly abrupt syncope without warning symptoms that resulted in injury) but who did not have recurrent symptoms or ECG abnormalities during the initial monitoring should usually proceed with prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3977540684\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ambulatory ECG monitoring is the most widely employed technology to evaluate a patient with symptoms suggestive of a cardiac arrhythmia or a conduction abnormality (ie, unexplained <span class=\"nowrap\">syncope/near</span> syncope or unexplained palpitations), but it is also used for a variety of other diagnostic and prognostic indications. (See <a href=\"#H605777690\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ambulatory ECG monitoring is available in many forms, including continuous (Holter) monitoring for 24 to 48 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105244 \">figure 1</a>), event (loop) monitoring for several weeks, or implantable loop recording (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104724 \">picture 1</a>) for months to years. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types of ambulatory ECG monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ECG rhythm recorded using any ambulatory ECG monitoring modality must be correlated with the simultaneous occurrence of suggestive symptoms. Without this correlation, the detected rhythm abnormality is unlikely to be clinically important. Bradycardia and sinus pauses are particularly common at night while the patient is asleep, as a result of enhanced vagal tone. Thus, the occurrence of such arrhythmias does not necessarily establish a causal mechanism for a transient disturbance in consciousness or for other symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to choosing an ambulatory ECG monitoring strategy depends on the indication for the test along with the frequency and duration of symptoms. If an ambulatory ECG monitor is being used for diagnostic purposes (ie, unexplained syncope or unexplained palpitations), extended duration monitoring may be required to increase the likelihood of making a diagnosis. Conversely, when ambulatory ECG monitoring is performed to assess the effect of therapy (eg, rate control in atrial fibrillation) or for prognostic assessment, continuous ECG monitoring for 24 to 48 hours is usually adequate. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H605778078\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to choosing an ambulatory ECG monitoring strategy'</a> above.) </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-ecg-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Boudoulas H, Schaal SF, Lewis RP, Robinson JL.
