A differential diagnosis is formulated based on those results and additional testing is performed to narrow the diagnostic possibilities.</p><p>Although the evaluation is usually not urgent, jaundice can reflect a medical emergency in a few situations. These include massive hemolysis (eg, due to <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> sepsis or falciparum malaria), ascending cholangitis, and fulminant hepatic failure.

Although rare, it can also be seen in the acute cholestatic phase of viral hepatitis and in prolonged near-complete common bile duct obstruction from cancer of the pancreatic head or the duodenal ampulla.</p><p/><p>The physical examination may reveal a Courvoisier sign (a palpable gallbladder, caused by obstruction distal to the takeoff of the cystic duct by malignancy) or signs of chronic liver <span class=\"nowrap\">failure/portal</span> hypertension such as ascites, splenomegaly, spider angiomata, and gynecomastia. Certain findings suggest specific diseases, such as hyperpigmentation in hemochromatosis, Kayser-Fleischer rings in Wilson disease, and xanthomas in primary biliary cholangitis.

The presence or absence of abnormalities and the type of abnormalities should help to distinguish the various causes of jaundice.

As an example, viral hepatitis, which normally presents primarily with an elevation of serum aminotransferases, may present as a predominantly cholestatic syndrome with marked pruritus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58687111\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferases are normal, the jaundice is likely not due to hepatic injury or biliary tract disease. In such patients, hemolysis or inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism may be responsible for the hyperbilirubinemia. The inherited disorders associated with isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are Gilbert and Crigler-Najjar syndromes; the disorders associated with isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are Rotor and Dubin-Johnson syndromes.

Increased serum alkaline phosphatase is also found in granulomatous liver diseases, such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. These conditions may or may not be associated with jaundice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19404964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Elevated alkaline phosphatase'</a>.)<br/></p><p>An elevation in the serum alkaline phosphatase concentration can also be derived from extrahepatic tissues, particularly bone. Extrahepatic disorders do not cause jaundice except in rare cases, such as bone tumors metastasizing to the liver. If necessary, the serum activities of the canalicular enzymes gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and 5'-nucleotidase can be measured to confirm the hepatic origin of alkaline phosphatase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78223\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78223 \">algorithm 3</a>).

The AST elevation is usually less than eight times the upper limit of normal, and the ALT elevation is typically less than five times the upper limit of normal. The AST to ALT ratio is usually greater than 2.0, a value rarely seen in other forms of liver disease.

In a patient with a history consistent with Gilbert syndrome (eg, the development of jaundice during times of stress) additional testing is not required. If this initial evaluation is negative and the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia persists, other causes should be sought (eg, Crigler-Najjar syndrome).

If imaging is negative, the evaluation typically will also include obtaining an antimitochondrial antibody to evaluate for primary biliary cholangitis.
