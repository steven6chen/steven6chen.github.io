A breast mass may be benign or malignant. A benign mass may be solid or cystic, whereas a malignant mass is typically solid. A cystic mass with solid components (complex cyst) can also be malignant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H100220398\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cysts: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Complex cyst'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1656472\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1657319\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of a palpable breast mass is variable. Some masses are detected on a patient's self-breast examination while others are found on a routine clinical breast examination. Some masses may be associated with pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nipple discharge (eg, blood, green, white, yellow) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>Trauma to the breast (eg, car accident with seat belt, direct injury from a hard object) may result in a breast mass due to the development of fat necrosis or a hematoma. In addition, trauma may be the precipitating event to detection of an existing benign or malignant mass. Any mass after a trauma that fails to resolve will require a complete evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;, section on 'Fat necrosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1658833\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of patients with benign breast disease parallels the examination of patients with cancer, since normal breast tissue in women is often somewhat nodular. The first goal of the physical examination is to determine whether a dominant mass, thickening, or asymmetry is present. This is particularly important in younger women, whose breasts are more likely to be generally nodular than in older women. In a retrospective review of 605 women under the age of 40 years who were referred to a breast clinic for evaluation of a breast mass, a dominant mass was palpated by the surgeon in 36 percent of self-detected masses (n = 484) and 29 percent of physician-detected masses (n = 121) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>On the physical examination, the palpable breast mass can be obvious or subtle; the density soft, firm, or hard; mobile or fixed to the chest wall or skin; tender or nontender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mass may have well-defined or nondiscrete margins and be associated with clinical findings including ecchymosis, erythema, peau d'orange, or ulceration of the skin; nipple discharge, nipple retraction; or the mass may have no associated clinical findings. However, the physical examination findings cannot always distinguish between a benign mass and a malignancy, even for clinical experts, as the findings may be subtle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer#H1749806644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Studies that have examined the usefulness of the physical examination for diagnosing benign versus malignant breast masses have found that clinicians can often make the right diagnosis, but not to a degree that is sufficiently reassuring to the clinician or patient. In one report, from a study of symptomatic women, experienced examiners who diagnosed &quot;definite cancer&quot; on palpation were correct in 93 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another series, the physical examination had a positive predictive value of 73 percent and a negative predictive value of 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1656600\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic imaging findings of a palpable breast mass include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mammogram depicts a mass as a soft tissue density. The density may have discrete or irregular spiculated margins or demonstrate architectural distortion and, in some clinical settings, can also be associated with gross or microscopic calcifications. While a mammogram can depict a mass that is abnormal or suspicious for breast cancer, the imaging study cannot make a definitive diagnosis. In addition, not all palpable masses can be imaged by mammography, such as those in premenopausal women with dense breast tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further discussion on mammographic imaging is reviewed separately.

The breast examination is best performed when hormonal stimulation of the breasts is minimized, which is usually seven to nine days after the onset of menses in premenopausal women. The evaluation of a clinically suspicious mass should not be influenced by the phase of the menstrual cycle. The timing of the breast examination is not important in postmenopausal women, or premenopausal women who are taking birth control pills or other treatments that affect ovarian suppression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1658001\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be examined in both the upright and supine positions. The patient must be disrobed from the waist up, allowing the examiner to visualize and inspect the breasts. The breast examination is started with the patient in a seated position with her arms relaxed. The patient is then asked to raise her arms over her head so the lower part of the breasts can be inspected. Finally, the patient should put her hands on her hips and press in to contract the pectoral muscles so that any other areas of retraction can be visualized. Inspection of the breast includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetry &ndash; Observe the breast outline and contour for any bulging areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes &ndash; Check for dimpling or retraction, edema, ulceration, erythema, or eczematous appearance, such as scaly, thickened, raw skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nipples &ndash; Assess for symmetry, inversion or retraction, nipple discharge or crusting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1658007\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After careful inspection, proceed with the palpation of regional lymph nodes and the breasts.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional lymph node examination &ndash; While the patient is sitting, the regional lymph nodes are examined, with attention to the cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary nodal basins. The best examination of the axillary nodes requires that the patient relax her shoulders and allow the examiner to support her arm while the axilla is palpated. It is important to note the presence of any palpable nodes and their characteristics, whether they are soft and mobile or firm, hard, tender, fixed, or matted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61035\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61035 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast examination &ndash; A bimanual examination of the breasts is performed while the patient is still in the sitting position, supporting the breast gently with one hand and examining the breast with the other hand. The examination is completed with the patient in a supine position, with the ipsilateral arm raised above her head. This allows the examiner to flatten the breast tissue against the patient's chest. It is sometimes useful to have the patient roll onto her contralateral hip to flatten the lateral part of the breast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The entire breast must be examined, including the breast tissue that comprises the axillary tail of Spence, which extends laterally toward the axilla. To be sure that all breast tissue is included in the examination, it is best to cover a rectangular area bordered by the clavicle superiorly, the midsternum medially, the midaxillary line laterally, and the lower rib cage inferiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61035\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61035 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p/><p>The examination technique should be systematic, using concentric circles, a radial approach, or vertical strips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Palpation should be done with the finger pads rather than the fingertips. Circular motions with light, medium, and deep pressure ensure palpation of all levels of breast tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. One hand stabilizes the breast while the other hand is used to perform the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1658013\"><span class=\"h3\">Documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location of the mass as well as any abnormality found on examination should be accurately documented. The size of any mass should be measured in centimeters and its location, mobility, and consistency recorded. It is helpful to record the location of any abnormality by documenting both the position on the breast and the distance in centimeters from the areola. In this manner, the precise location can be easily identified on subsequent follow-up examinations, by the initial examiner as well as other practitioners. </p><p>The &quot;clock&quot; system can be used for documentation, comparing the breast to a clock and using the location on the clock to indicate the location of a lesion (eg, 1 o'clock position). The entire examination should be clearly and completely documented in detail, including significant negatives, even if it is completely normal. Distance from the radial edge of the areola can be used to document location of the mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnostic mammogram is the first imaging study performed for a woman with a new, palpable breast mass and should be performed even if a recent mammogram was negative.

Targeted ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic test to evaluate a palpable mass and is frequently ordered concurrent with the mammogram. It is particularly useful for assessing whether a mass is solid or cystic in nature.

Either a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy or core biopsy can be employed. However, successful FNA requires experienced cytopathologists, as invasive cancers may not be differentiated from noninvasive cancers. In institutions where experienced cytopathologists are not available, the initial diagnostic procedure of choice should be core needle biopsy (CNB) rather than FNA. Another advantage of the CNB is that sufficient tissue can usually be obtained for hormone receptor analysis. Very few breast cancers are missed using the triple test.

A study using the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registry compared cancer detection rates and stage for patients with short-interval follow-up (three to eight months) with those who returned to routine screening (9 to 18 months) following benign core breast biopsy (stereotactic or ultrasonography-guided) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A total of 17,631 biopsies with benign findings were identified. Similar rates of later cancer were detected for the short interval follow-up and routine screening groups with no significant differences in stage, tumor size, or nodal status. Thus, it may be safe for those with a benign radiologic-pathologic-concordant percutaneous breast biopsy to return to routine screening; however, the study did not identify the spatial relationship between the finding that prompted the initial biopsy and the site of the subsequent cancer (which could have represented a false negative result).

However, the breast tissue tends to be more diffuse and tender, and generally does not form a discrete or well-defined mass. Most patients present with breast pain that may be cyclical or constant, bilateral or unilateral or focal. The breast tissue, particularly in the upper outer quadrants, may increase in size prior to the onset of menses, then return to baseline after the onset of the menstrual flow.

The characteristics of the mass to be evaluated include density (such as soft, hard, firm), skin changes, nipple areolar changes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fixation to the chest wall. (See <a href=\"#H1657319\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies of a breast mass include mammography, which depicts a mass as a soft tissue density with sharp or spiculated margins. An ultrasound documents if the mass is solid or cystic and the character of the margins and presence of a blood supply. Not all palpable masses can be imaged by mammography, such as for women with dense breast tissue. (See <a href=\"#H1656600\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic history, including risk factors for breast cancer, and physical examination are performed for every woman who presents with a new breast mass. Diagnostic evaluation includes radiographic imaging and, frequently, a breast biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H1656614\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all women with a suspicious breast mass, a mammogram is the first diagnostic test performed. Frequently, an ultrasound is also performed concurrently as a component of the evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for diagnostic dilemmas. Breast masses in young women (under age 30 years) that are clinically consistent with a benign lesion, such as a fibroadenoma, and in whom there is no family history of breast cancer, can be first imaged by an ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive diagnosis of a breast mass is made by a breast biopsy, which includes a fine needle aspiration, core biopsy, or an open biopsy. We prefer a core biopsy that can provide sufficient tissue for differentiation between invasive and noninvasive cancers as well as provide sufficient tissue for hormone receptor analysis.
