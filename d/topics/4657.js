The primary area of injury is within the alveolar wall. </p><p>In addition to the cryptogenic form, secondary organizing pneumonia can be seen in association with connective tissue diseases, a variety of drugs, malignancy, and other interstitial pneumonias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p>COP will be reviewed here. The other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and an approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in adults are discussed separately.

A cumulative incidence of six to seven cases per 100,000 hospital admissions was found at a major teaching hospital in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], while in a 20 year review of national statistics for Iceland, the mean annual incidence was 1.1 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In separate reports, approximately 56 to 68 percent of organizing pneumonia (OP) cases have been deemed cryptogenic rather than secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histopathologic lesions characteristic of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) include excessive proliferation of granulation tissue, which consists of loose collagen-embedded fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, involving alveolar ducts and alveoli, with or without bronchiolar intraluminal polyps. Intraluminal plugs of granulation tissue may extend from one alveolus to the adjacent one through the pores of Kohn, giving rise to the characteristic &quot;butterfly&quot; pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60476\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60476 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72270 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is thought that bronchiolar lesions reflect extension of intraluminal plugs of granulation tissue from alveolar sacs and ducts to the bronchioles. Other features include a uniform appearance within involved areas and a patchy distribution without severe disruption of the lung architecture. A morphologic variant with organizing airspace and airway granulation tissue leading to a dense mature eosinophilic scar tissue within the lumens of airways and airspaces has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. While the pathologic lesion is predominantly within the airspace, mild chronic inflammation (eg, lymphocytes and plasma cells) is present in the alveolar walls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81647\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81647 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>There are, in addition, other key histopathologic features that are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60654 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Histologic features of organizing pneumonia (OP) can also be seen in combination with other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68251 \">table 2</a>). However, the portion of changes suggestive of OP is small (&lt;10 percent) relative to the characteristic changes of these other interstitial pneumonias.

It is thought that organizing pneumonia is a consequence of alveolar epithelial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. The initial injury is followed by leakage of plasma proteins, recruitment of fibroblasts, and fibrin formation within the alveolar lumen. </p><p>Abnormal regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase has been reported in association with COP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, dysregulation of these proteins has been observed in a large number of other pulmonary diseases, and their precise role in the pathogenesis of COP remains speculative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Regulation of angiogenesis and apoptosis may influence the reversibility of the fibrotic lesions in COP, compared to the irreversible lesions in usual interstitial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/15,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,18</a>].</p><p>A potential link between organizing pneumonia and microaspiration of gastric secretions in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disease onset is typically in the fifth or sixth decades of life, with men and women affected equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/10,11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,20</a>]. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is only rarely reported in children. The reported frequency of current or past cigarette smoking ranges from 25 to 50 percent, making smoking unlikely to be a precipitating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/6,9,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>COP typically presents with cough, dyspnea, fever, and malaise that are of relatively short duration (eg, weeks to months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In one-half, the onset is heralded by the acute onset of a flu-like illness with fever, malaise, fatigue, and cough, but in other patients the onset of symptoms is less acute.

Furthermore, a mixed picture that includes features of organizing pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia may be seen, suggesting that CEP can transition to COP in some patients. The differentiation of these processes usually depends on the relative proportions of the histopathologic patterns and the response to systemic glucocorticoids.
