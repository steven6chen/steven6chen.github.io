These types of vaccines have no risk beyond what is encountered in immunocompetent individuals and may be given to immunodeficient patients when they offer possible benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Among those vaccines that are unlikely to be harmful, some are of particular importance to patients with certain PIDs because they are at increased risk for these infections, such as pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines in patients with complement deficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F110756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110756 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2035156881\"><span class=\"h3\">Live vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of live (also called live-attenuated) vaccines varies with the degree of immunodeficiency. In severe forms of PID, vaccination with live vaccines can cause disseminated infection. Vaccine-induced infection in patients with undiagnosed immunodeficiency has been reported with oral polio vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>], rotavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>], Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], varicella vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], and with measles from the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Beginning in 2000, oral polio vaccines were no longer licensed in the United States and Canada, although they are still used in other parts of the world.</p><p>In countries that are implementing newborn screening for immunodeficiency, infants with serious forms of PID should be detected before any live vaccines are given. The principal exception to this generalization occurs in countries where BCG vaccine is routinely administered before discharge from the hospital, which may occur before the results of newborn screening are available in some cases. In contrast, in countries without newborn screening programs, inadvertent administration to a newborn with PID remains a risk. Rotavirus vaccines should not be given to infants in the hospital or the nursery, because of possible spread to severely immunocompromised patients.

This category includes disorders caused by somatic mutations in genes, as well as disorders caused by autoantibodies to various cytokines, cell surface glycoproteins, or complement factors. The presence of autoantibodies to cytokines can result in immunodeficiency states similar to those caused by inherited defects in the affected pathways. Infections associated with these disorders are variable, as with defects of innate immunity, and similar considerations apply. For example, patients with autoantibodies to IFN-gamma are similar to those with Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) and should not receive live bacterial vaccines (BCG or <em>Salmonella</em> vaccine).
