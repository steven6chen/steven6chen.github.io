Although children with these anomalies are generally asymptomatic, some children develop symptoms due to complications, such as infection, renal calculi, and urinary obstruction.</p><p>Ectopic and fusion anomalies of the kidney with their associated complications will be reviewed here. An overview and the evaluation of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, including radiological investigations, are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL EMBRYOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal embryologic development of the kidney occurs in three stages; pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The last stage, the metanephros forms the permanent kidney and is first detected at five to six weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68500\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68500 \">figure 1</a>). The metanephros is composed of the metanephric mesenchyme and ureteral bud (caudal portion of the mesonephric duct).</p><p>The metanephros is initially positioned in the pelvis opposite the sacral somites. Rapid caudal growth results in the migration of the developing kidney from the pelvis to the retroperitoneal renal fossa, which lies on either side of the spine opposite the second lumbar vertebra. As each kidney ascends, it rotates through 90 degrees such that the renal hilum is directed medially as the kidney reaches its final position. Migration and rotation are completed by the eighth week of gestation.</p><p>The ascending kidney derives its vascular supply locally from neighboring vessels. As the kidneys reach their permanent position, renal arteries and veins develop and provide vascular support. As a result, ectopic kidneys usually contain numerous small vessels and reflect the continuous changes in blood supply of the developing kidneys during the course of renal ascent.</p><p>Positional (ectopy) and fusion anomalies occur when this normal embryogenic migration is disrupted and are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL ECTOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal ectopy occurs when the kidney does not normally ascend to the retroperitoneal renal fossa (level of the second lumbar vertebra). Simple congenital ectopy refers to a kidney that lies on the correct side of the body, but lies in an abnormal position. Kidneys that cross the midline are referred to as crossed renal ectopy. Crossed renal ectopy can occur with and without fusion to the contralateral kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60213\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60213 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Crossed fused ectopy'</a> below.)</p><p>Ectopic kidneys that do not ascend above the pelvic brim are commonly called pelvic kidneys. Rarely, the ectopic kidney is found in the thorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Bilateral renal ectopy has also been reported, but is a rare occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The ectopic kidney fails to rotate normally, resulting in a shift of the renal axis so that the renal pelvis is directed anteriorly rather than medially. The blood supply of the ectopic kidney is variable and may come from the iliac arteries, aorta, and at times, the hypogastric and middle sacral arteries.</p><p>The incidence of renal ectopy is reported as 1 in 1000 autopsies. A similar rate was reported in a study of 13,705 fetuses with antenatal ultrasounds performed in a tertiary center in Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, a study that screened 132,686 Taiwanese schoolchildren (6 to 15 years of age) found a lower incidence of 1 in 5000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, 30 cases of ectopic kidneys were detected by a &quot;quick&quot; screening renal ultrasound in 20 boys and 10 girls. Further imaging located the ectopic kidney in the lower lumbar region of 21 children, and in the pelvis and the thorax of five and two other children, respectively. The kidney crossed the midline in a further two children. This study may have underestimated the incidence of renal ectopy because of limitations of the screening technique used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings of renal ectopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with renal ectopy are asymptomatic. The diagnosis is often made coincidentally during routine antenatal or postnatal ultrasonography. This was illustrated in a case series of 99 children with renal ectopy, of whom 79 were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The diagnosis was made by either antenatal or postnatal ultrasonography.</p><p>In a fetus with normal amniotic fluid volume, the most likely cause of an absent kidney in the renal fossa is an ectopic kidney, as demonstrated in the previously mentioned retrospective review of 13,705 fetuses who had antenatal ultrasounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of 40 cases with an empty renal fossa identified, the underlying cause in 24 patients was renal ectopia, and unilateral renal agenesis and horseshoe kidney in 13 and 2, respectively. Crossed fused renal ectopy was detected in one patient. Thus, a finding of an empty renal fossa should direct the ultrasonographer to search for an ectopic kidney.</p><p>In patients diagnosed symptomatically, findings at presentation are generally related to associated complications, such as urinary tract infection, obstruction, and renal calculi. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, hematuria, or incontinence from an ectopic ureter. On examination, an abdominal mass may be palpable or hypertension detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the previously mentioned case series of 99 patients, at presentation, 12 of the 20 patients with symptomatic renal ectopy had signs of urinary tract infection, four had abdominal pain, two had a palpable abdominal mass, one had hematuria, and one was incontinent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The ectopic kidney generally has decreased function. As illustrated in the case series of 99 patients, decreased renal function was detected by 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in 74 of 82 cases of simple unilateral renal ectopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Rarely in female patients, persistent urinary incontinence characterized by continuous dampness of their underwear can be secondary to a small ectopic pelvic kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Renal sonogram may not be sensitive enough to identify the tiny ectopic kidney, which may be associated with compensatory hypertrophy of the normal contralateral kidney. A high clinical suspicion should initiate evaluation with a DMSA scan <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging urogram to look for a dilated ureter and associated ectopic renal nubbin. Laparoscopic removal will resolve the incontinence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Other anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high incidence of other urological abnormalities has been associated with renal ectopy. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. The following urological abnormalities were noted in the case series of 99 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VUR occurred in 20 percent of crossed renal ectopy, 30 percent of simple renal ectopy, and 70 percent of bilateral simple renal ectopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other genitourinary abnormalities included:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Contralateral renal dysplasia in four cases; three with multicystic dysplasia and one with renal agenesis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cryptorchidism in five cases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypospadias in five cases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hydronephrosis in three ectopic and eight contralateral kidneys; in one ectopic kidney, ureteropelvic obstruction was detected</p><p/><p>In girls, genital anomalies such as agenesis of the uterus and vagina (eg, m&uuml;llerian agenesis and Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] or unicornuate uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] have been associated with ectopic kidneys. In girls with uterovaginal atresia, there is often only a single ectopic kidney. In these patients as well as those with contralateral renal dysplasia, renal function is impaired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ectopic kidney can be associated with other nonrenal anomalies (adrenal, cardiac, and skeletal abnormalities) and as a clinical feature in syndromes such as CHARGE syndrome (coloboma, heart disease, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies) and VACTERL syndrome (vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheal, esophageal, renal, limb anomalies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Thoracic kidneys are often associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of renal ectopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once an ectopic kidney is detected, evaluation should include a careful physical examination for other anomalies.</p><p>Radiological testing is recommended to detect other urological abnormalities that impact renal function. Detailed descriptions of these studies including voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and dynamic (eg, such as technetium 99m-mercaptotriglycylglycine [Tc99mMAG3] and 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA]) and static renal scans are found separately.</p><p>Postnatal renal ultrasonography confirms the antenatal diagnosis of renal ectopy and defines the underlying anatomy, including the presence of hydronephrosis.</p><p>VCUG should be performed in patients with horseshoe kidney with a history of urinary tract infection because of the increased association with VUR. If VUR is detected, then prophylactic antibiotics should be considered, especially in patients who have a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.</p><p>A serum creatinine should be obtained to assess renal function in children with bilateral renal disease or progressive hydronephrosis.</p><p>In our practice, further evaluation is based upon the results of these three studies (postnatal ultrasound, VCUG, and serum creatinine) as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the patient with a normal-appearing contralateral kidney and no evidence of hydronephrosis in the ectopic kidney, no further evaluation is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum creatinine is elevated or if the contralateral kidney appears abnormal, a 99mTc-DMSA renal scan should be performed to assess the differential renal function of both kidneys. In patients with decreased renal function, urologic or nephrologic consultation should be sought.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is severe hydronephrosis and the VCUG examination is normal, then a diuretic renogram with (99mTc)-mercaptotriglycylglycine (MAG-3) or technetium 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) should be performed to detect obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the hydronephrosis is mild or moderate and the VCUG examination is normal, then follow-up ultrasonography should be performed three to six months later. If there is progressive hydronephrosis, then a MAG-3 or DTPA diuretic renogram should be performed to detect obstruction.</p><p/><p>A more complete description of the radiological studies discussed before is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of other anomalies, the prognosis for a patient with an ectopic kidney is excellent. This was illustrated in a retrospective study from a single Dutch center of 41 patients; 26 had simple ectopy (ie, unilateral pelvic kidney) and 15 had crossed renal ectopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The median age at diagnosis was 0.2 years. In three patients, a defined syndrome was diagnosed (ie, Treacher Collins, Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser, and Goldenhar syndromes). At follow-up (median age of 7.7 years), blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria were stable without evidence of deterioration. There was no difference in outcome between patients with simple ectopy versus those with crossed ectopia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL FUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal fusion occurs when a portion of one kidney is fused to the other. The most common fusion anomaly is the horseshoe kidney, which involves abnormal migration of both kidneys (ectopy), resulting in fusion. This differs from crossed fused renal ectopy, which usually involves abnormal movement of only one kidney across the midline with fusion of the contralateral noncrossing kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Horseshoe kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common fusion anomaly is the horseshoe kidney, which occurs with fusion of one pole of each kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75867\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75867 \">figure 3</a>). The reported incidence based upon data from birth defect registries varies from 0.4 to 1.6 in 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A higher incidence (1 in 600 births) was reported from a single center that reviewed the results of abdominal computerized tomography, renal ultrasonography, and excretory urography of all infants younger than six months of age over a six-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, this higher incidence is most likely an overestimation, as this was a highly selected group of patients who underwent radiologic evaluation, who could have a higher incidence of horseshoe kidney compared with the general population.</p><p>In more than 90 percent of cases, fusion occurs at the lower poles; as a result two separate excretory renal units and ureters are maintained. The isthmus (fused portion) may lie over the midline (symmetric horseshoe kidney) or lateral to the midline (asymmetric horseshoe kidney). Depending on the degree of fusion, the isthmus can be composed of renal parenchyma or a fibrous band (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75867\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75867 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Fusion is thought to occur before the kidneys ascend from the pelvis to their normal dorsolumbar position. This is usually between the fifth and ninth weeks of gestation. The majority of horseshoe kidneys with a parenchymal isthmus result from an abnormal migration of the posterior nephrogenic area, which generally occurs before the fifth week of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Horseshoe kidneys with a fibrous isthmus arise from fusion after the fifth week of gestation, before renal ascent. If large portions of the renal parenchyma fuse, the fusion anomaly loses its horseshoe appearance and appears as a flattened disc or lump kidney.</p><p>Early fusion also causes abnormal rotation of the developing kidneys. As a result, the axis of each kidney is shifted so that the renal pelvis lies anteriorly and the ureters either traverse over the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney or the anterior surface of the fused kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75867\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75867 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Fusion anomalies seldom ascend to the dorsolumbar position of normal kidneys and are typically found in the pelvis or at the lower lumbar vertebral level (L4 or L5). The blood supply of the fused kidney is variable and may come from the iliac arteries, aorta, and at times, the hypogastric and middle sacral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with horseshoe kidneys are asymptomatic. In these patients, the horseshoe kidney is diagnosed by coincidence (eg, routine antenatal ultrasonography). However, some patients present with pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria due to obstruction or infection.</p><p>Hydronephrosis is reported to occur in approximately 80 percent of children with horseshoe kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Causes of hydronephrosis include vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), or obstruction of the collecting system by ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), renal calculi, or external ureteric compression by an aberrant vessel. UPJO is associated with the high insertion of the ureters into the renal pelvis and displacement of the fused isthmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Renal calculi are reported to occur in 20 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73581\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73581 \">image 1</a>). Obstruction resulting in urinary stasis and increased risk of infection have been thought to be the major contributing factors for stone formation. However, a retrospective review reported a high rate of metabolic abnormalities (including hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, and hypocitraturia) in patients with horseshoe kidney and renal calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In contrast, others have found no difference in the frequency of metabolic abnormalities associated with renal calculi between patients with a horseshoe kidney and the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Patients with a horseshoe kidney are at increased risk for infection because of the increased likelihood of urinary stasis. Impaired urinary drainage resulting in stasis is thought to be due to the high insertion of the renal ureter (which leads to UPJO).</p><p>One-third to one-half of patients with horseshoe kidneys will have another congenital anomaly, particularly another urological abnormality (eg, VUR) or a genital anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urological anomalies &minus; VUR and UPJO are common findings in patients with horseshoe kidneys. As an example, in a case series of 52 patients, VUR and UPJO were noted in 13 and 12 patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other urological abnormalities reported in children with horseshoe kidneys include ureteral duplication, ectopic ureter, ureterocele, and a retrocaval ureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The estimated incidence from autopsy data is approximately 1 in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In most cases, the ectopic kidney is positioned inferiorly to the contralateral kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60213\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60213 \">figure 2</a>). The contralateral kidney can either retain its normal dorsolumbar position or is positioned lower in the pelvis or lower lumbar vertebral level (L4 or L5).</p><p>Most patients with crossed fused ectopy are asymptomatic and are detected coincidentally, often by antenatal ultrasonography. Associated reported anomalies include sacral agenesis, scoliosis, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>As is true in patients with horseshoe kidney, most patients have an excellent prognosis without need for intervention. In some cases, complications can occur, including renal calculi, urinary infection, VUR, and obstructive uropathy due to UPJO or external compression by an aberrant vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Renal ultrasonography can detect the crossed fused ectopic kidney. In symptomatic cases, magnetic resonance urogram is often required to characterize the complete anatomy of the fused kidneys and corresponding ureters. The evaluation and treatment of patients with crossed fused ectopy is similar to that of patients with horseshoe kidneys. If surgery is required, computed tomographic angiography might be needed to characterize vascular anatomy, as the vascular supply can be anomalous to both the ectopic and nonectopic kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal ectopic and fusion anomalies are due to disruption of the normal embryogenic process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68500\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68500 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Normal embryogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal ectopy is a positional abnormality with failure of the kidney(s) to normally ascend to the retroperitoneal renal fossa (level of the second lumbar vertebrae). Simple renal ectopy refers to a kidney that lies on the correct side but in an abnormal position, and crossed renal ectopy to a kidney that crosses the midline to the contralateral side. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Renal ectopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal fusion occurs when a portion of one kidney is fused to the other. The most common fusion anomaly is the horseshoe kidney, which involves abnormal migration of both kidneys (ectopy) resulting in fusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75867\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75867 \">figure 3</a>). Crossed fused renal ectopia, another renal fusion anomaly, usually involves abnormal movement of only one kidney across the midline with fusion of the contralateral noncrossing kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60213\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60213 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with an ectopic or fused kidney(s) are asymptomatic and are diagnosed coincidentally, often by antenatal ultrasonography. In patients diagnosed symptomatically with either anomaly, symptoms at presentation are generally related to associated complications including urinary tract infection, obstruction, and renal calculi. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings of renal ectopy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with renal ectopy or fused kidneys are at increased risk for other anomalies, especially genitourinary abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings of renal ectopy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation for either renal ectopy or fusion includes the following three studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ultrasonography to demonstrate ectopy or fusion, determine the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of hydronephrosis, and, in patients with renal ectopy, assess the renal anatomy of the contralateral kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with urinary tract infections, voiding cystourethrogram to determine <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of VUR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is evidence of progressive obstruction or bilateral renal disease, serum creatinine to measure renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Further evaluation is dependent upon the results of these three initial tests.
