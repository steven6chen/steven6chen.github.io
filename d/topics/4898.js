The central premise of the MCTD concept is that of an overlap syndrome associated with anti-U1 RNP antibodies that incorporates selected clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (scleroderma [SSc]), and polymyositis (PM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The definitive diagnosis of MCTD is often complicated by the fact that the overlapping features tend to occur sequentially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This confusion arises due to the overlap of the various diffuse connective tissue diseases (DCTD), as well as to changes in the underlying pathology of the illnesses.</p><p>The definition and diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease are reviewed here.

A sixth disorder, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, is commonly associated with each of these diseases but is called primary Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome when it occurs alone.</p><p>The classical clinical descriptions of these disorders are well known, and most patients with well-differentiated disease are easily recognized. However, the definitive diagnosis of each of these disorders is based upon criteria derived from expert opinion; as such, the diagnostic criteria are updated from time to time, depending upon the relevance of contemporary research. Clinicians experienced in the clinical presentations of the connective tissue disorder often note that one autoimmune rheumatic disease seems to evolve into another over the course of several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This occurs in about 25 percent of patients, who are then said to have an overlap syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undifferentiated-systemic-rheumatic-connective-tissue-diseases-and-overlap-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases and overlap syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is often complicated by the fact that the characteristic overlapping features of SLE, systemic sclerosis (SSc), and inflammatory myopathy, found in association with high titers of anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibody, tend to occur sequentially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Confusion arises due to the overlap of the various diffuse connective tissue diseases (DCTD), as well as to changes in the underlying pathology of the illnesses.</p><p>Several years may elapse before the constellation of findings suggests the presence of MCTD. As noted above, many patients with a DCTD present with nondiagnostic features, which are considered to represent an &quot;undifferentiated&quot; connective tissue disease (UCTD), before displaying clinical characteristics most consistent with a known disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, the initial diagnostic considerations will be expansive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76047 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>A key feature in suspecting a diagnosis of MCTD is the presence of unexplained Raynaud phenomenon. If systemic sclerosis can be ruled out and the patient has a speckled-pattern antinuclear antibody (ANA), usually in high titer, further immunological testing is warranted. The finding of anti-RNP antibodies provides further important, but not conclusive, evidence for a diagnosis of MCTD. Confirmation of a diagnosis of MCTD requires the development of typical clinical features. In the early stages, these will be joint pain (often without obvious synovitis), puffy fingers, and low-grade myositis (nearly always accompanied by an elevated CPK). The development of &quot;classical&quot; MCTD often requires several years of careful clinical evaluation to confirm the presence of typical overlap features and to rule out the development of another autoimmune rheumatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several attempts have been made to standardize the diagnostic criteria for MCTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. One study reviewed four sets of diagnostic criteria (Sharp, Alarcon-Segovia, Kasukawa, and Kahn) and concluded that those of Alarcon-Segovia and Kahn were &quot;best&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The criteria utilized by Alarcon-Segovia had a sensitivity and specificity of 63 and 86 percent, respectively; this accuracy is comparable to that found with the criteria utilized by Kahn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74610 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Is MCTD a specific disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>None of the DCTDs can be defined as a specific disease, if a distinct disease, by definition, requires both unique clinical features and consistent pathology. Each DCTD contains subsets of patients with clinical and pathologic characteristics which differ from other patients with the same diagnosis. After the original description of MCTD in 1972, there initially was controversy as to its place as a &quot;distinctive&quot; DCTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>], but some 40 years and over 1700 MCTD publications later, there is a consensus that MCTD should be considered a &quot;distinct clinical entity&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In the early stages, most patients destined to develop MCTD cannot be differentiated from the other classical DCTDs. The early simultaneous presence of overlap features usually seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (scleroderma [SSc]), and polymyositis (PM) is seldom seen. More commonly, the overlapping features occur sequentially over several years. Prominent early symptoms are easy fatigability, poorly defined myalgias, arthralgias, and the Raynaud phenomenon. The common diagnostic considerations at this juncture are usually rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE, or UCTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/3,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15-17</a>]. If the patient has swollen hands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> puffy fingers in association with a high titer speckled antinuclear antibody (ANA), they should be carefully followed for the evolution of overlap features. A high titer of anti-RNP antibodies in such a patient is a powerful predictor of a later evolution to MCTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Other, less common, early features include severe inflammatory myopathy, acute arthritis, aseptic meningitis, transverse myelitis, digital gangrene, high fever, acute abdomen and trigeminal neuropathy, and sensorineural hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>].</p><p>The major reason for considering MCTD a distinct clinical entity is that the presence of high titers of anti-U1 RNP antibodies is associated with several distinctive clinical characteristics. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with U1 RNP antibodies seldom develop diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, psychosis, or seizures; these abnormalities are a major source of morbidity and mortality in SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with U1 RNP antibodies nearly always have an early development of the Raynaud phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/1,2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,28</a>] and a nailfold capillary pattern that is the same as in SSc but that is different from classical SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The Raynaud phenomenon only occurs in about 25 percent of patients with classical SLE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with U1 RNP antibodies are more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension than patients with classical SLE or SSc. Pulmonary hypertension is the major cause of death in MCTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with U1 RNP antibodies are more likely than SLE patients to test positively for rheumatoid factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>] or antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and they are also more likely to develop an erosive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/32-34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a preponderance of immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) antibodies are more likely to have SLE. One study has reported that a combined IgM reactivity for fragments of U1C and U1A of U1 RNP is capable of classifying SLE and MCTD patients with an accuracy of 71.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, the concept of MCTD is useful in defining a subgroup of patients with unique clinical features, treatment profile, and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presenting symptoms in MCTD are often nonspecific, such as frequent fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, and low-grade fevers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/1,2,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,36</a>]. Some patients, however, present acutely with trigeminal neuropathy, severe polymyositis, acute arthritis, aseptic meningitis, digital gangrene, acute abdomen, or high fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>].</p><p>Characteristic clinical symptoms of MCTD eventually emerge, including the Raynaud phenomenon, hand edema, puffy fingers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prominent synovitis. Overlapping clinical features include inflammatory muscle disease and sclerodactyly. Affected patients are prone to develop pulmonary hypertension and a scleroderma-like vasculopathy, but serious renal or central nervous system (CNS) disease is uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of mixed connective tissue disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the original description of MCTD included circulating autoantibodies directed against ENA (a ribonuclease [RNAse]-sensitive extractable nuclear antigen), which has since been determined to be U1 RNP. The presence of this specific antibody remains a sine qua non for the diagnosis of MCTD.</p><p>Nevertheless, anti-U1 RNP antibodies alone do not guarantee that a patient either has MCTD or will continue to display the MCTD phenotype. As an example, the first clue to the diagnosis of MCTD is often the presence of a positive ANA with a high titer speckled pattern (commonly &gt;1:1000 and often &gt;1:10,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, antibodies to U1 RNP, Sm, Ro, and La all produce a speckled pattern, and antibodies to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA), Sm, and Ro are occasionally seen transiently in patients with MCTD. If dsDNA, Sm, or Ro are the dominant and persistent autoantibody system, then the patient is more likely to develop a connective tissue illness other than MCTD. If, on the other hand, antibodies to U1 RNP remain dominant, then the patient is likely to continue to have the clinical characteristics of MCTD.</p><p>There are several hierarchies of antibody response in patients who eventually develop MCTD, with each higher level being associated with an increased expression of the MCTD clinical profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 1 &ndash; Positive ANA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 2 &ndash; High titer, speckled ANA pattern</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 3 &ndash; Anti-U1 RNP antibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 4 &ndash; Anti-68 kD and A' antibodies</p><p/><p>U1 RNP consists of ribonucleic acid (RNA) plus three proteins (A', C, and a 68-70 kD protein). The clinical picture of MCTD most closely correlates with the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the 68 to 70 kD and A' proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>].

It is further defined by the uniform presence of high titers of a distinctive autoantibody, now called anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and previously termed antibody to extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA).
