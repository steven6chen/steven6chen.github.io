Laboratory tests for hCG are almost 100 percent sensitive and specific for diagnosis of the trophoblast-related conditions, ie, pregnancy and the gestational trophoblastic diseases. Rarely, very low levels of hCG are detected in the absence of one of these conditions. Understanding the complexity of hCG molecules and the nuances of hCG testing is critical to managing these patients.

The alpha and beta-subunits are coded by separate genes on chromosomes 6 and 19, respectively, and noncovalently bind before being released into the circulation. </p><p>Sugar side chains comprise 25 to 40 percent of the molecular weight of hCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The alpha-subunit contains two N-linked oligosaccharides attached at amino acid residues 53 and 78; the beta-subunit contains two N-linked oligosaccharides attached at amino acid residues 13 and 30, as well as four O-linked oligosaccharides attached at amino acid residues 121, 127, 132, and 138 on the C-terminal extension. </p><p>Several isoforms of hCG exist in the circulation; some are synthesized by cells and others are degradation products. </p><p>The two most common forms of hCG synthesized by cells are regular hCG and hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H). hCG-H contains more sugar residues than regular hCG: 1.5-fold more sugar residues on the N-linked oligosaccharides (16 versus 11 sugar residues for regular hCG) and twofold more sugar residues on O-linked oligosaccharides (six versus three sugar residues for regular hCG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The additional sugar residues increase the molecular weight from 36,700 to as high as 41,000 and are the basis of the term &quot;hyperglycosylated&quot; hCG.</p><p>Serum hCG molecules that are degradation products are not synthesized directly, with the exception of hCG-H free beta subunit.

When hCG is present, it is immobilized by the capture antibody and labeled by the tracer antibody using an enzyme (lanthanide) or a radioactive label. A sandwich consisting of immobilized antibody-hCG-tracer antibody is formed. After washing away excess material, the amount of now-immobilized label is measured and is directly proportional to the amount of hCG joining the sandwiches together. This is called an immunometric assay and is the mechanism of all commercial hCG assays.</p><p>The total hCG is the combined concentration of all hCG variants in a particular assay, but not all assays detect all variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The only commercial assay that detects all hCG variants is the Siemen's Immulite Series. At a minimum, the assay used by a clinical lab to measure serum hCG should detect both regular and hyperglycosylated hCG. The relative proportion of hCG variants detected varies among commercial assays. It is important to note many over-the-counter urine pregnancy tests do not measure hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H), which accounts for most of the total hCG at the time of missed menses when these tests are typically performed. </p><p>For clinicians, it is also important to know the sensitivity of the test at the lab used. Urine pregnancy tests may only detect total hCG levels &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span>. For serum tests, the threshold for a negative result varies (ie, &lt;1 versus &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL)</span>. </p><p>The effects on clinical practice of the variability across tests in terms of variants measured and sensitivity are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial hCG measurements should be performed in the same lab whenever possible. If performed in different labs, the result may not represent a true change in the hCG concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to use a sensitive hCG test that detects both regular and hCG-H when following hCG levels to negative in women with gestational trophoblastic disease. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17620393\"><span class=\"h2\">False negative test (hook effect)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At serum levels of hCG above 500,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL,</span> a &quot;hook effect&quot; can occur, resulting in an artifactually low value for hCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This is because the sensitivity of most hCG tests is set to the pregnancy hCG range (ie, 27,300 to 233,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> at 8 to 11 weeks of gestation). Therefore, when an extremely high hCG concentration is present, both the capture and tracer antibodies used in immunoradiometric assays become saturated, preventing the binding of the two to create a sandwich [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Since the non-sandwiched tracer antibodies are washed away with the excess material, the test result will be negative. For this reason, a suspected diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease must be communicated to the laboratory so that the hCG assay will also be performed at 1:1000 dilution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17620435\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing for pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical use of this test for diagnosis of pregnancy (intrauterine or ectopic) is reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23793914\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCE AND FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational and nongestational trophoblasts are by far the most common sources of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), but a small amount of the hormone may also be produced by the pituitary gland and non-trophoblastic malignancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23793920\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The progenitor villous cytotrophoblast cell is the stem cell of the placenta.

Its functions include transport of gases, nutrients, and waste products and synthesis of peptide and steroid hormones that regulate placental, fetal, and maternal systems. The syncytiotrophoblast produces regular hCG, which maintains the corpus luteum on the ovary. The corpus luteum produces progesterone until placental progesterone production becomes established (after six weeks of gestation). Regular hCG also appears to play a role in myometrial spiral artery angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].

It is associated with low levels of hCG relative to tumor size because there is a lack of syncytiotrophoblastic proliferation. The free beta-subunit of hCG is the main form of hCG in PSTT. This occurs because the tumor cells, unlike normal trophoblast cells, lack the ability to efficiently combine beta- and alpha-subunits.

It typically occurs after a complete hydatidiform mole, but has been reported after choriocarcinoma, invasive moles, and partial moles.
