It mostly affects your central vision, so that things in the center look blurry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57989\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57989 \">picture 1</a>). It is most common among people age 65 and older.</p><p>There are 2 types of AMD, wet and dry:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dry AMD</strong> is the most common type. It affects 85 to 90 percent of people with the condition. It causes gradual vision loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wet AMD</strong> is less common. It affects 10 to 15 percent of people with the condition. But it moves more quickly and can cause severe vision loss or even blindness.</p><p/><p>Some people can start out with dry macular degeneration and then develop the wet type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11039579\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of AMD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are different depending on what type of AMD you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with <strong>dry AMD</strong> lose their vision slowly. They might notice a problem with one or both eyes when reading or driving. Or they might realize that they now need bright lights or a magnifying glass to see as well as they used to. People with dry AMD sometimes also notice spots that seem blurry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with <strong>wet AMD</strong> can have sudden changes in vision. When they first notice symptoms, they might have problems in only one eye. (Later, both eyes usually develop problems.) When people with wet AMD look at straight lines, the lines actually look bent or wavy. For this reason, doctors often test people's vision by asking them to look at a grid of straight lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74919\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74919 \">figure 1</a>). People who say the lines look bent could have wet AMD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11039586\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you notice vision loss or any of the other symptoms listed above, see an eye doctor as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11039593\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for AMD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for AMD, doctors can use a few different tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dilated eye exam</strong> &ndash; For this test, the doctor gives you eye drops to make your pupils open up. Then, he or she uses a special tool to look at the back of your eye, called the retina. That's the part of the eye that gets damaged by AMD. The doctor also looks for clumps called drusen, which form in the eyes of people who have AMD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Fluorescein</a><strong> angiography</strong> &ndash; This test helps doctors see the blood vessels in the retina. The test is useful because people with wet AMD sometimes develop abnormal blood vessels in the retina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Optical coherence tomography (OCT)</strong> &ndash; This test creates detailed pictures of the retina. It can show if the retina is damaged.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11039600\"><span class=\"h1\">How is macular degeneration treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both wet and dry AMD can be treated with a special combination of vitamins and minerals, called the &quot;AREDS formula.&quot; This formula seems to protect the eye from the damage caused by AMD. It is sold without a prescription. But ask your doctor or nurse before you start taking it. Certain vitamins can be harmful if you take them in the wrong amounts. Plus, people who smoke can have serious problems if they take some vitamins.</p><p>There are no treatments for dry AMD besides the AREDS formula. But there are other treatments for wet AMD.</p><p>Treatments for wet AMD work by destroying abnormal blood vessels in the retina, or by preventing new blood vessels from forming there. That's important, because much of the damage of wet AMD is caused by abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines called VEGF inhibitors</strong> &ndash; These medicines come in shots that go right into the eye. They help keep new blood vessels from forming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Photodynamic therapy</strong> &ndash; For this treatment, you get a shot of a medicine that &quot;sticks to&quot; abnormal blood vessels. This medicine becomes toxic when it is exposed to light. After you get the shot, a doctor or nurse shines a special light into your eye. When the light hits the medicine in the blood vessels in the back the eye, the medicine destroys the blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laser surgery</strong> &ndash; For this treatment, doctors shine lasers into the eye and use them to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11039607\"><span class=\"h1\">Can AMD be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting AMD by not smoking, or by quitting if you already smoke. If you already have AMD and you smoke, quitting can actually help slow the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11039704\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-vision-loss-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related vision loss (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetic retinopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataracts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cataracts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Open-angle glaucoma (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
