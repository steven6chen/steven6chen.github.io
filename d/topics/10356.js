Treatment usually involves dilation combined with acid-suppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 25 percent of cases of benign esophageal strictures are unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux, and treatment in these cases may be more difficult. Examples include strictures secondary to external beam radiation, esophageal sclerotherapy, caustic ingestions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caustic esophageal injury in adults&quot;</a>), surgical anastomosis, and rare dermatologic diseases (eg, epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica). Strictures may also result from external compression of the esophagus due to mediastinal fibrosis induced by tuberculosis or idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis. These conditions result in long and narrow strictures that are difficult to dilate, and in which dilation may be associated with a higher rate of complications. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a more commonly recognized cause of esophageal strictures, particularly in young men. Its recognition is important since dilation can be associated with mucosal tearing and perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goals of therapy for benign esophageal strictures are the relief of dysphagia and the prevention of stricture recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the majority of patients, this can be accomplished with esophageal dilation, though in cases of refractory strictures, additional therapy may be required.</p><p>This topic will review the management of benign esophageal strictures, including patient selection, methods of dilation, and treatment of refractory esophageal strictures. Complications of dilation, pneumatic dilation of the lower esophageal sphincter for achalasia, dilation of esophageal rings and webs, and management of malignant esophageal obstruction are discussed separately.

However, dysphagia may be caused by conditions other than an esophageal stricture, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, motility disturbances, infection, malignancy, and esophageal webs or rings. Although treatment of some of these conditions may involve esophageal dilation, the specific techniques used differ. Therefore, endoscopic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic evaluation of the stricture is required prior to determining a course of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the evaluation of dysphagia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Barium studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow is not needed prior to endoscopy in most patients with a suspected esophageal stricture. However, it is typically performed in patients in whom there is concern that a complex esophageal stricture may be present (such as from radiation therapy or after caustic ingestion). The goals are to establish the location, length, and number of strictures, determine the diameter of the esophageal lumen, and look for associated pathology such as esophageal diverticula or a hiatal hernia. This information is used to select the dilating technique, to determine the number of sessions that will be required to relieve symptoms, and to counsel the patient about the expected risks of dilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> studies raise suspicion for a malignant cause, a diagnostic endoscopy may be required prior to dilation. However, endoscopy and dilation are more often performed together during the initial session.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS TO DILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific features of the esophageal stricture as well as comorbid illnesses can increase the risk of esophageal dilation. Dilation should be avoided or performed with caution in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilation should not be attempted in the setting of an acute or incompletely healed esophageal perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the case of a potentially malignant stricture, dilation should be postponed until the stricture has been confirmed to be benign.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of esophageal dilation should be weighed against the risk of the procedure in patients with bleeding disorders or severe pulmonary or cardiovascular disease as such patients may not tolerate endoscopy with or without dilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilation should be performed cautiously in patients with a pharyngeal or cervical deformity, recent surgery, a large thoracic aneurysm, or an impacted food bolus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilation should be carried out with extreme care in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, due to an increased risk of esophageal perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ESOPHAGEAL DILATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal dilators fall into two main categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical (push-type or Bougie) dilators</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balloon dilators</p><p/><p>Studies comparing mechanical (Bougie) dilation with balloon dilation have shown variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The success of one technique versus another depends largely upon the endoscopist's experience and familiarity with a particular system. </p><p>The exact mechanism leading to an increase in esophageal lumen size during dilation is unknown. It is probably due to either circumferential stretching or splitting of the stricture. Mechanical and balloon dilators differ in how they accomplish this goal. Mechanical dilators exert a longitudinal and radial force and dilate progressively from the proximal to the distal extent of the stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, balloon dilators simultaneously deliver the entire dilating force radially over the entire length of the stricture, significantly reducing shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical dilators can be divided into those which are passed freely and those that are inserted over a guidewire.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Maloney dilator is the most commonly used dilator that does not require passage over a guidewire. Maloney dilators have a tapered tip and come in multiple sizes. Another freely passed dilator (Hurst) has a rounded tip that may be more difficult to pass and is rarely used. Both Maloney and Hurst dilators were traditionally filled with mercury, which provided flexibility and weight. Because of concerns over leakage and disposal of mercury, both are also available with tungsten filling, which simulates the weight and feel of mercury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several versions of guidewire assisted dilators are available, but the Savary-Gilliard is probably the most commonly used. This dilator is made from plastic, has a tapered tip, and comes in multiple sizes. Another similar system is the American Dilatation System. An older system, the Eder-Puestow olive dilators, uses progressively larger elliptical metal dilators passed over a guidewire. Because Savary dilators are flexible and easy to use, they have generally supplanted the use of the metal olive dilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A flexible, transparent bougie has been developed that fits over a standard endoscope and has three dilating steps, thereby allowing for sequential dilation under direct visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Experience with this dilator is limited.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two types of balloon dilators: through-the-scope (TTS) dilators (multiple manufacturers), which are passed directly through the biopsy channel of the endoscope, and an over-the-guidewire (OTW) balloon dilator (multiple manufacturers). Compared with their predecessors, newer balloons are capable of exerting a greater radial force and more predictably retain their maximum diameter. Balloon dilators were available initially in sizes that increased by 2 mm increments, which made them unfavorable compared with the gradual dilation provided by the Maloney and Savary systems. Improvements in the TTS balloons allow them to expand to three different diameters at 1.0 to 1.5 mm increments (depending upon the TTS balloon being used) without having to change balloons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66533 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to a patient with an esophageal stricture depends upon characteristics of the stricture and the endoscopist's familiarity with the available systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple esophageal strictures are typically related to prolonged reflux esophagitis (peptic strictures). They are smooth surfaced, short, straight, located in the distal esophagus, and can be traversed with the endoscope (ie, &gt;10 mm in diameter). In such cases, passage of Maloney dilators can lead to effective and safe dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, many endoscopists will treat the stricture with either a balloon dilator or a mechanical dilator passed over a guidewire based upon personal preferences. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Complex strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complex esophageal strictures have one or more characteristics that require special attention during dilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of specific dilation systems. Examples include strictures that are long, narrow, or tortuous, or strictures associated with large hiatal hernias, esophageal diverticula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57582\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57582 \">image 1</a>), or a tracheoesophageal fistula. In such cases, the tips of freely passed dilators may not enter the stomach and can perforate the esophagus. To avoid this complication, complex strictures require the use of a guidewire-based system or a balloon dilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In some cases, the patient may be managed using a combination of dilators. As an example, a patient with a narrow distal esophageal stricture that cannot be traversed with the endoscope may undergo initial dilation using a guidewire or balloon dilator. Once the lumen is sufficiently patent (and if there are no other complex features), Maloney dilators may be used for further dilating sessions.</p><p>Patients with proximal esophageal strictures may benefit from a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow prior to dilation to define the location and extent of the stricture. Strictures in the upper esophagus are typically treated using a dilator that is passed over a guidewire (eg, a Savary dilator), sometimes under fluoroscopic guidance. Through-the-scope balloon dilators generally cannot be used in patients with proximal strictures because to do so requires that the endoscope be maintained in the oropharynx during the dilation.</p><p>Dilatation in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) should be used primarily as an adjunctive therapy when medical treatment fails. When it is required, it should be performed carefully since dilation of EoE has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal tearing and perforation. Dilatation has been performed with both mechanical (Savary and Maloney) dilators and balloons; neither has been shown to be superior. The maximum diameter to be achieved should be the one that produces symptomatic relief, usually 13 to 14 mm. Mucosal tearing occurs frequently, often down to the muscularis, as can be seen if endoscopy is performed after the dilatation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review looked at 18 papers that evaluated the risk of perforation in eosinophilic esophagitis. In a total of 671 dilations in 468 patients, the relative perforation risk overall was 0.1 percent, which is similar to the rate seen with strictured dilations for indications other than EoE. They suggest that this risk may have been overrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal dilation is typically performed as an ambulatory procedure using conscious sedation and topical pharyngeal anesthesia. Patients requiring multiple dilations may tolerate the procedure well without sedation. Motivated patients requiring frequent dilations may even use Maloney dilators to perform self-dilation at home.</p><p>Prior to dilation, patients are kept fasting to assure a clear view of the esophageal lumen and avoid aspiration. Most patients are instructed to avoid antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants for five to seven days prior to the procedure. While recommended in the past, the American Heart Association and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy no longer recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for esophageal dilations, even in patients at high risk for bacterial endocarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51133 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotic prophylaxis for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiplatelet-agents-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anticoagulants in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Proper positioning of the patient and assistance from an endoscopy nurse help assure the safe passage of the dilators. Dilation is usually performed in the left lateral decubitus position, although Maloney dilators can be safely passed with the patient seated.</p><p>The choice of the initial dilator size is based upon the stricture diameter, which can be estimated during radiography or by comparing the stricture to the outer diameter of the endoscope. When using mechanical dilators, the diameter of the initial dilator should be approximately the same width as the stricture. Similarly, for balloon dilators, the initial balloon size corresponds to the estimated stricture diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7991840\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of dilation with a Maloney dilator, once the dilator has been chosen based upon the size of the stricture, the endoscope is removed, and the dilator is passed blindly. The endoscopist should assess for resistance to passage of the dilator and look for blood on the dilator. If these signs are not present, it suggests that the size of the chosen dilator was too small, and a larger dilator should be used. Typically, multiple dilators are passed during one session. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Number of dilations per session'</a> below.)</p><p>If the dilator is being passed over a guidewire, the guidewire is fed through the accessory channel of the endoscope into to the stomach. Once the guidewire is in place, the scope is withdrawn, taking care to maintain the position of the guidewire. The dilator is then passed over the guidewire and the stricture is dilated. As with dilation using a Maloney dilator, the endoscopist feels and looks for signs that the stricture is being successfully dilated.</p><p>Dilation can be performed without endoscopy, during endoscopy with or without fluoroscopy, or under fluoroscopy alone, depending upon the clinical circumstances and preference of the endoscopist. As an example, some endoscopists routinely use fluoroscopy when passing a guidewire through a narrow stricture. Others will pass a guidewire through the stricture during endoscopy without fluoroscopy if the passage into the stomach is clearly visible or if the patient has undergone prior endoscopy (assuring that there is no unexpected pathology or anatomical variant distal to the view of the endoscope) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Whether or not fluoroscopy improves the effectiveness of dilation is uncertain. One study randomly assigned 83 patients with benign esophageal strictures to Maloney dilation with or without fluoroscopic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients who underwent dilation with fluoroscopy more often tolerated passage of a 12.5 mm <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> pill after dilation (62 versus 42 percent) and more often had significant improvements in dysphagia scores (93 versus 69 percent). In another study, however, the experience of the endoscopist rather than the use of fluoroscopy correlated with the success of dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7991997\"><span class=\"h2\">Through-the-scope balloon dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many endoscopists have not received as much training in the use of balloon dilating systems compared with mechanical dilators. This may in part reflect the ease and relative safety of mechanical dilating systems compared with early balloon systems. However, prospective comparisons of through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilators with mechanical dilators suggest that they are equally safe for dilating esophageal strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, one study suggested that stricture recurrence may be less during the second year following TTS compared with mechanical dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>TTS balloon dilators are passed through the channel of the endoscope into the stricture under direct visualization or during fluoroscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66533 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71653\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71653 \">picture 2</a>). To prevent proximal migration of the balloon during inflation, the endoscope should be positioned just above the proximal end of the balloon, while holding the balloon sheath tightly. Successful dilation can usually be inferred by the ability to move the inflated balloon freely through the treated stricture.</p><p>Fluoroscopic observation during balloon inflation assures that the maximum diameter has been achieved. To be visible, the balloon needs to be filled with a 1:3 dilution of water soluble contrast. Adequate dilation is seen as obliteration of the balloon &quot;waist,&quot; which corresponds with stricture stretching or splitting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The optimal number and duration of inflations have not been established. Most endoscopists perform two to three dilations in a session, maintaining balloon inflation for 30 to 60 seconds per dilation. It is the author's practice to perform two dilations per session, maintaining balloon inflation for 30 seconds per dilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Number of dilations per session</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A generally accepted rule is that, when a bougie dilator is being used, no more than three dilators of progressively increasing diameter should be passed in a single session and that the luminal stenosis should be increased by no more than 6 French (2 mm) over the initial dilation (eg, if the initial dilation is performed with a 21 Fr dilator, the maximum dilator size used should be no more than 27 Fr) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Similarly, for balloon dilators, most endoscopists will limit the dilation to no more than three incremental inflations (eg, sequential inflations of 10, 11 and 12 mm). For very tight or for long strictures, only one or two dilations should be performed per session. These rules help to reduce the likelihood of adverse sequelae related to overly exuberant dilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of endoscopic esophageal stricture dilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, experienced endoscopists may perform more aggressive dilation in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/19,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24,25</a>]. The effectiveness of dilation is approximated by the degree of resistance during passage of the dilator. Experience assists in determining the maximal resistance that can be safely tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeated sessions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of repeated dilation sessions depends upon the success of initial dilation and the patient's past response to dilation. Patients undergoing esophageal dilation for the first time may require multiple sessions, especially if the stricture has a narrow diameter and exhibits significant resistance during dilation. Such patients may require repeated sessions every five to seven days. After sufficient progress has been achieved, less frequent dilating sessions may be satisfactory. In some patients, however, symptoms tend to recur rapidly following dilation. Such patients require more frequent dilations based upon symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Endpoint of dilation'</a> below.)</p><p>As a general rule, the last dilator used in the previous session can be passed first. However, shrinkage of strictures following dilation should be expected, and not all patients will tolerate passage of the largest diameter dilator used during the previous session. Since the amount of shrinkage is hard to predict, it is helpful to reassess the stricture diameter prior to dilation. If there has been significant shrinkage a smaller sized dilator may be required. The experience during previous dilating sessions with an individual patient may also influence the choice of dilator size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety of mucosal biopsy prior to dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucosal biopsy of the esophagus prior to dilation carries the theoretical risk of causing a lead point for excessive mucosal tearing during dilation. This concern has led to the general recommendation that biopsies be performed after dilation. However, this is not always practical, since it requires reinsertion of the endoscope if a mechanical dilation method has been used.</p><p>Although few data have directly addressed this issue, it is frequent practice and is probably safe to perform dilation immediately after endoscopic mucosal biopsy. In support of this practice is a small series of 48 patients who underwent esophageal dilation following mucosal biopsy; no complications related to the mucosal biopsy were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDPOINT OF DILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus as to how much dilatation is sufficient. As a general rule, the size of the lumen following dilation corresponds to symptom relief and the need for recurrent dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Dilation to 18 mm (54 French) allows intake of a regular diet unless there is a coexisting motility disturbance. Endoscopic dilation over 16 mm is associated with a significant prolongation of the dilation-free period in comparison with dilation up to 16 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. By comparison, patients with an esophageal lumen less than 13 mm (39 French) will usually experience solid food dysphagia. Some endoscopists advocate use of an objective measure (such as passage of a 12 mm <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> tablet) as the endpoint for dilation (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Some strictures are more difficult to dilate and narrower luminal diameters may need to be accepted. Patients dilated to a diameter of 15 mm (45 French) are generally able to eat a modified regular diet.

In older studies of patients with esophageal strictures, approximately 70 percent of patients required repeated dilations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/1,4,5,13,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,13,28</a>].

However, many studies of the natural history of esophageal strictures were performed prior to the introduction of proton pump inhibitors.</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors in patients with peptic strictures reduce the need for subsequent dilation and are more effective than H2 antagonists for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>]. In one study, for example, 336 patients with peptic esophageal strictures were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> (20 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> (150 mg twice daily) for one year after esophageal dilation to 12 to 18 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Subsequent endoscopy and dilation were performed when clinically indicated. The omeprazole-treated patients required significantly fewer repeated dilation sessions (30 percent versus 46 percent) and had improved dysphagia scores compared with the ranitidine-treated group. The greater effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors is in part explained by the observation that dysphagia in patients with peptic strictures is related to the stricture diameter and the presence of esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Our practice is to treat most patients with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for one year following dilation, though some patients (such as those with significant reflux) may require up to 40 mg twice daily. </p><p>However, use of a proton pump inhibitor does not obviate the need for achieving adequate dilation for peptic strictures. It has been suggested that objective evidence of stricture size following dilation is important, even when patients are treated with a proton pump inhibitor. In one study, objective evidence of successful dilation was defined as passage of a 12 mm <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> pill following dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The technical success in stent placement and removal were 95 and 94 percent, respectively. Median dysphagia scores improved, but at a median follow-up of one year, only 40 percent were dysphagia-free.

Nearly all of the stent migration events occurred within 30 days of insertion (10 of 11 migration events). This lower rate of migration may be due to the presence of flared flanges in all three types of FCSEMSs used in this series and not present on the Alimaxx-ES stent. The stents were successfully removed endoscopically in 29 of 31 patients. One stent was removed during the surgical correction of a fistula.
