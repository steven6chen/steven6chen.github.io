In addition, hyperinsulinemia may also explain the obesity-breast cancer relationship because a high BMI is associated with higher insulin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In the 2000 pooled analysis discussed above, premenopausal women with a BMI &ge;31 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> were 46 percent less likely to develop breast cancer than those with a BMI &lt;21 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

For postmenopausal women, the correlation between an increased risk for breast cancer and increasing hormone levels (eg, estradiol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a>) has been consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>]. Further support of a role for estrogen and an increased risk of breast cancer come from the finding that reducing estrogen levels (eg, with the administration of aromatase inhibitors) reduces the risk of breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H9303037\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p>The limited data suggest that estrogen levels also play a role in the development of breast cancer among premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In a study nested within the Nurses&rsquo; Health study that included 591 premenopausal women (197 subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer), women in the highest quartile for serum estrogen levels had an increased breast cancer risk compared with those in the lowest quartile (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In an analysis of premenopausal estrogens of 634 women who were diagnosed with breast cancers both before and after menopause, there was no association between <strong>follicular</strong> estradiol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a>, and free estradiol and risk of either total or invasive breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, higher levels of <strong>luteal</strong> estradiol was positively associated with estrogen receptor positive <span class=\"nowrap\">(ER+)/progesterone</span> receptor positive (PR+) cancers (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.9, ptrend = 0.02). Luteal estrone, free estradiol, and progesterone were not associated with risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15459287\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast pathology</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33002095\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign breast disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide spectrum of pathologic entities is included in the category of benign breast disease.

Breast density is a measure of the extent of radiodense fibroglandular tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Women with mammographically dense breast tissue, generally defined as dense tissue comprising &ge;75 percent of the breast, have a four to five times risk of breast cancer compared with women of similar age with less or no dense tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. In addition, longitudinal increases or decreases in breast density on serial screening mammography are associated with an increased or decreased risk of breast cancer, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, increased breast density is not associated with mortality from breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It is also unclear whether screening recommendations should differ for women with dense breasts in the absence of other risk factors.

In one study involving 44,811 participants in the San Francisco Mammography Registry, breast cancers arising in the context of dense breast tissue were as likely to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, 95% CI 1.64-3.04) as they were to be ER negative (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.16-4.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Although breast density is a largely inherited trait, exogenous hormones can influence density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. For example, postmenopausal estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy increased breast density, while estrogen receptor antagonists (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>) decrease breast density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].
