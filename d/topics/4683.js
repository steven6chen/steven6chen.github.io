The high prevalence of TB worldwide, its transmissible nature, and the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this infection account for the status of TB as a major public health concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The clinical findings vary; inflammatory papules, verrucous plaques, suppurative nodules, chronic ulcers, or other lesions may be seen.

The method of infection is the characteristic most often used to subdivide the disorders. Although most cases arise from contiguous spread or hematogenous dissemination to the skin from an endogenous focus of infection, direct entry of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> into the skin occasionally results in localized infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].

The <strong>paucibacillary</strong> forms (bacilli hard to detect in tissue or exudate) of cutaneous TB include tuberculosis verrucosa cutis and lupus vulgaris. </p><p>The <strong>tuberculids</strong> are a separate category of TB-associated cutaneous disorders that likely represent hypersensitivity reactions to mycobacterial antigens, rather than manifestations of local skin infection. The disorders included in the category of tuberculids include papulonecrotic tuberculid, lichen scrofulosorum, and erythema induratum of Bazin.

As examples, primary inoculation TB, scrofuloderma, and lichen scrofulosorum commonly affect children, and females are more likely than males to develop lupus vulgaris and erythema induratum of Bazin. In addition, the presence of poor immunity against <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is a risk factor for tuberculosis cutis orificialis, metastatic tuberculous abscess, and acute miliary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>].

Although tuberculoid granulomas are a common finding in cutaneous TB, their detection does not confirm the presence of TB, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis. Leprosy, tertiary syphilis, granulomatous rosacea, leishmaniasis, deep fungal infections, and other disorders may also present with tuberculoid granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis/abstract/11,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23,24</a>]. </p><p>The classic granulomas of sarcoidosis differ from tuberculoid granulomas. Compared with tuberculoid granulomas, sarcoidal granulomas tend to be more circumscribed, exhibit fewer peripheral inflammatory cells (so-called &quot;naked granulomas&quot;), and are less likely to have central caseation necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80383%7EDERM%2F54204\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80383 graphicRef54204 \">picture 2A-B</a>).

The conventional techniques include mycobacterial culture (the gold standard for diagnosis), stained smears, lesional biopsies, and tuberculin skin testing. However, in paucibacillary variants, culture, smears, and histopathology often fail to detect the presence of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> due to the relatively low number of organisms in lesional tissue. Such tests also are not typically useful for the diagnosis of tuberculids, in which mycobacteria generally are not detected in skin lesions. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> can be positive in both multibacillary and paucibacillary forms of cutaneous TB; however, a positive test only identifies individuals who have been sensitized to TB and does not confirm active TB infection.</p><p>Newer techniques that have been developed for the evaluation of patients with suspected TB include interferon-gamma release assays, which, like the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a>, identify patients who have been exposed to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, and nucleic amplification tests (eg, polymerase chain reaction) that identify mycobacterial DNA in lesional tissue. The role that these newer techniques should play in the diagnosis of cutaneous TB remains uncertain.

In general, treatment should be continued for at least two months following the complete resolution of skin lesions. </p><p>Surgical intervention is not routinely utilized for the management of cutaneous TB, but is sometimes employed as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Surgical excision has been utilized to aid in the management of extensive or recalcitrant scrofuloderma. In addition, surgical excision, cauterization, and cryosurgery have been performed to hasten the resolution of small, early lesions of TBVC and lupus vulgaris. Reconstructive plastic surgery after treatment can be beneficial for patients with destructive lesions of lupus vulgaris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis/abstract/11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763973\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763980\"><span class=\"h2\">BCG vaccination reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine is composed of a living attenuated strain of <em>M. bovis</em> that is used in many parts of the world to enhance immunity to TB.

(See <a href=\"#H494532\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous TB may result from direct entry of the mycobacterium into the skin or from local or hematogenous spread of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from an endogenous focus. The immune response of the host to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is an important factor in the development of cutaneous TB. (See <a href=\"#H494532\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22503353\" class=\"local\">'Clinical variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of diagnostic studies are used for the evaluation of patients with suspected cutaneous TB. Mycobacterial cultures represent the gold standard for confirming active infection. Other studies that may be utilized for patient evaluation include stained smears, histopathologic evaluation, tuberculin skin tests, interferon-gamma release assays, and nucleic acid amplification tests. (See <a href=\"#H494576\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tuberculids are a group of cutaneous disorders that may reflect hypersensitivity reactions to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> antigens. The three main subtypes of tuberculids are papulonecrotic tuberculid, lichen scrofulosorum, and erythema induratum of Bazin. Organisms usually are not detectable in cultures, smears, or pathology specimens taken from tuberculid skin lesions. (See <a href=\"#H22503411\" class=\"local\">'Tuberculids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the plethora of manifestations of cutaneous tuberculosis, a high index of suspicion is of utmost importance in making the correct diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic treatment with multidrug therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of cutaneous TB. (See <a href=\"#H606441\" class=\"local\">'Treatment overview'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">L&ouml;nnroth K, Raviglione M.
