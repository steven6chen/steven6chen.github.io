It is the most commonly prescribed delivery system for administering inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Spacer devices, when used properly, substantially improve the delivery of pMDI-generated aerosols to the distal airways. The pMDI, used alone or in combination with a spacer or valved-holding chamber, is the most convenient and cost-effective way to administer aerosolized medications for most patients.</p><p>Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are a separate group of medication aerosolizing devices widely used in the management of adult and pediatric pulmonary disease. These devices eliminate the need for propellants and are less dependent upon coordination of inhalation and device actuation. Short- and long-acting beta agonists and inhaled glucocorticoids are available for administration via DPIs.</p><p>The effectiveness of both delivery systems is dependent upon several factors, including the properties of the agent administered, design, temperature, humidity, and patient technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Device technique should be assessed during every encounter to ensure optimal use and drug delivery to the lungs. The use of pMDIs and DPIs in children is discussed here. Other aspects of aerosol therapy, including the use of nebulizers, are presented separately.

In some cases (such as with HFA <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">beclomethasone</a>), the use of HFA has increased the output of respirable particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], improved the delivery of drug to the lower airways, and decreased deposition in the oropharynx compared with previously used propellants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Improved delivery to peripheral airways may necessitate the reduction of drug dose, particularly when using an inhaled glucocorticoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Spacer devices'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">pMDI technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advantages of aerosol delivery using a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) include convenient multidosing, portability, low cost, and a low risk of bacterial contamination. However, correct coordination of actuation and inspiration is crucial and may be difficult for young children, patients with severe muscle weakness, or patients with hand deformities. Improper technique can increase oropharyngeal drug deposition and side effects.</p><p>The effective delivery of drugs by pMDIs is technique dependent. Unfortunately, up to two-thirds of patients and health care professionals who administer pMDI treatment do not use proper technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/2,9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-13</a>].

Priming involves the discharging of one or more doses of medication prior to use. pMDIs have extra doses to account for the initial priming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Additional priming may be recommended by the manufacturer if a period of time has elapsed between uses or if the pMDI is dropped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Determining when an MDI is empty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for the patient to have a means to determine when the canister is empty. It is not possible to determine when a metered dose inhaler (MDI) canister is empty by shaking it, because some propellant remains in the canister after all of the medication has been used. A few MDIs are now manufactured with integrated dose counters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51750 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another method of determining when the canister is empty is to have the patient maintain a log of the number of actuations and to dispose of the device when the designated number of actuations has been reached or upon expiration, whichever is sooner. The technique of dropping the canister into a pan of water and observing how it floats is unreliable and is no longer recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Spacers and holding chambers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most problems associated with pMDI use, such as the need for coordination of actuation and inhalation, are related to the high velocity of discharge of particles from the nozzle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/4,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,19</a>]. The attachment of a spacer to the pMDI decreases the velocity of particles and largely eliminates the need for coordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/2,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,19</a>]. A spacer is usually an open-ended tube or bag that is of sufficient volume to allow the aerosol plume from the pMDI to expand, the propellant to evaporate, and large particles to settle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58957 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence that adding a spacer improves drug delivery or efficacy as compared with a correctly used pMDI alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], but the addition of a spacer does correct for poor pMDI technique in most patients and allows faster resolution of symptoms in children with acute asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/2,19,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,22-25</a>]. In addition, using a spacer markedly decreases oropharyngeal drug deposition and may reduce both oral and systemic side effects, especially when used with inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/19,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26,27</a>].</p><p>The use of a spacer or valved-holding chamber is recommended for all children in whom proper breath and actuation coordination is difficult (particularly those who are younger than five to six years) and whenever an inhaled glucocorticoid is being administered via a pMDI. A valved-holding chamber with a mask is recommended for younger children, especially those under three years of age. Most children can be successfully changed to a chamber with mouthpiece as they get older. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-treatment-of-persistent-asthma-with-controller-medications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Treatment of persistent asthma with controller medications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Spacer devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spacer should be at least 100 to 700 mL in volume and should provide a distance of 10 to 13 cm between the pMDI nozzle and the mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a randomized crossover study of spacers with facemasks in children aged 10 to 25 months, a smaller volume 140 mL Aerochamber was less effective than the larger volume 260 mL Babyspacer and 750 mL Nebuhaler (filter dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a> 39.4, 53.5, and 55.5 mcg, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, using a large-volume spacer device may require longer administration times (up to 30 seconds) to empty the spacer. In another study of spacers without facemasks, children two to seven years of age had inhalation volumes nearly double the expected tidal volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Two tidal breaths were sufficient for the smaller-volume spacers (149 mL Aerochamber Plus and 225 mL Funhaler) and a 500 mL modified plastic soft drink bottle, but three tidal breaths were required for the larger-volume spacer (750 mL Volumatic). Additional tidal breaths did not significantly increase drug delivery. Drug delivery was otherwise equivalent among the four devices. The modified 500 to 1000 mL plastic bottle is an approach that may be particularly useful in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p>A number of spacer devices are commercially available. Examples of these include Inspirease, Aerochamber, Nebuhaler, ACE, VORTEX, and OptiHaler, among others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58957 \">picture 3</a>). The various spacers differ mainly with regard to size, shape, presence of a valve, and use of an inspiratory flow alarm (signaling too rapid inspiration).</p><p>Plastic spacers have electrostatic charges within the chamber that attract particles and significantly reduce drug delivery to the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/5,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,34-37</a>]. This effect may be particularly important when starting bronchodilator therapy in acute asthma. One option is to use a nonelectrostatic metal spacer, where available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Alternatively, the electrostatic charge within the plastic spacer can be reduced by washing the spacer in a dilute solution (1:5000 or three to four drops in a gallon of water) of dishwashing detergent, without subsequent rinsing, prior to its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/36,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40-42</a>]. The spacer also can be primed with several doses (10 to 20) of drug with the initial use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/5,36,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,36,43</a>], but this method generally is impractical given drug costs and limitations on refills, particularly with controller medications. These treatments improve drug delivery by as much as fourfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/40,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Valved-holding chambers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The valved-holding chamber is a specialized spacer that incorporates a one-way valve that permits aerosol removal from the chamber during inhalation and holds particles in the chamber during exhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These devices can be fitted with a mouthpiece or a size-appropriate facemask, making them suitable for use in infants and young children. When using a facemask, it is important that it is well sealed and that dead space volume is minimized to assure optimal drug delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. Flexible masks appear to provide better seals and are associated with smaller dead space volume than rigid masks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. There is some evidence that a valved spacer may <strong>not</strong> be appropriate when using a pMDI in newborns and very small infants, due to their inability to reliably generate the inspiratory flow necessary to open the valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

In one study, almost half of parents received inadequate instruction in spacer use for infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Although most of the parents thought that the procedure was easy to understand, errors that affected the efficiency of medication administration were common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The optimal technique for using a pMDI with spacer or valved-holding chamber is reviewed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/2,37,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37,52</a>].

In addition, a dry powder formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tobramycin</a> is available for patients six years of age and older who have cystic fibrosis and are colonized with <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. A number of different types of DPIs are commercially available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58951 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57922 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>There is a simple way to assess the ability of a child to use a DPI using a paper tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. A tissue is held in both hands and placed over the open mouth. The patient then inhales forcefully, creating a vacuum that keeps the tissue in place after letting go of the tissue. The goal is to keep the tissue in place on the mouth for five seconds while breathing in without holding the tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4219063401\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing adequacy of inspiratory pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may influence the efficiency of drug delivery by DPIs. The age of the child and presence of asthma symptoms affect peak inspiratory flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/76,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,78</a>]. In addition, the design of the device affects the resistance to inspiration and the inspiratory flow required to aerosolize the medication. For instance, the Diskus is reliable at both low and high flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/76,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,79</a>] and may be suitable for use in children as young as four years of age and patients with severely impaired lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] less than 30 percent predicted) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. In contrast, high-resistance devices, such as the Turbuhaler, require greater inspiratory flow to efficiently aerosolize a high percentage of the nominal dose and are not as reliable at lower inspiratory flow rates or in patients with severe airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. However, the Turbuhaler may provide better drug deposition to the lower airways if flow rate is adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children/abstract/3,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The effectiveness of both delivery systems is dependent upon several factors, including the properties of the agent administered, design, temperature, humidity, and patient technique. Device technique should be assessed during every encounter to ensure optimal use and drug delivery to the lungs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of inhaled medication in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pMDI contains drug, which is usually either crystallized or in solution, along with the propellant and a surfactant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62613 \">picture 1</a>). Advantages of aerosol delivery using a pMDI include convenient multidosing, portability, and a low risk of bacterial contamination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52016 \">table 4</a>). However, correct coordination of actuation and inspiration is crucial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 2</a>) and may be difficult for young children, patients with severe muscle weakness, or patients with hand deformities. Improper technique can increase oropharyngeal drug deposition and side effects. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pressurized metered dose inhalers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most problems associated with pMDI use, such as the need for coordination of actuation and inhalation, are related to the high velocity of discharge of particles from the nozzle. The attachment of a spacer or valved-holding chamber to the pMDI decreases the velocity of particles and largely eliminates the need for coordination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 2</a>). A spacer is usually an open-ended tube or bag that is of sufficient volume to allow the aerosol plume from the pMDI to expand, the propellant to evaporate, and large particles to settle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58957 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Spacers and holding chambers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many clinical trials and meta-analyses indicate that the administration of beta agonists via pMDI with spacer is at least as effective as, and possibly superior to, delivery of medication by jet nebulizer in reversing acute bronchospasm in infants and children. In addition, patients using a pMDI with spacer may experience fewer side effects compared with those using a jet nebulizer. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pressurized MDI or nebulizer?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A DPI is a breath-actuated device containing micronized drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58951 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57922 \">picture 4</a>). These devices eliminate the need for propellants and are less dependent on coordination of inhalation and device actuation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52016 \">table 4</a>). However, relatively high inspiratory flow rates are required to deaggregate and aerosolize the drug.
