As the lifespan of HIV-infected patients has increased, malignancies have become a known cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. </p><p>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of high-grade pathologic type and of B cell or unknown immunologic phenotype is an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancy. AIDS-related NHL can be divided into three general categories based on location:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic NHL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary effusion (or body cavity) lymphoma</p><p/><p>Systemic NHL accounts for the great majority of AIDS-related lymphomas. In contrast, primary CNS lymphoma, in which disease is limited to the CNS, comprises approximately 10 percent of AIDS-related lymphomas, while primary effusion lymphoma is much less common. The latter disorder is characterized by its predilection for body cavities such as the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial spaces without an identifiable tumor mass. </p><p>The treatment of systemic NHL in the setting of HIV is complicated by the patient's immunocompromised state and the need to treat HIV concurrently. The treatment of AIDS-related systemic NHL will be reviewed here. The treatment of aggressive and highly aggressive NHL in the absence of HIV is presented separately, as are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiology and pathobiology of AIDS-related lymphoma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of AIDS-related lymphoma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of systemic lymphoma&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary CNS lymphoma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Primary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary effusion lymphoma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Primary effusion lymphoma&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other AIDS-defining malignancies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6051206\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 70 to 90 percent of the lymphomas encountered in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are clinically aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) or highly aggressive Burkitt-like lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At least 80 percent of these patients with systemic lymphoma have stage IV disease at the time of presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], with the most common extranodal sites of involvement being the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, bone marrow, and the central nervous system.

However, the standard concomitant administration of ART may improve bone marrow function by decreasing the adverse effects of the HIV infection on hematopoiesis, thereby allowing for full dosing of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy produces a significant and sustained reduction in CD4 cell counts and an increased risk (twofold in one study) of opportunistic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy exceeds the duration of exposure to these drugs by many months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications taken to control the HIV infection may have side effects that overlap with chemotherapy side effects (eg, myelosuppression).

Recent experience in the ART era strongly suggests that HIV-associated aggressive lymphomas can be treated successfully with standard chemotherapy regimens without unusually severe toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Even high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (hematopoietic cell transplantation) has been well-tolerated in this patient population and is becoming more widely used. (See <a href=\"#H4261248\" class=\"local\">'Autologous transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to the advent of ART, randomized studies did not show any advantage in those treated with more intensive chemotherapy versus standard or reduced-dose regimens, in terms of response rates, time to progression, and median survival among patients with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, a potential benefit from intensive chemotherapy may have been masked by an increase in opportunistic infections in those receiving intensive therapy. Opportunistic infections are less common in this setting now that the underlying HIV infection can be better controlled with ART. (See <a href=\"#H62463420\" class=\"local\">'Incorporating ART'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6237308\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To best treat patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the initial evaluation must establish the precise histologic subtype, the extent and sites of disease, and the performance status of the patient. General approaches to the diagnostic work-up and staging of NHL are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the extent of the disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with AIDS-related systemic NHL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, phosphate, CD4 count, viral load, hepatitis B and C screening, and pregnancy test (in women).

(See <a href=\"#H1701337\" class=\"local\">'CNS directed therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of cardiac ejection fraction (eg, echocardiogram or MUGA) should be performed for most patients and is necessary prior to regimens that include highly cardiotoxic drugs (eg, anthracyclines). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> should be performed, which provides critical information on the measurement of disease prior to treatment and aids in staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When compared with the HIV-positive population, false positive results may be more likely in a patient with a high viral load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Routine imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1226113\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal initial therapy for lymphomas in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be defined. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is started or modified (if already begun) to control the HIV infection and allow for the administration of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy. As in the HIV-seronegative population, the choice of therapy is principally determined by the subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and the stage of disease. Modifications are made based upon the degree of immunosuppression from HIV as measured by the CD4 count.</p><p>As in the HIV-seronegative population, attention needs to be given to serum uric acid levels and other potential complications of the tumor lysis syndrome at the time of diagnosis and with the first cycle of cytotoxic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

These expectations have largely been borne out in retrospective and prospective clinical data collected since the advent of ART. ART is an essential component to the treatment of patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. ART should be continued during chemotherapy, with an undetectable blood viral load being the targeted goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Since the incorporation of ART, there has been a decrease in the number of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections that develop during or shortly after completing chemotherapy. As an example, approximately 20 percent of patients treated with chemotherapy for AIDS-related NHL in a large prospective trial conducted in the pre-ART era developed AIDS-defining opportunistic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, opportunistic infections have been infrequently reported in more recent clinical trials in which ART has been administered with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/11,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16-20</a>]. </p><p>Concomitant administration of ART during chemotherapy for AIDS-related lymphoma also appears to improve overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/11,16-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16-26</a>]. Improvements in immune function rendered by ART diminish the effects of HIV on survival allowing the prognostic features of the lymphoma to become relatively more important to overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In studies conducted in the ART era, advanced disease, as determined by stage or International Prognostic Index score (IPI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>), appears to have greater prognostic value than factors associated with HIV disease such as immune function and prior opportunistic infection. Most clinical trials, however, continue to identify a CD4 count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100/microL</span> as a negative prognostic finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pooled analysis of individual patient data from 1546 patients from 19 prospective clinical trials performed between 1989 and 2010 reported that the concurrent use of ART with chemotherapy was associated with superior complete remission rates (odds ratio 1.89; 95% CI 1.21-2.93) and a trend towards improved overall survival (hazard ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.60-1.02, p = 0.07) in multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study evaluated patients with AIDS-related lymphoma treated either with one of two combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CHOP chemotherapy plus ART (CHOP-ART, 24 patients) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CHOP or a CHOP-like regimen with no ART or AZT monotherapy (CHOP, 80 patients) <br/><br/>At a median follow-up of 7 to 8.5 months, the incidence of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection was significantly lower in the CHOP-ART group (18 versus 52 percent), and overall survival was significantly longer (median survival not reached versus seven months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A German study demonstrated treatment outcomes using CHOP and concurrent ART that were similar to those observed in non-HIV patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), with a complete response rate of 79 percent and median survival not reached after a median of 47 months follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although these results are comparable to those observed in non-immunocompromised patients, it should be pointed out that this patient population had a higher median CD4 count <span class=\"nowrap\">(223/microL)</span> and lower IPI score than other studies.</p><p/><p>The response to ART has been shown to be an independent risk factor for survival in patients with AIDS-related NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31</a>]. In a study of 44 patients from two Italian treatment centers, virologic response to ART was the only variable independently associated with attainment of complete remission following chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Overall one-year survival for the entire group was 49 percent, increasing to 78 percent for virologic responders, and 84 percent among those who achieved immunologic restoration. Other studies support the importance of ART as a prognostic factor with respect to complete response rate and event-free survival of those treated with CHOP chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1225504\" class=\"local\">'Effect of ART'</a> below.)</p><p>With few exceptions, studies have shown that concomitant ART and antineoplastic chemotherapy have no clinically adverse effects on the metabolism of drugs in either the antiretroviral or conventional-dose antineoplastic regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/15,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33,34</a>]. There are few data to support one antiretroviral regimen over another. However, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> is strongly discouraged due to the risk of overlapping myelotoxicity. </p><p>Studies that have evaluated interactions between protease inhibitors and chemotherapy have had mixed results. One study has shown no statistically significant difference between ART regimens containing protease inhibitors versus those not containing protease inhibitors with respect to response rates or survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, protease inhibitor containing regimens may potentiate the myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen compared with antiretroviral regimens that do not contain a protease inhibitor. This is likely due to CYP3A inhibition by specific protease inhibitors. Even at lower doses, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that can be used to &quot;boost&quot; levels of other protease inhibitors. Although use of these agents concomitantly with conventional dose chemotherapy is not contraindicated, alternatives might be considered, especially if more aggressive or high-dose chemotherapy regimens are to be utilized. The use of raltegravir-based regimens (integrase inhibitor) might represent a good alternative as it does not have hepatic metabolism and thus the potential for drug interactions may be lessened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The CD4 count may decline by at least 50 percent from the baseline during chemotherapy for AIDS-related NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], necessitating the use of prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in all patients. Although this effect on the CD4 counts may exceed the duration of the chemotherapy by several months, those patients receiving ART concurrent with chemotherapy reconstitute CD4 counts more rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In one study the cohort of 20 patients with AIDS-related NHL treated with chemotherapy and concomitant ART recovered CD4 and NK cells counts to baseline within one month after completion of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In contrast, 12 months were required for recovery following treatment with EPOCH without concomitant ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The combination of ART with chemotherapy maintains the virologic response in the majority of patients, while the development of resistance mutations in the HIV does not seem to be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62464350\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylaxis for opportunistic infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During treatment with combination chemotherapy, ART should be continued along with prophylaxis for <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP, previously <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> pneumonia). Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis may be appropriate for selected patients with severe immunocompromise (ie, CD4 <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50/microL)</span>. Antibiotic prophylaxis for enteric organisms during neutropenia is strongly encouraged. Given the high incidence of recurrent herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and <em>Candida </em>infections in this population, many clinicians also advise instituting antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis.

HIV-seronegative patients with Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia</span> are typically treated with intensive, short-duration combination chemotherapy with central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis.

The modifications intensified the treatment of leptomeningeal disease if present at diagnosis and included measures to reduce mucositis and hematologic and neurologic toxicity. Most patients were able to receive the intended treatment and 12 percent discontinued therapy early due to toxicity. Severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> neurotoxicity and hematologic toxicity occurred in 21 and 59 percent, respectively. One-quarter developed neutropenic fever and there was one treatment-related death. Estimated progression-free survival at one year was 69 percent and overall survival at one and two years was 72 and 69 percent, respectively. Similar rates were seen in the 19 patients whose Burkitt lymphoma was confirmed on central pathologic review. The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> did not appear to increase toxicity. The results of this study compare favorably with results in non-immunocompromised patients treated with the same regimen in previous trials.</p><p>A randomized phase II trial of dose-adjusted infusional chemotherapy with the EPOCH regimen plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (R-daEPOCH) conducted by the AIDS Malignancies Consortium included 27 patients with Burkitt lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These patients did well with this regimen in conjunction with concurrent rituximab. However, further study of this regimen is required before definitive recommendations regarding its use in Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia</span> can be made. One concern is the lack of CNS-penetrating systemic chemotherapy in the daEPOCH regimen given the high risk of leptomeningeal involvement in HIV patients with Burkitt lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dose-adjusted EPOCH plus rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p>In a single arm prospective trial, 11 patients (median age 44 years) with immunodeficiency-associated BL were treated with a fixed-dose EPOCH-R for three to six cycles (one cycle past complete response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Most cycles were administered in the outpatient setting. All patients also received G-CSF support and central nervous system prophylaxis with intrathecal chemotherapy. Neutropenic fever occurred in 20 percent of cycles. After a median follow-up of 73 months, the estimated rates of freedom from progression (100 percent; 95% CI 72-100 percent) and overall survival (90 percent; 95% CI 60-98 percent) at six years were high. However, the number of patients treated is exceedingly small, and no patient in this group had CNS involvement, a significant factor when considering the use of a treatment regimen that does not include systemic CNS-penetrating therapy. Until more data from an ongoing multicenter trial become available, we prefer the <span class=\"nowrap\">R-CODOX-M/IVAC</span> regimen with concurrent ART.</p><p>CNS prophylaxis is a key component to the treatment of patients with Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia</span>.

In particular, it is recommended that ART be interrupted during the administration of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. This decision should be individualized based upon the specific ART combination used. During treatment, ART should be continued if tolerated, however, if significant gastrointestinal toxicity is observed and resulting in the inconsistent use of antivirals, ART therapy may be discontinued for the duration of chemotherapy and restarted once chemotherapy is completed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1224066\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasmablastic lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasmablastic lymphoma is a less common but highly aggressive lymphoma observed in the setting of HIV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Treatment of CNS and primary effusion lymphoma is addressed separately.

Given the high incidence of recurrent herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and <em>Candida</em> infections in this population, many clinicians also advise instituting antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dose-adjusted EPOCH plus rituximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture should be performed at diagnosis in the setting of &gt;2 extranodal sites of disease accompanied by elevated LDH, or specific high-risk sites such as paranasal sinuses, testes, epidural space, and bone marrow. CNS prophylaxis is not routinely administered. (See <a href=\"#H1701337\" class=\"local\">'CNS directed therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'AIDS-related lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p>We take the following approach for patients with Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia</span>. A similar approach may be used for patients with immunoblastic lymphoma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia,</span> we suggest the <span class=\"nowrap\">R-CODOX-M/IVAC</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72511 \">table 4</a>) regimen rather than R-CHOP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternatively, infusional chemotherapy with dose-adjusted EPOCH plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may be considered for individuals who may not tolerate the more aggressive <span class=\"nowrap\">R-CODOX-M/IVAC</span> regimen. However, we do not advocate the use of this regimen for most patients, particularly for patients with CNS involvement, because clinical trial data regarding its use in Burkitt lymphoma is limited. (See <a href=\"#H1224044\" class=\"local\">'Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dose-adjusted EPOCH plus rituximab'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During treatment, ART should be continued, if tolerated, along with <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP, previously <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> pneumonia) prophylaxis, and antibiotic prophylaxis for enteric organisms. If significant gastrointestinal toxicity is observed and resulting in the inconsistent use of antivirals, ART therapy may be discontinued for the duration of chemotherapy and restarted once chemotherapy is completed. Given the high incidence of recurrent herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and <em>Candida</em> infections in this population, many clinicians also advise instituting antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of infection during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in high-risk adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in adults with hematologic malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should undergo lumbar puncture at diagnosis. Patients with Burkitt lymphoma and no evidence of leptomeningeal involvement should have CNS prophylaxis, with intrathecal chemotherapy and systemic administration of high doses of antineoplastic agents that cross the blood-brain barrier. (See <a href=\"#H1701337\" class=\"local\">'CNS directed therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Although few patients diagnosed early in the HIV epidemic were cured of their lymphoma, the introduction of ART in the late 1990s resulted in a marked improvement in the ability of these patients to tolerate standard chemotherapy regimens and clinical outcomes that now approach those in the general population. (See <a href=\"#H1225476\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p>Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a treatment option for select patients with relapsed AIDS-related non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma demonstrating sensitivity to second-line chemotherapy. The role of allogeneic HCT in AIDS-related lymphoma is less clear given the paucity of published data. Otherwise, chemotherapy protocols that contain agents that are not cross-resistant with those previously administered can be considered. Ideally, if available, the patient should be referred for an investigational treatment protocol.
