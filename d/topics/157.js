The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Another term for acid reflux is &quot;gastroesophageal reflux disease,&quot; or GERD.</p><p>Many women get acid reflux during pregnancy. Acid reflux usually gets worse over the course of the pregnancy. It usually goes away after the baby is born.</p><p>Women who have acid reflux in one pregnancy are likely to get it again in future pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090421\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acid reflux during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of acid reflux during pregnancy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the chest, known as heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the throat or an acid taste in the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach or chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A raspy voice or sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090436\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by talking with you and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090451\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to improve my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help with your symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid lying down within 3 hours of eating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid eating within 3 hours of bedtime.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid foods that make your symptoms worse. Foods that commonly make acid reflux worse are coffee, cola, tea, citrus foods, chocolate, and fatty foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the head of your bed by 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm). You can do this by putting blocks of wood or rubber under 2 legs of the bed or using a Styrofoam wedge under your pillow.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090466\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there treatments that can help reduce symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are 4 main types of medicines that can reduce acid reflux symptoms. They are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antacids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surface agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histamine blockers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proton pump inhibitors</p><p/><p>All of these medicines work by reducing or blocking stomach acid. But each of them does that in a different way (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78918 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Doctors usually recommend that pregnant women first try antacids to reduce their symptoms. Most antacids are considered safe in pregnancy, but some are not. If you are pregnant, do not take antacids that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sodium bicarbonate</a> and magnesium trisilicate. You can buy antacids without a prescription.</p><p>If antacids don't help enough, let your doctor or nurse know. He or she might recommend that you try a surface agent, histamine blocker, or proton pump inhibitor. These medicines work better than antacids to reduce symptoms. You can buy most histamine blockers and some proton pump inhibitors without a prescription.</p><p>Before you use any over-the-counter medicines for acid reflux, talk to your doctor or nurse. He or she can tell you which ones are safe to use during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090481\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe heartburn or chest pain, or these symptoms don't get better with treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting with your heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choke when you eat, have trouble swallowing, or feel like food is getting &quot;stuck&quot; on the way down your throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight without trying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit bright red blood or material that looks like coffee grounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have bowel movements that look like black tar</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12090496\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-over-the-counter-medicines-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking over-the-counter medicines during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-symptoms-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pregnancy symptoms (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
