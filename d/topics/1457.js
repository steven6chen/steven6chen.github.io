These symptoms occur periodically, usually related to specific triggering events. The small airways of people with asthma narrow during these episodes; the narrowing is partially or completely reversible with asthma treatments. In addition, the airways in patients with asthma react to a variety of stimuli, which may include viral illnesses (eg, the common cold), exercise, inhalant or food allergens to which the patient is allergic, or environmental conditions.</p><p>Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children in developed countries, affecting approximately 12 percent of children who are less than 18 years of age. It is more common in males than females under the age of 15 years.</p><p>This topic review discusses the risk factors, symptoms, and diagnosis of asthma in children. Other topics about asthma in children are available separately.

This narrowing is almost always completely reversible with treatment in children. Many different genetic, infectious, and environmental factors may increase the risk of developing asthma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for asthma&quot;</a>), a few of which include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral infections &ndash; Children who have wheezing with respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus seem to be at increased risk for developing asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pollution &ndash; Increased exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution may increase the risk of developing asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to tobacco smoke &ndash; Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and throughout childhood increases the risk of developing asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history &ndash; Children with a personal or family history of certain medical problems, such as asthma, allergies, or eczema, are at increased risk of developing asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress &ndash; Severely negative life events in children increase the risk of asthma attacks over the subsequent few weeks.</p><p/><p>However, not all children with asthma have known risk factors. In other words, even children who live in unpolluted areas and whose parents do not smoke or have asthma can develop asthma. It is not clear if there are ways to reduce a child's risk of developing asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Coughing and wheezing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of asthma in children include coughing and wheezing. The cough is usually dry and hacking and is most noticeable while the child sleeps and during early morning hours. It may also be triggered by exercise or cold air exposure. Wheezing is a high-pitched, musical noise that is usually heard when the child breathes out. It can generally only be heard with a stethoscope.</p><p>Coughing and wheezing tend to come and go during the day or night, depending upon the degree of airway narrowing in the lungs. Breathlessness, chest tightness or pressure, and chest pain may also occur. In addition to coughing or wheezing, a child may report that his or her chest or stomach hurts.</p><p>Asthma symptoms often develop in children before five years of age, although it is sometimes difficult to diagnose asthma in infants and toddlers. Up to a third of children under three years of age will cough and wheeze with colds, but many of them will not go on to have asthma. Thus, the diagnosis is usually established when the patient continues to have recurrent episodes after turning three years of age. Documentation of reversible obstruction, most often seen during an acute episode, helps to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wheezing phenotypes and prediction of asthma in young children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wheezing and coughing may occur at any time, but certain triggers are known to worsen asthma in many children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Environmental conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold air, changes in barometric pressure, rain, or wind may cause increased asthma symptoms in certain people. Pollution, including exhaust fumes and particulate matter, may also induce symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper respiratory infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral upper respiratory infections (head and chest colds) are a common trigger of asthma in infants and young children. The most common viral infections include rhinovirus (the virus that causes most colds), respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with asthma should use their asthma treatments for cough and chest congestion rather than over-the-counter cold remedies, which are not effective therapies for asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narrowing of the airways can be triggered by exercise. This is called exercise-induced asthma (also called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or EIB). Breathlessness, wheeze, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cough usually occur within 5 to 10 minutes of the cool-down period after vigorous exercise but may occur during exercise. These symptoms tend to disappear after 20 to 45 minutes. Certain types of exercise (eg, swimming) are less likely to cause exercise-induced asthma than others (eg, running, skating), probably because they produce less airway cooling and drying. Short bursts of activity tend to be better tolerated than prolonged exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergens and irritants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indoor and outdoor allergens are an important trigger of childhood asthma, particularly for children older than three years of age. In children with seasonal allergies, asthma symptoms may worsen during certain pollen seasons. Symptoms can also flare as a result of mold exposure (eg, during rainy seasons or in damp areas). Indoor pollutants can act as irritants and also trigger asthma symptoms. Irritants and allergens include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>House dust (ie, dust mites, cockroaches, mice droppings), particularly during vacuuming</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal exposures; cats and dogs are especially provocative, but other furry animals (gerbils, rabbits, hamsters, etc) may be suspect, particularly if symptoms only occur in settings where these animals reside</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pollens (the pollen season and types of pollen vary depending upon the region and climate)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indoor pollutants (eg, paint, perfume, cleaning products, space heaters, gas stoves, room deodorizers)</p><p/><p>If allergies are a possible cause of symptoms, skin or blood testing may be recommended. This can help to both identify triggers and determine the necessity of avoiding these triggers at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with chronic asthma may have one of several distinct patterns of symptoms, and the asthma pattern may change over time:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent asthma attacks with no symptoms between attacks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic symptoms with intermittent worsening</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attacks that become more severe or frequent over time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morning &quot;dipping,&quot; when symptoms worsen in the morning and improve as the day progresses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that begin during upper respiratory tract infections (eg, colds) and linger for several weeks after, with resolution during warmer weather</p><p/><p>Most asthma attacks develop slowly over a period of several days. Uncommonly, a severe attack can occur suddenly, even in someone with intermittent asthma, and with minimal warning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of asthma in children requires a careful review of a child's current and past medical history, family history, and a physical examination. Specialized testing is sometimes needed to diagnose asthma and to rule out other possible causes of symptoms. Many children with asthma appear and sound completely normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Spirometry testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spirometry measures the flow and volume of air blown out after a child takes a very deep breath and then forcefully exhales. If airflow obstruction is present, the test may be repeated after the child uses an asthma inhaler or nebulizer (bronchodilator) to confirm that the obstruction is reversible (a feature of asthma).</p><p>Children younger than six years sometimes have a hard time following the instructions to perform spirometry. Testing of younger children and infants is described below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Testing for young children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Challenge testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bronchial challenge test may be recommended to diagnose asthma. This testing is designed to cause the airways to narrow in children with asthma. The most common challenge tests include inhaling an agent (eg, methacholine) that causes bronchoconstriction, exercise by running on a treadmill or using an exercise cycle, or breathing cold air. Testing is done in a specialized asthma testing center that is capable of providing emergency asthma care if needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests may be recommended to ensure that another condition is not the cause of a child's coughing or wheezing. This may include a chest X-ray, sweat chloride test (for cystic fibrosis), barium swallow (for gastroesophageal reflux), modified barium swallow (for aspiration), or skin or blood testing (for allergies or immune problems).

In some cases, a health care provider may recommend a trial of asthma medication to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA IN ADULTHOOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many parents wonder if their child will &quot;outgrow&quot; their asthma over time.
