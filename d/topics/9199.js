The patient is already on this medication and it is well tolerated without hyperkalemia, a deterioration of renal function, cough, or other complications. It is appropriate to administer this drug at bedtime, in relation to the time of day when the patient is supine, to maximize its benefits and minimize the risk of recurrent symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Continuing the same dose but giving it at a different time minimizes the risk of harm. If this change of timing is tolerated, one can then increase the dose slowly using small increments as tolerated.</p><p>In the patient under consideration, the change in time of administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> to bedtime resulted in a small decrease in supine blood pressure readings to 177 to <span class=\"nowrap\">187/69</span> to 77 mmHg with little or no change in upright blood pressure readings and no recurrence of symptoms.</p><p>A goal for supine systolic blood pressure readings of 160 mmHg was chosen. This is a value that was tolerated by the patient after the cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alfuzosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alfuzosin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> and is approximately 20 mmHg below current readings. It is higher than the goal of &lt;140 mmHg (if this can be achieved without a reduction in the diastolic pressure to &lt;65 mmHg) in patients with systolic hypertension without autonomic orthostatic hypotension (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>). The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> at bedtime was increased incrementally to 15 mg and two weeks later to 20 mg. The supine blood pressure readings fell to 156 to <span class=\"nowrap\">168/68</span> to 78 mmHg with no appreciable change in upright blood pressure readings and without recurrence of symptoms.</p><p>Evaluation and management of this patient is discussed further in the comment card.
