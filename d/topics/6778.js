(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-function-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune function in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple age-related changes contribute to decreased protection from infection in older adults. These changes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in the barriers posed by the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract (and other mucosal linings), permitting invasion by pathogenic organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in cellular and humoral immunity including decreases in specific cell populations, loss of the proliferative capacity of immune cells, and decreased production of specific cytokines (eg, interleukin-2) that leads to increased risk for intracellular pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Impaired signal transduction after cytokine binding is also associated with impaired defense against fungal and viral pathogens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased antibody response to vaccines, related to reductions in toll-like receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], senescence of CD8+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], reductions in na&iuml;ve CD4+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and changes in B-cell biology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired immunoglobulin production and specificity of antibody responses associated with reductions in na&iuml;ve B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p>Immune function is also compromised by the increasing number of concomitant medical problems that occur with aging. Impaired immunity correlates more with an individual&rsquo;s disease burden than chronologic age. Older adults who have chronic diseases (eg, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure) are more susceptible to common infections and exhibit poorer vaccine responses than those who do not have underlying health issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The risk of infection is further exacerbated by communal residence or other social institutions for older persons in developed nations, such as daycare programs or senior centers. Institutionalization is a major risk factor, not only for acquiring disease in general but for acquiring disease due to antibiotic-resistant organisms. Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), fluoroquinolone-resistant <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, and multiply-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are more frequent causes of infection among institutionalized older patients than those who are community-dwelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Patients with indwelling devices are at particularly high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Antibiotic resistance is fostered in the nursing home setting by debilitated hosts, close proximity of residents, and persistent antibiotic pressure. A Canadian study found that 8 to 17 percent of nursing home residents were taking antibiotics at any given time, that 50 to 70 percent were exposed to antibiotics over the course of one year, and that 22 to 89 percent of this antibiotic use was inappropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, in a two-year study of 110,000 nursing home residents in Canada, participants residing in facilities with high rates of antibiotic utilization were more likely to experience an antibiotic-related harm whether or not they had recently received an antibiotic. The authors predicted that one additional antibiotic-related harm would be generated for every 53 patients admitted to a high rather than low antibiotic-utilizing nursing home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Major strategies to enhance antimicrobial stewardship in long-term care include: avoiding treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, specifically addressing antibiotics as an intervention that can be avoided in end-of-life discussions, and focusing on the shortest, effective duration of therapy for specific syndromes (eg, pneumonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498015\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL ISSUES IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498024\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation of disease and prognostic indicators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been known for centuries that older adults can have severe infection in the absence of typical signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Fever, the cardinal feature of infection, is absent in 30 to 50 percent of frail, older adults, even in the setting of serious infections like pneumonia or endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The blunted febrile response in older adults is due to changes in multiple systems responsible for thermoregulation: shivering, vasoconstriction, hypothalamic regulation, and thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue are all impaired with advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Baseline body temperature is often lower than 37&ordm;C in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Postmenopausal women have lower basal body temperatures than premenopausal women, and the presence of dementia, dependence in activities of daily living, or a low body mass index (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> also increase the risk for lower body temperatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Since signs of infection are often atypical in the older adult population and basal body temperature is lower, a rise in temperature from baseline becomes an important indicator of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].</p><p>In addition to the frequent lack of fever, infections in older adults may be associated with a nonspecific decline in baseline functional status such as increased confusion, falling, and anorexia. Due to a lack of infection-specific symptoms, these constitutional symptoms commonly trigger diagnostic testing with subsequent antibiotic prescribing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>Cognitive impairment further contributes to the atypical presentation of infections in older adults, reducing the capacity to communicate symptoms. Clinicians must be ready to pursue objective assessments such as laboratory and radiologic evaluations at a lower threshold in cognitively impaired patients, unless advanced directives and goals of care indicate otherwise.</p><p>Given the often atypical and subtle ways in which infection presents in seniors, there has been substantial interest in biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin to help identify infection. Unfortunately, widely varying cutoffs for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; values have led to wide variation in sensitivity and specificity for these assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In general, they add little to good clinical judgment for initial decision-making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100210296\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relatively healthy, community-dwelling older adults may be appropriately managed using conventional definitions of fever. Fevers &gt;38&deg;C (100.4&ordm;F) indicate a potential for serious infection, while hypothermia relative to baseline body temperatures may signify severe infection or even sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Revision of parameters used to identify &ldquo;fever&rdquo; in frail older adults has been suggested, due to their altered febrile response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/25,26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,31</a>]. Fever in frail older patients may be considered as one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single oral temperature &gt;37.8&deg;C (&gt;100&ordm;F)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent oral or tympanic membrane temperature &ge;37.2&deg;C (99.0&ordm;F)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal temperature &ge;37.5&deg;C (99.5&ordm;F)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rise in temperature of &ge;1.1&deg;C (&ge;2&deg;F) above baseline temperature</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498031\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distribution, metabolism, and excretion of many drugs is altered with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Of all the pharmacokinetic changes observed with advanced age, the most important is a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In a report from the NHANES III study, 38 percent of individuals age 70 or older who did not have hypertension or diabetes had an estimated GFR less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> compared with 0.7 percent of individuals between the ages of 20 and 39 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Renal impairment'</a>.)</p><p>The simple rule &ldquo;start low, go slow&rdquo; is appropriate for dosing most medications in older patients, but <strong>not</strong> antibiotics. Certain antimicrobials (eg, fluoroquinolones) that have concentration-dependent activity work best when levels of drug far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration, and this is more critical for achieving successful outcomes in older adults than in young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Furthermore, revised &rdquo;cut-points&rdquo; used to determine susceptibility to penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, and other beta-lactam drugs are predicated on serum levels achieved by dosing at the higher end of the recommended range. Thus, it is important that older adults with serious infection receive a first antibiotic dose at the highest level with known safety profile, with subsequent dosing to maintain drug levels in the therapeutic range. This may take extra care with older adults in whom calculated creatinine clearance becomes less reliable with age.</p><p>When possible, drug levels should be monitored to avoid toxicity or subtherapeutic dosing. This is particularly important for levels of antibiotics that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as aminoglycosides, with heightened concern in patients with a reduced GFR.</p><p>Patient adherence to prescribed medications may be limited due to many factors that are more common in older adults, including poor cognitive function, impaired hearing or vision, polypharmacy, medication side effects, and economic issues (inability to afford medications).</p><p>The choice of initial antibiotic is not different from that in younger patients for most routine infections. However, special consideration is indicated for older adults, particularly those with indwelling devices, who reside in an institution where multidrug-resistant organisms are prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Additionally, broader initial coverage may be appropriate in seriously ill older adults in whom sepsis, severe pneumonia, or other life-threatening infections are suspected, since outcomes (mortality, length of intensive care unit stay) are improved when the initial antibiotic regimen is effective against the infecting organism or organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Further, older individuals are more likely to have infections from more than one source (eg, genitourinary or gastrointestinal in addition to respiratory or skin). Thus, coverage should be broad until the infecting organisms are identified. (See <a href=\"#H1498045\" class=\"local\">'Bacteremia and sepsis'</a> below.)</p><p>However, use of overly broad treatment is detrimental, engendering antibiotic resistance and potentially increasing the risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> disease. For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an &ldquo;antibiotic time-out&rdquo; 48 hours after initiating antibiotics as one of the core activities to promote antibiotic stewardship and de-escalation to narrow-spectrum therapy if cultures can assist with this decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Prompt institution of antibiotics may be particularly relevant to outcomes in seniors. In older adults with pneumonia, data suggest that delaying initiation of therapy for eight or more hours after admission to the hospital is associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Since this study did not evaluate outcomes in younger patients, it is not known if the effect of delayed antibiotic initiation is more relevant in older compared with younger patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H274615175\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic interactions occur with many medications commonly prescribed in older adults, particularly those drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.

Atrophic gastritis, a common entity in older adults, and use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors can reduce the absorption of some antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>). Drug interactions, such as fluoroquinolones and antacids, may also reduce absorption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498038\"><span class=\"h1\">UNIQUE ASPECTS OF SPECIFIC INFECTIOUS SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following section will review major differences in the causative agents, evaluation, management and prevention of a variety of common infectious syndromes in older adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79173\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79173 \">table 1</a>). This review will not attempt to review all infections affecting older adults. Multiple topics in UpToDate address issues related to these and other infections, including tuberculosis, influenza, osteomyelitis, herpes zoster, and <span class=\"nowrap\">pacemaker/prosthetic</span> valve infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498045\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteremia and sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When compared with young adults, older patients with bacteremia are less likely to have chills or sweating. Fever may be absent but has been reported in 77 to 93 percent of bacteremic older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary sources of bacteremia are more common, and thus isolation of Gram-negative rods is more frequent in older adults, a trend that continues to increase throughout the eighth and ninth decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Bacteremia carries a poor prognosis with advanced age. For example, nosocomial Gram-negative bacteremia has a mortality rate of 5 to 35 percent in young adults and 37 to 50 percent in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Factors contributing to increased mortality in older adults include the use of invasive devices such as intravenous or urinary catheters, presence of coexisting disease, reduced immune response mechanisms leading to more prolonged inflammation, and a greater incidence of end organ damage in the face of a septic episode (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome or renal insufficiency).</p><p>In a case-control study of 830 hospitalized patients aged 65 years and older with a nosocomial bloodstream infection, risk factors for infection included male sex, obesity, recent surgery, urinary incontinence, and presence on admission of a low prognostic score, gastrotomy tube, or central line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In this study, 81 percent of infections were catheter-related, and methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) was the most common organism, accounting for 23 percent of the infections. The prevalence of MRSA, but not vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, increases with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Further, nosocomial bacteremia increases mortality, length of stay, and cost of care in seniors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498052\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever of unknown origin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a classic medical syndrome defined as temperature &gt;38.3&deg;C (101&deg;F) for at least three weeks and undiagnosed after one week of medical evaluation.

The evaluation of FUO in patients age &gt;60 years should include a rheumatological evaluation including early temporal artery biopsy, particularly if the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or liver enzymes are elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although earlier references [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] suggested malignancy, particularly lymphoma, was a more common cause of FUO in older adults, more recent series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>] suggest malignant disease as a cause of FUO occurs with similar frequency in old and young adults, perhaps due to the ability to establish a diagnosis by more aggressive <span class=\"nowrap\">imaging/computed</span> tomography (CT) scanning before patients reach FUO definitions. In both young and older adults, non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for the majority of cases due to malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of fever of unknown origin in adults&quot;, section on 'Malignancy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare causes of FUO in older individuals include drug fever, deep venous thrombosis with or without pulmonary emboli, and hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498059\"><span class=\"h2\">Infective endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infective endocarditis (IE) is often related to degenerative valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse, or a prosthetic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Older adults have a 4.6-fold higher risk for IE than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Streptococci and staphylococci are recovered from approximately 80 percent of older adults with IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], although enterococcal and Gram-negative organisms occur more commonly than in younger patients, likely explained by a greater incidence of gastrointestinal and genitourinary sources of bacteremia. Although there is some disagreement in different series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/45,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,49,50</a>], it appears that age alone does not influence mortality if one adequately controls for infecting organism and concurrent morbid conditions.</p><p>The diagnosis of IE is often more difficult in older patients. Fever, leukocytosis, embolic events, splenomegaly, skin lesions (Osler nodes, Janeway lesions), and conjunctival hemorrhages are less common with advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Valvular vegetations are also less common, while intracardiac abscesses and paravalvular complications are relatively more common in older than younger adults; these localized infection sites may not be detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Thus, a lower threshold to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be indicated in older patients. However, a negative echocardiogram, either transthoracic or transesophageal, will not exclude the diagnosis of IE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p>Older patients with IE should have therapy directed at the identified pathogen or the most likely causes if blood cultures are negative. For native valve endocarditis, older adults with penicillin-susceptible streptococcal IE should be treated with four weeks of a beta-lactam alone, rather than shorter courses that include combination therapy with an aminoglycoside, to reduce the risk of renal and ototoxicity. When an aminoglycoside is necessary throughout the course of therapy (eg, enterococcal IE), close attention to dose adjustments for renal function and monitoring of serum trough levels is imperative.

The success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in the long-term survival of many patients with HIV, increasing the number of older adults with this disorder.</p><p>Additionally, newly acquired infections are becoming more prevalent among older adults. Older Americans typically acquire HIV infection via sexual activity. Many older individuals did not grow up in an era when sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or methods of preventing STDs, were often discussed. Further, as concerns over pregnancy decline with age, use of barrier methods of contraception wane as well. Thus, this group is the least likely of all United States adults to practice safe sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. In a survey of sexual behavior among United States adults age 55 years and older, 87 percent reported not using condoms during their last intercourse and 15 percent engaged in high-risk behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A study of sexuality of older adults found that 39 to 67 percent of 65- to 74-year-olds were sexually active, while activity in those &gt;75 ranged from 16.7 to 38.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>A lack of HIV awareness, affecting both patients and their clinicians, confounds appropriate diagnosis. Nonspecific symptoms such as poor appetite and weight loss and specific infections such as zoster, tuberculosis, or frequent pneumonias are often mistaken for symptoms related to aging or comorbidity and do not prompt HIV testing as they would in younger adults. Special consideration should be given to HIV as a potentially treatable cause of dementia in those with memory loss. However, no literature has compared the relative likelihood of identifying and reversing dementia due to HIV infection compared with other reversible causes of dementia (eg, thyroid disease, vitamin deficiency, or syphilis).</p><p>HIV infection in older adults tends to present at more advanced stages than in younger individuals, likely due both to delayed diagnosis and impaired immune response. Untreated, HIV pursues a more rapidly progressive course in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Additionally, HIV is impacted by comorbidities that are more common in older adults, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. Including measures of multimorbidity has been shown to be a more accurate predictor of prognosis in HIV-infected patients versus only traditional HIV-related factors (eg, CD4 count, viral load) in the current era of effective ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Further, frailty, a syndrome of high vulnerability to disease and disability usually seen in much older adults, is more frequent at young ages in HIV-infected persons and predicts mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Though early data suggested frailty and multimorbidity were associated with HIV wasting, more recent data suggest that, like the general population, obesity is the major risk factor for frailty and multimorbid disease in those with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Classic geriatric syndromes such as falls also appear to be prevalent at younger ages in those with HIV, and the risk is not predicted by HIV-specific variables but by risk factors similar to those seen in older adults in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Thus, it is recommended that regardless of age, ART for HIV be provided for older adults in accord with current general guidelines. The choice of ART should take into consideration the patient's comorbidities and possible drug-drug interactions.

Prediction rules are intended to supplement rather than override the judgment of the clinicians and factors not included in the predictors may be important in determining management for individual patients. These may include living conditions, underlying psychiatric issues, and overall condition of the patient when determining management.</p><p>Comorbidity was the strongest independent predictor of mortality in older patients with CAP (odds ratio [OR] 4.1, 95% CI 21.-8.1) in one study, where comorbidity was defined as cancer, collagen vascular disease or advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Other independent risk factors include the presence of marked vital sign abnormalities on admission (temperature &lt;36.1&deg;C, blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg systolic, or pulse &gt;110 bpm; OR 3.4, 2.1-5.4), serum creatinine &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (OR 2.5, 1.5-4.2), debility (OR 2.3, 1.4-3.7), and age &gt;85 years (OR 1.8, 1.1-3.1). Mortality nearly doubles, comparing patients age 65 to 69 (7.8 percent) with those older than 90 years (15.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, the overall 30-day mortality rate for Medicare patients &gt;65 years with CAP has declined by 28 percent between 1999 and 2005, likely attributable to increased rates of vaccination against pneumococcus and influenza, and guideline-directed treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>The microbiology of pneumonia in older adults differs from that of young adults. <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is still the predominant organism, but polymicrobial infection and Gram-negative organisms (<em>Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella</em> spp) occur more commonly, particularly in patients with COPD or who reside in long-term care facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and respiratory viruses are also frequent causes of CAP in nursing home residents. Tuberculosis is more common in older adults since they are more likely to have been exposed to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Trends in the microbiology of pneumonia in older adults include identification of a newly discovered agent, human metapneumovirus, which should be suspected when significant wheezing or bronchospasm is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Finally, Chlamydophila<em> pneumonia</em>e accounts for up to 10 percent of CAP in older adults and is most commonly a cause of CAP in adults age 65 to 79 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. A causative organism is not identified in approximately 60 percent of older adults with pneumonia. Older adults may have more difficulty producing good-quality expectorated sputum, and sputum induction may be underutilized as a tool to help in the determination of the microbiology of pulmonary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Immunization for influenza and pneumococcus are the most important preventive strategies. While pneumococcal vaccination may not prevent pneumonia in older adults, rates of bacteremia and invasive pneumococcal disease are decreased in immunized patients, and mortality in older patients hospitalized with pneumonia is lower for patients who were vaccinated prior to admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].

In a trial comparing feeding thin liquids in the chin-down position with two consistencies of thickened feedings (nectar-thickened or honey-thickened) in patients with dementia or Parkinson disease, aspiration as seen by videofluorography was decreased in the groups receiving thickened feedings, but there was no difference in the incidence of aspiration pneumonitis at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorhexidine</a> oral rinses used twice daily did not reduce pneumonia in a study of long-term nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Furthermore, many conditions associated with infected prostheses are accompanied by marked scarring and poor blood flow to the area. Thus, it is preferable to use bactericidal antibiotics in high doses, often combined with a second agent that penetrates biofilms and poorly perfused areas in high concentration and is active against organisms in the stationary phase (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> for staphylococci); addition of rifampin has been associated with improved outcomes in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>], but the issues of drug-drug interactions mentioned above are important with use of rifampin.</p><p>Two-stage procedures with device removal, prolonged antibiotic administration, and subsequent reimplantation of the device is usually considered the gold standard of therapy.</p><p>However, comorbidities and baseline impaired functional status may alter the risks and benefits of two-stage procedures.

In others, return to full functional status is not a realistic goal, and thus additional surgeries to save function are not indicated.</p><p>In those older adults in whom full functionality is the goal, the best chance for cure has been presumed to be a two-stage procedure with removal of the device. However, long periods of debility and being bed-bound are more likely to result in loss of functional status and perhaps independence in older adults, and these outcomes are rarely considered in most trials that evaluate cure rates or survival as the primary endpoint of interest. Functional assessment should be the focus of subsequent clinical trials in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Often recommended vaccines include typhoid, rabies, hepatitis A and B, Japanese encephalitis, and meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines. A review of travel-related immunization recommendations in older adults suggests that although there may be reduced efficacy for some protein and polysaccharide vaccines, their administration is generally well-tolerated. However, live-attenuated organism vaccines may be harmful in some older individuals and should only be given when the risk is high and there is no alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].

Side effects are common for many agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a> may produce dizziness, change in mental status, and bradycardia or prolonged QT intervals). There are many alternative regimens for malaria prophylaxis, but familiarity with current resistance patterns is essential and should guide one&rsquo;s choice for chemoprophylaxis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antibiotics, typically fluoroquinolones, are indicated when diarrhea is accompanied by fever and bloody stools or does not promptly respond to fluid and electrolyte replacement (one to two days). Antimotility agents are generally considered safe when coadministered with antimicrobial therapy, but older adults prone to constipation should be cautious in the use of antimotility drugs.

(See <a href=\"#H1498008\" class=\"local\">'Factors contributing to increased risk for infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical signs or symptoms of infection may be absent in older adults, even in the presence of severe infection. Older adults often have lower baseline body temperature, and febrile response to infection is blunted. Nonspecific decline in baseline function status (increased confusion, falling, anorexia) may signal infection, but other causes of decline in function should be investigated before prescribing antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H1498024\" class=\"local\">'Presentation of disease and prognostic indicators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic dosing should take into account reduced renal function with aging. However, it is important that older adults with serious infection receive a first antibiotic dose at the highest level with known safety profile. Institutionalized older adults are at increased risk for antibiotic resistance, particularly those with indwelling devices (bladder or vascular catheters, gastrostomy tubes, etc). (See <a href=\"#H1498031\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal and genitourinary sources of bacteremia are more common in older adults, leading to increased prevalence of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria. Mortality is increased with bacteremia in older adults versus young adults. (See <a href=\"#H1498045\" class=\"local\">'Bacteremia and sepsis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About one-third of older patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) have treatable infections (eg, intra-abdominal abscess, bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, perinephric abscess, or occult osteomyelitis). Giant cell (temporal) arteritis should be considered early in the differential diagnosis, as nearly one in five adults over age 60 with FUO is eventually diagnosed with this condition. (See <a href=\"#H1498052\" class=\"local\">'Fever of unknown origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adults are at increased risk for infective endocarditis (IE), with most infections due to streptococci or staphylococci. Valvular vegetations may be more difficult to detect with transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) than in younger individual but transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has similar sensitivity. Shortened antibiotic courses for IE that combine a beta lactam and aminoglycoside are not advised due to increased risk for aminoglycoside toxicity in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H1498059\" class=\"local\">'Infective endocarditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adults are at increasing risk for HIV due to failure to use preventive measures. HIV infection in older adults presents at more advanced stages and is more rapidly progressive than in younger individuals. Combination therapy for HIV should be provided for older adults in accord with current guidelines. (See <a href=\"#H1498066\" class=\"local\">'HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia incidence is greatly increased in older adults. <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is the predominant organism, but polymicrobial and Gram-negative infections occur more commonly. Tuberculosis is also more common, and methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) should be considered for patients who reside in long-term care facilities. (See <a href=\"#H1498073\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections related to prosthetic devices are more common in older patients. Although two-stage procedures, involving removal of the prosthetic device and antibiotic treatment, followed by reimplantation, are indicated for curative treatment for most younger patients, selected older patients may be best treated by debridement and ongoing antibiotic suppression to maximize functional benefit and avoid prolonged debility. (See <a href=\"#H1498080\" class=\"local\">'Prosthetic device infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common and should not lead to antibiotic treatment. Guidelines for initiating antibiotics in nursing home residents with possible urinary tract infection (UTI) are presented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61419\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61419 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1498087\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunizations should be maintained for tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcus, and influenza. Zoster vaccine should be administered once to immunocompetent individuals age 60 or older, including patients who have a history of herpes zoster infection. (See <a href=\"#H1498102\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adults are at significant risk for adverse effects to yellow fever vaccination, a live vaccine, which should be reserved for those with exceptionally high risk of exposure. Adverse effects to antimalarial agents are also more common in older adults. Antimotility drugs for management of diarrhea should be used cautiously in patients with a history of constipation.
