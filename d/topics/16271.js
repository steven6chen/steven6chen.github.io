They are the most severe, pervasive, and chronic form of learning difficulty in children with average or above-average intellectual abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>LDs have a multifactorial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. They typically manifest as a failure to acquire reading, writing, or math skills at grade- and age-expected levels. Learning problems that are outside of these traditional core domains, such as memory problems, attention problems, and difficulty managing social interactions, are not typically considered to be LDs. However, they can also be important contributors to academic failure and may require intervention.</p><p>The clinical features of LDs will be presented here. The evaluation, management, and prognosis of LDs and the role of the primary care provider are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-educational-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Role of the primary care provider&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Educational definitions for LD and a review of special education law, which describes how students can access special education services in school settings, also are provided separately.

Intellectual disability is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Management, outcomes, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The core feature of specific learning disabilities (LDs) is an intrinsic cognitive difficulty that results in academic achievement at a level less than expected for the individual's intellectual potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Several definitions of LD agree with this core concept (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53010 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Despite conceptual agreement, the current definitions of LD are not specific enough for consistent case definition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitions of specific learning disability and laws pertaining to learning disabilities in the United States&quot;, section on 'Educational definitions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Learning disabilities (LDs) are twice as common in children with chronic health conditions as in children without chronic health conditions. Children who receive special education services have greater rates of health care utilization than children who do not receive special education services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These correlations persist into adolescence and adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As such, pediatricians are especially likely to encounter children with LD. However, they may not recognize those children unless they ask about learning problems specifically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of LD is difficult to determine because different criteria are used to define LD in different settings. Data from the National Survey of Children's Health indicate that the lifetime prevalence of LD in children in the United States is 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Data from the United States Department of Education indicate that, in 2013-2014, 13 percent of the student population was served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and that 35 percent of those students were categorized as having a specific learning disability. The LD category therefore accounts for 4.5 percent of the total student population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Disorders of reading and written expression are the most common forms of LD. In a population-based study, the prevalence of reading disability among school-age children was estimated to be between 5 and 12 percent, depending upon the criteria used for definition (intelligence-achievement discrepancy versus low achievement, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the same population, the prevalence of disorders of written expression was estimated to be between 7 and 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In separate studies, the prevalence of dyscalculia (math disability) was estimated to be between 3 and 6 percent of the school-age population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of LD is increased among children:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With family history of LD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Who live in poverty and understimulating environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Who were born prematurely.

LDs may be present at birth or acquired after birth as a result of illness, exposure to toxins, poor nutrition, medical treatment, sociocultural deprivation, or injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>LDs are not caused by eye problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Although the eyes are essential to the receipt of visual input, it is the brain that processes visual stimuli and interprets visual images (eg, reverses letters, words, or numbers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Neither LDs nor the processing of visual input is affected by the correction of subtle visual defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of LDs is not known. Genetic and neuropathologic causes may be at the core of LD, particularly in the case of reading disability. However, the full expression of LD occurs as a result of these neuropathologic differences in conjunction with other intrinsic and environmental factors that affect learning. Other intrinsic factors include brain functions, such as language skills, executive functions, and social cognition. Environmental factors include school factors (eg, student-teacher interactions; appropriately paced instruction; the student's past exposure to learning opportunities at school; level of stimulation provided by the learning materials; physical layout of the classroom setting) and home factors, such as past exposure to learning at home, degree of support provided in the home for reading and homework completion, etc. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. For a review of these factors and their association with socioeconomic status, see reference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Neuropathologic causes for learning failure can be mitigated with appropriate instruction and a supportive learning environment and can be aggravated when the learning environment is not supportive.

Dyslexia is a specific type of reading disorder caused by deficits in phonologic processing. The phonologic deficits are unexpected in relation to the student's overall intelligence and persist even after receiving appropriate (general education) instruction.</p><p>Reading disability presents initially with problems in letter-sound relationships (ie, in decoding words and reading fluency in kindergarten or grade one). Problems with reading comprehension usually present in the latter part of the primary school years, when the focus is on reading to learn rather than learning to read. Children with reading disability may have attention problems and may avoid reading. They can be identified by low overall reading achievement or by low reading ability in relation to their overall intelligence.</p><p>Reading disability is discussed in detail separately.

In addition to these two basic components, students with math LD can have difficulty with the language of math (correctly reading and understanding numbers and symbols), word problems in math (correctly reading and understanding the text of word problems), and with the visual-spatial and organizational demands of math [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Success in math is thus dependent on a broad range of neurodevelopmental functions, summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Number sense</strong> &ndash; Number sense refers to having a mental representation of quantity.

Common one- and two-digit math facts are usually memorized and then retrieved automatically from memory in later grades and in solving higher-order math problems. Difficulty calculating math facts can be related to problems with number sense. The student with poor math fact skills may not know how to complete math calculations and may overrely on tangible aids, such as pictures or tables. Difficulty with the automatic retrieval of math facts is another manifestation of math disability and can also create difficulty in solving higher-order math problems.

Students with math LD may have difficulty organizing math problems on the page. They may copy numbers incorrectly, write numbers illegibly, misalign numbers, have left-right disorientation of numbers, misplace digits in multidigit numbers, skip rows or columns during calculations, fail to carry numbers (eg, regrouping when appropriate), reverse number problems, start a calculation in the wrong place, or not recognize operator signs.

A language-based LD usually affects reading comprehension and written expression. Children with language-based learning problems also will struggle with word problems in math. Language-based LD may or may not include phonologic weaknesses: problems with reading decoding and spelling (encoding). Children with language-based LDs have relative strengths in the ability to perceive visual information accurately, solve problems using visual information, and learn and socialize effectively using visual cues. They have difficulty understanding and using one or several of the components of language, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phonology (discriminating the sounds in words)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Content (vocabulary)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Form (grammar, syntax [word order], and morphemes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pragmatics (narrative, discourse, and conversations)</p><p/><p>Children with language-based LD have difficulty understanding and sharing information in a variety of contexts, spoken or written.

Classrooms that are organized and instruction that is systematic and predictable can help to mitigate the degree to which intrinsic learning weaknesses affect the child's learning. Teachers who are skilled at determining a student's capacity to understand, remember, and follow oral instructions and who can adjust the language load by simplifying instructions, providing repetition, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> providing visual supports can reduce the impact of language delays on the child's learning and thereby improve the child's overall performance when he or she is expected to learn to read or count. Teachers who understand the impact of executive dysfunctions, which occur in children with attention deficit hyperactivity and other disorders, can mitigate the impact of executive dysfunctions by providing extra monitoring, supervision, and organizational supports. All of these classroom strategies help to reduce the effort that the student has to make when addressing learning tasks related to his or her areas of weakness, regardless of LD type. However, the consistency with which such teaching strategies are practiced is highly variable.

These factors are not always considered to be a specific focus of educational intervention, but when they are addressed successfully, they help prepare the student to learn in the classroom. Language and executive dysfunction are particularly important areas to target for any student with an LD, regardless of the LD type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features/abstract/33,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric health care providers should consider the possibility of LD in children who have risk factors and children who have problems at school (whether the problems are related to academic achievement, behavior, attention, or social interaction).

Among older children, reading disability tends to persist over time. Even though reading skills may improve, phonologic processing skills continue to measure below normal.
