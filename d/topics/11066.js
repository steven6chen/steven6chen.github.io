The utilization of the metyrapone test has become less frequent as a result of the larger availability of plasma ACTH assays. The limited accessibility to metyrapone in certain countries as well as the limited number of clinical laboratories who have maintained the urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid (17-OHCS) and serum 11-deoxycortisol tests have also further limited the use of the metyrapone tests. The insulin tolerance test is the gold standard to evaluate the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, but it requires close surveillance with inherent risks of severe hypoglycemia; it also has specific contraindications in patients with epilepsy and coronary disease and high costs, so other alternative tests have been developed. The metyrapone test is considered to be a sensitive alternative test to evaluate the ACTH reserve, and it is a useful clinical test to evaluate the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in various pathologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metyrapone</a> stimulation test protocols and interpretation will be reviewed here. Other tests to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are discussed separately.

Thus, in healthy individuals, the fall in serum cortisol concentrations leads sequentially to decreased negative feedback at hypothalamic and pituitary levels, which increases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH secretion and adrenal steroidogenesis; the resultant secretion of cortisol precursors, in particular, 11-deoxycortisol (the substrate of CYP11B1), can be measured by radioimmunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), or fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry <span class=\"nowrap\">(LC-MS/MS)</span> in blood or its metabolites in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The increase in serum 11-deoxycortisol concentrations provides an index of the increase in ACTH release; a failure of these values to rise can indicate either ACTH deficiency or primary adrenal disease. Thus, if the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test is abnormal, the ability of the adrenal gland to respond to exogenous ACTH must be assessed to distinguish between these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the response to ACTH in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the detection of ACTH deficiency, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> stimulation test can also be used in the evaluation of patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.

It cannot be performed in a patient who is taking any glucocorticoid. Metyrapone is currently available in North America through its distributor HRA Pharma (Paris, France) via its specialty pharmacy Direct Success Inc with order forms available on the web (<a href=\"http://www.metopirone.us/&amp;token=nCQuvLQEjhvgBxjVzcYAXvCRHkjsCNZvs0O2KQIAewf0YaSL/rw0eeBZJqHn5DDe&amp;TOPIC_ID=162\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.metopirone.us</a>) or by phone at 1-855-674-7663; order forms can be faxed to 1-855-674-6767.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial versions of the test involved taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> orally every four hours for 24 hours, with measurement of serum 11-deoxycortisol and its urinary metabolites as 17-OHCS over two or three days.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Drug side effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Overnight single-dose metyrapone test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single-dose test is performed by oral administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight, or 2 grams for &lt;70 kg, 2.5 grams for 70 to 90 kg, and 3 grams for &gt;90 kg body weight) at midnight with a glass of milk or a small snack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Serum 11-deoxycortisol and cortisol are measured between 7:30 and 9:30 AM the next morning; plasma corticotropin (ACTH) can also be measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/1,6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-13</a>]. In another study, the following dosing was utilized: 50 kg = 1.5 g; 51 to 58 kg = 1.75 g; 59 to 67 kg = 2.0 g; 68 to 75 kg = 2.25 g; 76 to 83 kg = 2.5 g; 84 to 92 kg = 2.75 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A normal response to the overnight, single-dose test consists of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An 8 AM serum 11-deoxycortisol concentration of 7 to 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (200 to 660 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/1,3,5,6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,6,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum cortisol concentration at 8 AM of less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (138 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> confirms adequate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> blockade and thereby documents compliance and normal metabolism of metyrapone.</p><p/><p>Serum 11-deoxycortisol concentrations less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (210 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> with concomitantly suppressed cortisol values indicate adrenal insufficiency. However, in one study, the sum of 11-deoxycortisol and of cortisol &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (450 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> following single-dose, overnight <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> yielded better diagnostic accuracy than using 11-deoxycortisol levels alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a study of 31 patients with various hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis abnormalities, comparing insulin tolerance test with overnight metyrapone test, a cut-off of 144 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> for 11-deoxycortisol yielded the highest sensitivity of 82.4 percent to detect patients responding normally to insulin tolerance test, but only 64.3 percent of those with subnormal response to insulin tolerance test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The ACTH response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> can distinguish between primary and secondary insufficiency. In general, patients with partial secondary adrenal insufficiency have ACTH responses from 10 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (2 to 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> while patients with primary adrenal insufficiency have higher responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/1,2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9</a>]. However, healthy individuals have an ACTH response of 42 to 690 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (9 to 210 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because of this overlap, the ACTH response alone cannot be used to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with adrenal insufficiency.</p><p>The single-dose test appears to be safe for outpatient use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/1-3,6,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6,17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG SIDE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By reducing cortisol production, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> can result in hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort or cramping, and muscle and joint pain in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Metyrapone can also cause dizziness, sedation, allergic rash, or, rarely, decreased white blood cell count or bone marrow suppression. In one study using the overnight metyrapone test, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 10 mg was administered once samples were collected, before discharging the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test is a very sensitive test of pituitary corticotropin (ACTH) secretory reserve found to be more sensitive than insulin tolerance test in certain studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] or slightly less in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It depends upon the release of pituitary ACTH secretion from negative feedback inhibition by cortisol; hypocortisolemia is a much less powerful stimulus to ACTH release than hypoglycemia or other stresses. Thus, a patient with partial hypopituitarism may maintain normal daily ACTH and cortisol secretion and respond to insulin-induced hypoglycemia with a normal increase in ACTH and cortisol secretion, yet be unable to increase ACTH secretion normally when cortisol biosynthesis is blocked by metyrapone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69011 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Conversely, a patient who responds normally to metyrapone almost always responds normally to hypoglycemia or other stresses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When used to diagnose hypoadrenalism, a normal response to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> tests indicates an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; such a patient does not have any form of adrenal insufficiency and requires no further investigation. An abnormal test could reflect either primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Distinction between the two can be determined by finding a high basal or stimulated plasma ACTH concentration, which would indicate primary adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/1,2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9</a>].</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test is the most sensitive method to detect partial defects in pituitary ACTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/1-3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,19</a>]. Thus, morning basal plasma ACTH and serum cortisol concentrations, basal urinary excretion of cortisol, the responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and both the 1 and 250 mcg ACTH stimulation tests may all be normal, but the metyrapone test may be subnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>]. An example would be a patient with a suspected pituitary mass who has no clinical manifestations of ACTH deficiency, an intermediate 8 AM serum cortisol concentration, but an abnormal metyrapone test. If the metyrapone test is abnormal, the ability of the adrenal gland to respond to exogenous ACTH must always be demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the response to ACTH in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rise in serum 11-deoxycortisol concentrations may be exaggerated in women taking an oral contraceptive and patients with hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, obesity, and chronic renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">False positives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are, however, settings in which false-positive results can be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unappreciated recent exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids by any route can result in a subnormal response as a result of suppression of the corticotropes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the more common causes of a false-positive result is unusually rapid clearance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> from the plasma, resulting in inadequate blockade of cortisol biosynthesis. This is manifested by a serum cortisol concentration greater than 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (210 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in the sample drawn at 8 AM in the overnight test. Cortisol levels measured by conventional immunoassays can be falsely elevated by the interference of increased 11-deoxycortisol levels induced by metyrapone; the wider availability of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry <span class=\"nowrap\">(LC-MS/MS)</span> steroid assays should facilitate better interpretation of the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Rapid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> clearance occurs in approximately 4 percent of normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. Metyrapone is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes that are induced by many of the same drugs that increase steroid metabolism (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the cause of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a report of 196 patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, 15 of whom had surgically-confirmed ectopic ACTH secretion, a positive response, suggestive of Cushing's disease, consisted of a fourfold increase in serum 11-deoxycortisol concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The sensitivity was of 88 percent in patients who satisfied criteria for both the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression test.</p><p>The rate of steroid production after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> may be very high in patients with Cushing's disease because it starts from a much higher baseline than normal. The reason for the increase after metyrapone is that the microadenoma responds to hypocortisolemia with a greater than normal increase in ACTH secretion and the hyperplastic adrenal cortex is able to respond with still greater steroid production.</p><p>In general, the response in the patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome depends upon the duration and severity of hypercortisolism. Patients with longstanding ectopic ACTH secretion do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> (or to increased serum glucocorticoid concentrations resulting from the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression test), presumably because their hypothalamic-pituitary axis is chronically and profoundly suppressed.</p><p>The response may be different when the hypercortisolemia is of relatively short duration because hypothalamic-pituitary suppression may be incomplete. Thus, although the tumors do not respond to hypocortisolemia with increased ACTH secretion, the normal pituitary is able to secrete some ACTH, and the hyperplastic adrenals are able to respond to even a small increment in plasma ACTH with increased cortisol secretion. These patients tend to have a less-than-normal response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a>. However, some patients with bronchial carcinoid tumors may respond to metyrapone in the setting of chronic hypercortisolism, suggesting that hypocortisolism can modulate tumoral secretion of ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Response in cortisol-producing adrenal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with adrenal tumors and, presumably, other forms of primary adrenal hypersecretion, rarely have high levels of 11-deoxycortisol when given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a>, for a number of reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metyrapone-stimulation-tests/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chronic hypercortisolemia has suppressed hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary ACTH synthesis and secretion.
