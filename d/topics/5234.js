In modern usage, the term carcinoid is still used to refer to well-differentiated NETs arising in the lung (typical or atypical carcinoids), but within the gastrointestinal tract, the term carcinoid has fallen out of favor, and the World Health Organization preference is for the term NET. Regardless of site, the term &quot;neuroendocrine carcinoma&quot; is usually assigned to high-grade or poorly differentiated NETs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H440387068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Pathology, tumor classification, and nomenclature'</a>.) </p><p>NETs can present in several different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a result of the carcinoid syndrome: Chronic flushing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea are the typical manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome, which is the result of secretion of serotonin and other vasoactive substances into the systemic circulation. The carcinoid syndrome is primarily associated with metastatic tumors originating in the midgut (distal small intestine and proximal colon). In contrast, hindgut (distal colorectal) and foregut (gastroduodenal, lung) NETs uncommonly produce the carcinoid syndrome.

This test has a sensitivity of over 90 percent and specificity of 90 percent for the carcinoid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sensitivity is low in patients with carcinoid tumors without the carcinoid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>False positive results may be induced by the ingestion of certain drugs and <span class=\"nowrap\">tryptophan/serotonin-rich</span> foods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79968\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79968 \">table 2</a>). These foods should be avoided for three days prior to urine collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Measurement of urinary excretion of 5-HIAA is generally most useful in patients with primary midgut (jejunoileal, appendiceal, ascending colon) carcinoid tumors, which produce the highest levels of serotonin. Foregut (gastroduodenal, bronchus) and hindgut (transverse, descending and sigmoid colon, rectum, genitourinary) carcinoid tumors only rarely secrete serotonin; they lack the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase and cannot convert 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) to serotonin, and therefore, to 5-HIAA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51368 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; these tumors may produce 5-HT (and histamine) instead of serotonin. However, there is no commercially available assay for urinary 5-HT.</p><p>The normal rate of 5-HIAA excretion ranges from 2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (10 to 42 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span>. Values of up to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (157 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span> may be found in patients with malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac and Whipple's disease, as well as after the ingestion of large amounts of tryptophan- or serotonin-rich foods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79968\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79968 \">table 2</a>). Although many patients with the carcinoid syndrome have similar modest elevations, some have values for urinary 5-HIAA excretion above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (523 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span>. In one study, for example, urinary 5-HIAA excretion in patients with the carcinoid syndrome ranged from 99 to 2070 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (518 to 10,826 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients should probably avoid intake of tryptophan- and serotonin-rich foods as well as medicines that may cause a false positive urinary 5-HIAA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79968\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79968 \">table 2</a>) at least 24 hours before and during the 24-hour urine collection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4390319\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary excretion of serotonin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of urinary 5-HIAA excretion is generally not useful in foregut (gastroduodenal, bronchial) carcinoids, which often lack aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56015 \">table 3</a>). Very rarely, these patients can present with an atypical hormonal syndrome associated with secretion of 5-HT; however, assays for this metabolite are not available in clinical laboratories in the United States.</p><p>Measurement of urinary serotonin may be of value in the rare patient with a foregut carcinoid in whom carcinoid syndrome is suspected since DOPA decarboxylase in the renal parenchyma may convert the 5-HT to serotonin, leading to high levels of urinary serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chromogranin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromogranins (designated as A, B, and C) are proteins that are stored and released with peptides and amines in a variety of neuroendocrine tissues. Well-differentiated NETs, including carcinoids, are associated with elevated blood concentrations of chromogranins, which increase with larger tumor burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-8</a>]. Chromogranins B and C are less sensitive indicators of NETs as compared with chromogranin A (CgA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Levels of CgA secretion vary on a day-by-day basis in healthy subjects and those with NETs. Food intake also increases CgA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In general, CgA is a nonspecific marker for NETs such as carcinoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of CgA for the diagnosis of NETs depends on the cutoff value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. This was illustrated in a series that compared plasma CgA levels in 238 patients with well-differentiated NETs, 42 with chronic atrophic gastritis, and 48 healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Using the DAKO enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, the best cutoff range between participants without neoplasia and those with NETs was 31 to 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> (sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 84 percent, respectively). When specificity was set at 95 percent, with a cutoff of 84 to 87 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L,</span> sensitivity was only 55 percent. This assay, which measures CgA concentration in <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L,</span> is not usually used in the United States; there is a lack of international standardization that makes it difficult to extrapolate these values to other CgA assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. False positive elevations of CgA can be present in a number of other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73287\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73287 \">table 4</a>). They are especially common in patients who are taking a proton pump inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>Due to its relatively low specificity, we do not recommend the use of CgA as a screening test for diagnosis of a carcinoid tumor or the carcinoid syndrome. CgA is an appropriate tumor marker for patients with an established diagnosis in order to assess disease progression, response to therapy, or recurrence after surgical resection.

However, the sensitivities and specificities of these assays have not been well established. In one report, the mean fasting blood serotonin concentration in normal subjects ranged from 71 to 310 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (0.4 to 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Ten patients with the carcinoid syndrome had markedly elevated values, from 790 to 4500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (4.5 to 25.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L);</span> of these, two had normal urinary 5-HIAA excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, false positive serotonin tests may occur due to release of platelet serotonin as well as by ingestion of <span class=\"nowrap\">tryptophan/serotonin-rich</span> foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Consequently, we do not recommend measurement of blood serotonin levels as a standard diagnostic test for the carcinoid syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1511485927\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma 5-HIAA concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A relatively novel test of plasma 5-HIAA has been developed that offers improved convenience compared with 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA measurement. In one study of 115 NET patients, levels of fasting plasma 5-HIAA correlated very closely with levels of urine 5-HIAA (p&lt;0.0001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Vasoactive peptides that are produced by localized intestinal carcinoid tumors are inactivated in the portal circulation and, thus, do not result in the carcinoid syndrome. Imaging studies should, therefore, focus on the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and diagnostic imaging using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs (Indium-111 pentetreotide [111-In pentetreotide, OctreoScan], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> [68-Ga DOTATATE]) are the primary imaging modalities used to identify carcinoid tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31868282\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT scans are noninvasive and readily available. Multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT is recommended for evaluation of all patients with carcinoid tumors, with the exception of tumors with very low probability of spread, such as most type 1 and 2 gastric carcinoid tumors, or small (&lt;1 to 2 cm) superficial (T1) rectal carcinoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Hypervascular metastases may appear isodense with the liver on a noncontrasted study. Following the injection of intravenous (IV) contrast, most carcinoids enhance with iodinated contrast during the early arterial phase (approximately 20 seconds after contrast injection), with washout during the portal venous imaging phase (approximately 70 seconds after contrast injection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Arterial phase imaging can aid in detection these early-enhancing lesions. Small intestinal carcinoids often produce mesenteric masses with dense desmoplastic fibrosis, either due to direct extension of primary tumors into the mesentery or due to mesenteric lymph node metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78186 \">image 2</a>). The classic finding on CT is a mass-like process with soft tissue &quot;spokes&quot; radiating into the mesenteric fat toward the small bowel, often causing retraction of the bowel with angulation and tethering. The central mass may or may not be calcified. The differential diagnosis includes sclerosing mesenteritis.

As a result of this greater sensitivity for liver metastases, some physicians prefer MRI over CT for assessing the status of the liver in patients with carcinoid tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In a study of 37 patients with liver metastases from gastroenteropancreatic NETs, the most sensitive sequences for detection of liver metastases were hepatic arterial phase and fast spin-echo T2-weighed images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31868296\"><span class=\"h2\">Indium-111 pentetreotide (OctreoScan)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many carcinoid tumors express high levels of somatostatin receptors and can therefore be imaged with a radiolabeled form of the somatostatin analog <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (111-In pentetreotide, OctreoScan). This technique has the advantage of instantaneous whole body scanning, which also allows detection of metastases outside of the abdominal region.

The accuracy of 111-In pentetreotide has improved with the addition of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to planar imaging since SPECT permits more accurate differentiation between areas of pathologic and physiologic uptake in the abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81388\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81388 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72923 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62072\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62072 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The clinical value of 111-In pentetreotide in the routine evaluation and follow-up of patients with carcinoid tumors and the carcinoid syndrome has been called into question because of improvements in the sensitivity of cross-sectional imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>] and the development of positron-emitting radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, such as 68-Ga DOTATATE, that when used in conjunction with positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, are more sensitive than 111-In pentetreotide.

However, other diagnoses must be considered. The differential diagnosis of flushing, for example, includes physiologic events, drugs, and a number of diseases other than the carcinoid syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78237\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78237 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a>). Moreover, other neuroendocrine tumor types can cause severe chronic diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H4390107\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most useful initial diagnostic test for the carcinoid syndrome is to measure 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is the end product of serotonin metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51368 \">figure 1</a>). Depending on the cutoff value used, this test has a high sensitivity and high specificity for carcinoid syndrome but requires strict avoidance of foods containing serotonin and tryptophan as well as certain drugs for three days prior to the urine collection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79968\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79968 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Urinary excretion of 5-HIAA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Measurement of urinary 5-HIAA excretion is generally not useful in foregut (gastroduodenal, lung) neuroendocrine tumors, which often lack aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. In this setting, we would pursue imaging studies to search for a carcinoid tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Due to its relatively low specificity, we do not recommend the use of serum chromogranin A (CgA) as a screening test for diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chromogranin concentration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the biochemical diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome is confirmed, usually by an elevated 24-hour excretion of 5-HIAA, the tumor must be localized. Two techniques, standard cross-sectional imaging and diagnostic imaging with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, have a complementary role in tumor localization. For diagnostic workup of carcinoid syndrome, we generally perform helical, contrast-enhanced, triple-phase computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis (see <a href=\"#H31868282\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis is an acceptable alternative and is preferred by some physicians because of its greater sensitivity for liver metastases. (See <a href=\"#H31868289\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Uptake of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs can assist in identifying an otherwise occult primary site. Where available, functional imaging with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is preferred over 111-Indium pentetreotide (OctreoScan) due to its greater sensitivity.
