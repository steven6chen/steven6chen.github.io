However, a low GFR is not necessarily associated with a parallel reduction in urine output, which can vary from oliguria (&lt;400 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> to normal values (eg, 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Although oliguria is common in patients with AKI, anuria (urine output &lt;50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> is rare. Anuria is most often seen in two conditions: shock and complete bilateral urinary tract obstruction. Other, less common causes are the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, renal cortical necrosis, bilateral renal arterial obstruction, and rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis, particularly antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF URINE OUTPUT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The difference in urine output between oliguric and nonoliguric AKI may be due to one of two factors: Nonoliguric patients may have a higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than those with oliguria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> they may reabsorb less in the tubules. If, for example, the GFR falls to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> (equal to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> the urine output will be relatively normal at 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> if only 5 to 6 L are reabsorbed.</p><p>Declines in urine output may not only be a result of AKI, but also predict its development. This was suggested in a retrospective analysis of 390 critically ill patients with septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Oliguria, defined as urine output &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour and observed within the first 12 hours following recognition of septic shock, was positively associated with the development of AKI (defined by a serum creatinine increment according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] stage II criteria), need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.28). In this study, more than five hours of consecutive oliguria predicted subsequent AKI KDIGO stage II or greater with an accuracy of 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Studies in animal models have shown that there is less morphologic and functional damage in nonoliguric compared with oliguric AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is also evidence in humans suggesting that the absence of oliguria in AKI generally reflects less severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/1,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7</a>]. The following observations from different studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report noted a direct correlation between the urine flow rate and the residual GFR in patients with three to six days of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Oliguric patients generally had a GFR (measured by creatinine and inulin clearance) of &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> compared with 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in patients with a urine volume of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other studies, nonoliguric patients had a lower peak serum creatinine concentration (6 versus 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [528 versus 792 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> than oliguric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and a lower incidence of requiring dialysis during the acute phase of the illness (28 versus 84 percent and 46 versus 82 percent in different studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of an electronic database derived from patients admitted to the intensive care unit in one medical center, the relationship of absolute and relative serum creatinine increments and urine output decrements over a continuous spectrum of observation time intervals was evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among 14,526 patients included in the analysis, oliguria &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour was associated with a sharp increase in the risk for mortality or the requirement for RRT. In addition, even higher urine output rates between 0.5 and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour were associated with adverse clinical outcomes if they were observed over a prolonged time interval of 24 to 48 hours. Other studies in critically ill patients have shown similar results; mortality is higher in patients with oliguric AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another, more recent analysis of electronic medical records underscored the prognostic importance of oliguria in addition to serum creatinine-based criteria for AKI in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This analysis included data from 32,045 patients treated at a single center between 2000 and 2008, 74.5 percent of whom developed AKI according to the KDIGO staging criteria. The study showed that, while oliguria criteria alone were associated with only a 2.1 percent need for RRT and a 12.4 percent in-hospital mortality and serum creatinine increment criteria alone with 4.9 and 16.8 percent, respectively, patients who demonstrated a combination of oliguria and serum creatinine increment criteria experienced a need for RRT in 25 percent and in-hospital mortality in 32 percent of cases.</p><p/><p>However, nonoliguric AKI is not necessarily associated with a better prognosis in all settings. In an observational study of patients with AKI who required dialysis, a higher urine volume was independently associated with increased time from admission to start of dialysis and higher in-hospital mortality (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-12.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Delay in initiation of dialysis, prompted by response to diuretic therapy and anticipation of recovery of kidney function, may be a contributing factor to the increase in mortality in patients with nonoliguric AKI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OLIGURIA, POSITIVE FLUID BALANCE, AND INCREASED MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive fluid balance as an independent predictor of increased mortality in patients with AKI has been noted in several prospective, multicenter, observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>] and in a secondary analysis derived from the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT), a prospective, randomized trial of conservative versus liberal fluid administration strategies in patients with acute lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The following findings are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of critically ill patients that included 1120 patients with AKI, oliguric patients had a greater mean positive fluid balance than nonoliguric patients (620 versus 270 mL) and a significantly higher 60-day mortality rate (41 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 618 patients with AKI, fluid overload, defined as a &gt;10 percent increase in body weight at the initiation of dialysis, was associated with a significant increase in death within 60 days of enrollment (46 versus 32 percent; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.3&ndash;3.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of 1453 patients enrolled in the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) RRT trial, the mean daily fluid balance was +560 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> among nonsurvivors compared with -234 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> among survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A negative mean daily fluid balance was independently associated with a significantly lower risk of death at 90 days (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24-0.43).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the FACTT trial, 306 of 1000 patients developed AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among these patients, positive fluid balance was associated with an increased adjusted 60-day mortality (OR 1.6 per <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day,</span> 95% CI 1.3-2.0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A more recent, retrospective analysis from a single center evaluated 15,395 patients who were transferred from an intensive care unit to a regular medical or surgical ward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The adjusted hazard ratio for 90-day mortality was higher in the fourth (median +7.6 liters) compared with the first (-1.5 liters) quartile of fluid balance (adjusted hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.61). These results were driven by patients suffering from congestive heart failure, AKI, or renal impairment.</p><p/><p>Despite these results that may discourage clinicians from administering crystalloids to expand the extracellular fluid volume, the immediate physiologic benefits of volume expansion in patients with circulatory failure should not be overlooked. This was demonstrated in a study of 49 critically ill patients with hypotension, need for vasopressors, oliguria, or reduced central or mixed venous oxygen saturation who were compared with 39 control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Fluid administration resulted in a small but consistent decrease in Doppler sonographically measured resistivity index (RI) in renal interlobar arteries and increases in mean arterial pressure and urine output. The increase in urine output was predicted by changes in RI, but not changes in mean arterial pressure in this analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITED ROLE OF DIURETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main indication for diuretic therapy in patients with AKI is short-term treatment for volume control. However, such use should not postpone the initiation of dialysis, if required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and other reviews concluded that loop diuretics should <strong>not</strong> be used to prevent AKI or as a possible therapy for established AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The KDIGO guidelines also concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> is <strong>not</strong> scientifically justified in an attempt to prevent AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonoliguric-versus-oliguric-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The supportive data are discussed elsewhere.

Diuretics may be given for a short length of time for volume control, but such use should not postpone the initiation of dialysis (if required).
