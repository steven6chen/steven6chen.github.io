Most deceased-donor organs are recovered from donors who meet criteria for brain death and have ongoing cardiac function. Brain death is irreversible, and the ability to recover transplantable organs exists only because the technology of the intensive care unit (ICU) can maintain physiologic homeostasis, including circulation and respiration. Without this support, &quot;brain death&quot; occurs almost simultaneously with &quot;cardiac death.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The issues involved in the pre-recovery medical management of the deceased donor will be discussed here. Issues related to the determination of brain death and the selection and preservation of donated organs are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Donor lung preservation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-donor-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Donor selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICIAN RESPONSIBILITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recovery of viable organs for transplantation is dependent upon appropriate medical management both before and after death is determined, regardless of whether brain criteria or cardiac criteria for death are utilized. Even with intensive care support, the brain-dead donor can be challenging to manage because the pathophysiologic changes induced by brain death upset homeostasis. The medical team managing the potential donor must anticipate and prevent (preferably) or detect and treat abnormalities that can cause circulatory collapse or permanent damage to otherwise transplantable organs.</p><p>Clinicians who care for critically ill or injured patients in the emergency department, intensive care unit (ICU), or operating room must be able to recognize potential organ donors and be aware of the criteria for brain death and organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require that the option of organ donation be discussed only by individuals with specialized training in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Most authors agree that requests by the organ procurement coordinator along with the treating physician represent the most effective approach to organ donation. In addition, efficient coordination among these physicians, organ procurement organizations, and transplant centers to promote the best physiologic donor management is required to maximize the number of viable organs available for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This is particularly important in specialized, high-volume trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the system of deceased-donor organ donation is based upon &quot;explicit consent,&quot; in which the individual is assumed to not be a donor unless the individual indicates their wish of becoming an organ donor upon their death. The decision to donate must be registered by the individual or is expressed by family members at the time of death. By comparison, there is a system of &quot;presumed consent&quot; in many other nations, in which the individual who is against donating an organ must either register their desire or express this desire to a family member. If this has not occurred, it is assumed that the person is an organ donor. Deceased-donor kidney transplantation rates are higher in nations with &quot;presumed consent&quot; compared with those with an &quot;explicit consent&quot; system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, living-donor kidney transplantation rates are lower in nations with presumed consent. The underlying reasons for this difference are unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain death sets in motion a number of pathophysiologic responses including potentially severe inflammatory responses, not all of which are understood, that are harmful to the function of potentially transplantable organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Donor management involves a complex resuscitative effort to overcome these problems and maximize the potential viability of all organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The basic management goals are to achieve hemodynamic stability and optimal function of all organs that may be transplanted.</p><p>This process requires balancing the interventions needed for the successful preservation of multiple organs. Interventions that improve the function of one organ may be detrimental to the function of other organs. As an example, although the renal transplant team prefers an extremely well-hydrated donor with excellent diuresis, overhydration may jeopardize the transplantability of the heart, lungs, liver, and pancreas. Data show that restrictive fluid balance, which is intended to improve lung procurement and viability, has no detrimental effect on rates of kidney procurement or function after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Other important general considerations are the maintenance of proper ventilatory support, good pulmonary toilet, and appropriate infection prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Normothermia should be maintained passively on all brain-dead cadavers using blankets. A temperature less than 35&deg;C requires use of active rewarming modalities, such as a warm air blanket. The administration of N-acetylcysteine prior to angiographic procedures done to confirm brain death does not appear to provide a benefit after kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic hypotension is common in brain-dead deceased donors (up to 80 percent) and may be caused by lack of sympathetic tone, central diabetes insipidus, adrenal insufficiency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deliberate volume restriction prior to the determination of brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hypovolemia related to blood loss may also contribute, particularly in trauma victims. Adequate volume resuscitation is therefore critically important to ensure donor viability and is the first step in correcting low blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In the past, the use of a pulmonary catheter was a mainstay of fluid management, but trends are moving away from that device. Instead, measurement of &quot;fluid responsiveness&quot; using passive leg raising or pulse pressure variation during the respiratory cycle is more commonly used and is a more accurate predictor of the need for fluid resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, since volume resuscitation may not be sufficient to improve blood pressure because of a loss of vascular tone, inotropic or pressor support may be a necessary adjunct. Many clinicians start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, but other agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>, may be required. Using the lowest dose of the least injurious agent is the preferred approach, but this is not always possible. The goal is to achieve a normotensive, euvolemic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For patients who require vasopressor support, a central venous catheter may be useful to help guide therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCRINE DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important endocrine problem in the brain-dead donor is central diabetes insipidus, caused by inadequate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production within the posterior pituitary gland. Hypotonic urine volumes exceeding 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> may be seen and can be devastating if not treated adequately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although volume replacement will help ensure euvolemia, excessive diuresis is more easily managed by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> to keep urine output in the 100 to 200 mL per hour range. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adrenal insufficiency is also common following brain death. As an example, a retrospective study noted low baseline cortisol levels and impaired response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation in 76 percent of patients who met criteria for brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, thyroid abnormalities, including the &quot;sick euthyroid syndrome,&quot; are also prevalent after brain death. Some authors have demonstrated that more transplantable organs may be able to be recovered from deceased donors who have received thyroid supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In an attempt to counteract all of the effects described above, administration of triple therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, and a single dose of either triiodothyronine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> has been advocated to help promote hemodynamic stability in deceased donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/8,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19-22</a>]. While the efficacy of this approach has not been validated, it is used commonly in organ procurement organizations around the country.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal donor management remains important when the donor is taken to the operating room for organ recovery. The same principles described above apply to the intraoperative setting. In the case of a multiple-organ donor, for example, the operative time prior to aortic cross-clamping may be relatively long as both the thoracic and the abdominal organ recovery teams will require time for preliminary dissection of their respective organs. Assuring hemodynamic stability and good diuresis during this period is a key part of successful organ recovery. Immediately prior to aortic cross-clamping, heparin (at a dose of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg)</span> is administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DONATION AFTER DEATH DETERMINED USING CIRCULATORY CRITERIA (DCD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, a situation will occur where a potentially suitable donor is identified who does not meet criteria for brain death, but has no hope of any sort of viable recovery, and in whom life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn. After death is determined using standard cardiopulmonary criteria (permanent absence of respiration, circulation, and responsiveness), organs may be procured for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In this setting, recovery of the kidneys, the liver, the lungs, and the pancreas can be attempted, but only after the ventilator has been disconnected, the heart has stopped beating, and the patient has been determined to be dead using cardiopulmonary criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. This is referred to as donation after cardiac death (DCD).</p><p>This procedure is best performed in the operating room setting to minimize the warm ischemic time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Potential donor patients are generally receiving life-sustaining therapy and would ordinarily be expected to expire within a very short amount of time after discontinuation of life support. Practically speaking, this includes patients on ventilators, intra-aortic balloon pumps, ventricular assist devices, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high-dose vasopressor or inotrope therapy.</p><p>Prior to the loss of circulation, heparin must be administered to decrease the risk of thrombosis. While some centers will use a vasodilator to reduce tissue ischemia, others avoid this class of medications because of the ethical concern regarding hastening death. Usually, only 30 to 45 minutes of warm ischemia can be tolerated. This time can be calculated from the time of onset of hypotension or hypoxemia until the time the organs have been cooled, although some centers advocate calculating the time from when the support is withdrawn until the time the organs are cooled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Despite an increased incidence of poor initial allograft function, some centers have reported long-term survival rates of kidneys from donors after cardiac death comparable with those observed with kidneys recovered from heart-beating and living donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/25,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30-33</a>]. In a single-center study, for example, the one- and five-year renal allograft survival rate was 87 and 82 percent for transplants from non-heart-beating donors, 91 and 86 for transplants from heart-beating donors less than 60 years of age, and 80 and 73 percent for transplants from heart-beating donors greater than 60 years of age, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Perfusing these kidneys with a pulsatile preservation system may help reduce the rate of delayed graft function in DCD kidneys (this is fairly well established with traditional brain-dead donor kidneys). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deceased-and-living-donor-renal-allograft-recovery#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deceased- and living-donor renal allograft recovery&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.)</p><p>Limited experience suggests that this approach can also be used for liver and lung transplantation, provided that the warm ischemic time is minimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/27,28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,34</a>].</p><p>A consensus conference was convened by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Division of Transplantation and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to elucidate areas of difficulty for DCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The conference was funded by a number of organizations and had a very broad representation. Group 1 commented and made recommendations for death determination, which requires absent circulation, respiration, and unresponsiveness.</p><p>The conference participants supported the Society for Critical Care Medicine recommendation that &quot;at least two minutes of observation is required, and more than five minutes is not recommended&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Given the emerging consensus of these guidelines, no additional waiting period is warranted after death is certified. A second finding is the recommendation that organizations participating in DCD utilize either the UNOS criteria for determining potential DCD candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] or the University of Wisconsin assessment algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The University of Wisconsin has validated criteria to identify patients who are likely to be able to become DCD after death. These criteria are easily performed and can help decision making regarding whether to proceed with organizing an attempt to perform DCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Another study has validated the UNOS criteria for predicting who is likely to die rapidly enough to permit organ donation following removal of life-sustaining treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11312482\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 50 percent of kidneys and most of the extrarenal solid organs that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors.
