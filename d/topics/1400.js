Enteric-coated aspirin is designed to resist disintegration in the stomach; thus, health care providers and their patients may believe this to be an attractive alternative to conventional aspirin. Although this preparation may reduce erosions on endoscopy, enteric coating does not appear to protect against the clinically relevant end point of gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This finding is not surprising, since injury severe enough to induce bleeding is thought to reflect the systemic rather than just the local effects of aspirin.

Lower bio-availability of these preparations and poor absorption from the higher pH environment of the small intestine may result in inadequate platelet inhibition, particularly in heavier subjects. These data contribute to the formulation of the hypothesis that low-dose, enteric-coated aspirin does not produce adequate platelet inhibition.</p><p>In acute occlusive vascular events (eg, acute coronary syndrome), the necessity to achieve a rapid clinical antithrombotic effect precludes the recommendation of enteric-coated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> because of its delayed absorption. If the only available preparation is enteric coated, the single tablet or multiple tablets necessary to achieve the recommended dose of 325 mg should be crushed or chewed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1016966315\"><span class=\"h1\">BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary safety concern with the chronic use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is bleeding, chiefly from the gastrointestinal tract. In randomized comparisons against placebo, 325 mg daily of aspirin when used for five years leads to about a 1 percent absolute increase in risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Since this absolute increase in risk is far less than the absolute decrease in the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death among a wide range of patients who have survived an occlusive cardiovascular disease event, most secondary prevention patients should be prescribed aspirin for long-term use. (See <a href=\"#H1019438951\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#H1898937\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer&quot;, section on 'Bleeding'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H371279451\"><span class=\"h1\">CESSATION OF ASPIRIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are acute and likely result from antiplatelet effects for the life of the platelet whose half-life is about eight days. Thus, cessation of aspirin may increase risks of complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or stent thrombosis. The major reasons for physician-directed cessation of aspirin therapy have been minor surgery, endoscopy, and dental treatment. However, with respect to surgery, there is increasing evidence that aspirin should be continued in patients at high risk for perioperative occlusive vascular complications (eg, those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or peripheral arterial surgery).
