Thus, delay in diagnosis is common, which may result in the discovery of disease at a late stage and a poor treatment outcome.</p><p>Several tumors can arise within the small bowel, both malignant (adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, lymphoma, and sarcomas) and benign (adenoma, leiomyoma, lipoma). Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and specific tumor types will be reviewed here. Diagnosis, staging, and management of small bowel tumors are discussed separately.

In 1987, the most common histologic types of malignant tumors of the small intestine in population-based registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) were adenocarcinoma, 45 percent; carcinoid, 29 percent; lymphoma, 16 percent; and sarcoma, 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p>In the year 2000, carcinoid tumors surpassed adenocarcinomas as the most common small bowel tumor reported to the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Between 1985 and 2005, the proportion of patients with carcinoids increased from 28 to 44 percent, while the proportion of adenocarcinoma decreased from 42 to 33 percent. The proportion of patients with stromal tumors and lymphoma remained essentially stable (17 and 8 percent, respectively).</p><p>Although these malignancies may be found throughout the different regions of the intestine, certain subtypes have a predilection for specific regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy affecting the duodenum, and carcinoid is the most common tumor in the ileum, while sarcomas and lymphomas can develop throughout the entire small bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The distribution of tumor subtypes according to small bowel location in a combined analysis of data from three registry-based series (the NCDB [1985 to 2005] and United States SEER [1973 to 2005] cohorts, and the Connecticut Tumor Registry [1980 to 2000] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]) is depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109933 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Largely as a result of these differences in distribution, the reported relative incidence of each histology varies considerably with the patient population under study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign lesions that may arise in the small bowel include adenomas, leiomyomas, fibromas, and lipomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following sections will discuss general aspects of the epidemiology of small bowel tumors. Specific epidemiologic aspects of the individual tumor types are discussed below.</p><p>Malignancies involving the small intestine are rare. In the United States, there are approximately 10,470 new cases and 1450 patient deaths from small bowel cancer annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although the small intestine represents approximately 75 percent of the length and over 90 percent of the surface area of the alimentary tract, small bowel malignancies account for only 3 percent of all gastrointestinal tract neoplasms and approximately 0.5 percent of all cancers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>By contrast, approximately 140,250 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Several theories, based upon the unique microenvironment of the small intestine, have been proposed to explain the low rate of small bowel neoplasms relative to large bowel cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The more dilute and liquid contents of the small bowel may cause less mucosal irritation than the more solid contents of the colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relatively rapid transit of intestinal contents through the small bowel may provide for a shorter exposure to carcinogens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The much lower bacterial load (particularly anaerobic bacteria) in the small bowel may result in less conversion of bile acids into potential carcinogens by anaerobic organisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzpyrene, a known carcinogen present in food, is converted to less toxic metabolites by benzpyrene hydroxylase, which is present in higher concentrations in the small intestine compared with the stomach and colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased lymphoid tissue and secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), found in large quantities in the small bowel, may be protective.</p><p/><p>While rates of large bowel cancer have been stable or decreasing over time, the incidence of small bowel cancer appears to be increasing, at least in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/2,5,6,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,14-16</a>]. In older studies, reported age-adjusted incidence rates of small bowel cancer ranged from 1 to 3 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/4,9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,15</a>]. However, in a study analyzing the Connecticut Tumor Registry, a marked rise in the incidence of small bowel tumors over time was noted, with an incidence in the most recent time interval (1994 to 2000) of 14.8 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The degree to which the increased incidence is related to advances in diagnostic imaging is not known. However, much of the increase appears to be driven by a rising incidence of small bowel carcinoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

These findings suggest that similar underlying genetic or environmental factors are involved in the carcinogenesis of adenocarcinomas arising in both the small and large intestine. A number of known heritable cancer syndromes are associated with adenocarcinoma of both the large and small bowel, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

Single, specific germline mutations underlie some common inherited syndromes (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP], hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]), while sporadic cancers result from the stepwise accumulation of multiple somatic mutations, possibly acquired as a result of exposure to carcinogens within the intestinal lumen.

In addition, patients with FAP are predisposed to the development of desmoid tumors, which develop within the small bowel or its mesentery and are often multiple in number (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54879\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54879 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Specific symptoms associated with individual tumor types are discussed below.

Pain is typically intermittent and crampy in nature. Weight loss occurs in 24 to 44 percent, nausea and vomiting in 17 to 64 percent, and gastrointestinal bleeding in 23 to 41 percent. Intestinal obstruction is more common than perforation, occurring in 22 to 26 percent compared with 6 to 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p>As compared with benign tumors, patients with malignant small bowel neoplasms are more often symptomatic, and the majority of symptomatic small bowel tumors are malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/42,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,46</a>]. Furthermore, symptoms at presentation tend to differ between benign and malignant tumors. As an example, in a report of 49 patients with a small bowel neoplasm (17 benign and 32 malignant), 47 percent of benign tumors were asymptomatic (versus 6 percent of malignant tumors), and when symptomatic, they more commonly presented with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage (29 versus 6 percent of malignant tumors). Malignant tumors more commonly presented with abdominal pain (63 versus 24 percent) and weight loss (38 versus 0 percent). Despite these data, clinical presentation alone does not permit the distinction between a benign versus a malignant lesion.</p><p>The often vague and nonspecific nature of the symptoms makes early diagnosis of a malignant small bowel tumor difficult. There may be a significant delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis (in one series, averaging 30 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]). As a result, by the time a patient becomes symptomatic, their disease is usually advanced, with either involvement of regional lymph nodes or distant metastatic sites.</p><p>The differential diagnosis is broad given the nonspecific symptoms. More common causes of small bowel stricturing or obstruction include adhesions, hernia entrapment, inflammatory bowel disease, endometriosis, splenosis, and complications from appendicitis or diverticulitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ADENOCARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenocarcinomas represent from 25 to 40 percent of small bowel cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1,2,5,9,10,45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,9,10,45,47</a>].

The most common symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome, which usually does not occur until the bioactive amines have gained access to the systemic circulation (typically in the setting of liver metastases), are watery diarrhea and flushing. In symptomatic patients, abdominal pain is the most common initial symptom, occurring in approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Possibly contributing to the ischemic process is the vasospastic effect of serotonin produced by the tumor (see below).</p><p>Metastatic disease, which is present in 90 percent of symptomatic patients, correlates not only with the depth of invasion and location, but also the size of the primary lesion.

Because of their indolent growth, most are asymptomatic at presentation and found incidentally. When present, symptoms generally relate to mass effects, including intermittent obstruction. Tumor production of bioactive amines results in the carcinoid syndrome (watery diarrhea, flushing, sweating, wheezing, dyspnea, abdominal pain, hypotension) only when the secretory products gain direct access to the systemic circulation, thus avoiding metabolism in the liver; this occurs most commonly in patients with extensive hepatic metastases.
