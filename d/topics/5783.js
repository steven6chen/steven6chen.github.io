Normally, activation of the right atrium occurs first, followed by left atrial activation, sometimes leading to slight physiologic notching of the P wave. Delay of left atrial activation (interatrial block), as may result from left atrial distension, hypertrophy, scarring, or conduction delay, causes the P wave on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) to become broadened and often substantially notched, with an interpeak interval &gt;0.04 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79437 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52162\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52162 \">waveform 1</a>). The voltage of the terminal portion of the P wave is increased if there is left atrial enlargement (&ldquo;P mitrale&rdquo;), reflecting left atrial depolarization.</p><p>These ECG changes are most apparent in the inferior leads. Leads V1 and V2 show a deeply inverted or negative portion of the P wave (reflecting left atrial activation, which is directed posteriorly) with an area that is greater than that of the initial upright portion of the P wave (reflecting right atrial activation, which is directed anteriorly). The negative portion of the P wave in V1 is &gt;1 mm wide and &gt;1 mm deep, with normal voltage and sweep speed settings. If the P wave in V1 is completely negative, this usually reflects left atrial abnormality, but may be normal or indicate an ectopic atrial focus or lead malposition. In lead II, the P wave is &ge;.12 seconds. The left atrial vector may also increase toward the left (-30&deg; to -90&deg;) if left atrial enlargement progresses and becomes more pronounced, resulting in a negative terminal deflection of the P wave in leads III and aVF. </p><p>As noted below, a narrow but prominent, entirely negative P wave in lead V1 may also, paradoxically, occur in certain cases of right atrial abnormality, especially when the right atrium is located below the level of the V1 electrode. In such cases, tall, peaked P waves are usually seen in the inferior leads, more typical of right atrial abnormality (&ldquo;P pulmonale&rdquo;).</p><p>The following criteria suggest left atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">enlargement/abnormality</span> when correlated with echocardiographic data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative phase of P in V1 &gt;0.04 sec &ndash; sensitivity 83 percent; specificity 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative phase of P in V1 &gt;1 mm &ndash; sensitivity 60 percent; specificity 93 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P-terminal force &gt;0.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/sec</span> &ndash; sensitivity 69 percent; specificity 93 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Notched P, interpeak interval &gt;0.04 sec &ndash; sensitivity 15 percent; specificity 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P wave duration &gt;0.11 sec &ndash; sensitivity 33 percent; specificity 88 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P <span class=\"nowrap\">wave/PR</span> duration &gt;1.6 &ndash; sensitivity 31 percent; specificity 64 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6705790\"><span class=\"h2\">Interatrial block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interatrial block reflects delay of conduction to the left atrium, usually at the level of the Bachmann bundle. Diagnosis of interatrial block versus left atrial abnormality can be difficult or impossible from the surface ECG. First degree interatrial block is recognized by a P wave &ge;.12 sec, which is usually bimodal in leads I, II, or III. This common finding in the elderly may be seen in those with no evidence of left atrial enlargement on imaging. So-called third degree interatrial block is much less frequently seen. There is absent conduction through the interatrial septum and conduction to the left atrium occurs through the coronary sinus musculature. The ECG criteria are a P wave &ge;0.12 sec, with a bimodal P wave in lead I and aVL and biphasic P wave (positive then negative) in leads II, III, and aVF, and frequently also in V1-V2. Second degree interatrial block has been defined by a pattern of changing P wave morphology from normal to interatrial block or from first degree to third degree interatrial block. </p><p>First degree interatrial block with a prolonged P wave duration, especially with a P wave &gt;.123 sec, has been associated with an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-chamber-enlargement-and-hypertrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Third degree interatrial block has been associated with supraventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-chamber-enlargement-and-hypertrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RIGHT ATRIAL ABNORMALITY/ENLARGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed activation of the right atrium as a result of dilatation, hypertrophy, scarring, or a conduction abnormality leads to simultaneous activation of the right and left atria. This synchronous electrical activity has an additive effect upon the surface electrocardiogram, resulting in a relatively narrow P wave that is of increased amplitude (&ldquo;P pulmonale&rdquo;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63181\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63181 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78126\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78126 \">waveform 2</a>). The most common finding is a P wave &gt;2.5 mm in lead II. In addition, a P wave &gt;1.5 mm in V1 or V2 or a P wave that has a rightward axis may be seen. The amplitude of the P wave may become significantly increased in the presence of right atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">hypertrophy/overload,</span> and it becomes peaked due to the increase in amount of depolarized tissue. If the right atrium becomes sufficiently large, it may extend toward the left, causing P waves in V1 to be inverted and giving the illusion of left atrial enlargement. In contrast to left atrial abnormality or interatrial block, the P wave duration is usually normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present when there is substantially increased LV muscle mass associated with concentric, eccentric, or asymmetric patterns. LVH is usually the result of an increase in systolic pressure generated by the LV in response to increased resistance to contraction; this type of pressure load most commonly occurs with long-standing hypertension or aortic outflow obstruction, particularly aortic stenosis. LVH can also be due to sustained mitral or aortic regurgitation (volume loads) or to dilated cardiomyopathies. More rarely, LVH can also be associated with other diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and its variants.</p><p>It takes longer for an electrical impulse to traverse the hypertrophied ventricular muscle, and the amplitude of the impulse is increased since there is a greater muscle mass. Thus, the QRS complex has an increased amplitude and is often slightly widened, reflecting an intraventricular conduction delay (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69040\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69040 \">waveform 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy&quot;</a>.) The widening is primarily observed as an initial slowing in the inscription of the QRS complex to &gt;0.04 seconds (the time to reach the peak of the R wave is delayed); this is known as a delay in the intrinsicoid deflection. A similar pattern of tall QRS voltage may be seen in young people who have thin chest walls; however, in these patients, the intrinsicoid deflection is normal and there is no hypertrophy or delay in activation or conduction. </p><p>The changes of LVH are often associated with other electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left atrial abnormality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left axis deviation due to the increased mass of left ventricular muscle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment and T wave abnormalities (downsloping ST segment depression and T wave inversion)</p><p/><p>The ST-T wave abnormalities have often been termed a &quot;strain pattern,&quot; though are now more frequently described as &ldquo;LVH with associated ST-T wave abnormalities.&rdquo; They probably represent either subendocardial ischemia, which results from a relative lack of blood and oxygen supply to the hypertrophied muscle as demand is greater than supply, or repolarization abnormalities of the hypertrophied cardiac muscle. The changes are most frequently seen in the left lateral leads (I, aVL, V5-6); they may also occur in the inferior leads when a vertical heart is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been multiple ECG criteria proposed for diagnosing LVH.

A score of 5 or more indicates &quot;definite&quot; LVH; a score of 4 indicates &quot;probable&quot; LVH.</p><p/><p>Among the most specific (although not sensitive) criterion is the amplitude of the R wave in lead aVL; LVH is present when this is greater than 11 mm (or 18 mm in the presence of left axis deviation). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RIGHT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is present when there is a pathologic increase in muscle mass of the right ventricle. This may be seen with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic stenosis, or severe lung disease and cor pulmonale. There are multiple criteria for the diagnosis of RVH that have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-chamber-enlargement-and-hypertrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, no one set of criteria has sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to allow it to be used to screen for RVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-chamber-enlargement-and-hypertrophy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The RV forces become predominant in patients with RVH (especially due to a pressure load as with pulmonic outflow obstruction or severe pulmonary hypertension), producing tall R waves in the right precordial leads (V1 and V2), and deep S waves in the left precordial leads (V5 and V6) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63763\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63763 \">waveform 4</a>). Because of the increase in the amplitude of the R wave and decrease in the depth of the S wave, the R:S ratio in V1 &gt;1 is suggestive of RVH. However, there are other causes of an increased R:S ratio in adults that must be excluded before a diagnosis of RVH can be definitively established (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72039 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right bundle branch block</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior wall myocardial infarction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern (especially due to lateral or poster-lateral left ventricular pre-excitation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (septal hypertrophy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early precordial transition (counterclockwise rotation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal or positional variant </p><p/><p>Obtaining an R:S ratio &gt;1 from a right sided precordial lead (V3R or V4R) may be a more reliable indicator of RVH.</p><p>Right axis deviation (axis &gt;+90&ordm;-100&ordm;) is often present with RVH.

Tall (normal duration) right precordial R waves (as part of R, RS, or qR morphologies) with right axis deviation, as noted above, are most likely to be associated with severe RV pressure overloads due to pulmonic stenosis (and its variants) or pulmonary hypertension from causes other than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (eg, primary pulmonary hypertension or recurrent pulmonary emboli). Pulmonary hypertension due to severe COPD (emphysema) may be associated with very slow R wave progression, delayed precordial transition zone, and right axis deviation. In contrast, RVH due to a classic volume load state (eg, ostium secundum atrial septal defect) may be associated with RV conduction delay and right axis deviation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">BIVENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biventricular hypertrophy is suggested on the electrocardiogram if there are voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, combined with right axis deviation, prominent R wave in V1-V2, prominent S wave in V5-6, tall biphasic <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S</span> complexes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right atrial abnormality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75570\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75570 \">waveform 5</a>).
