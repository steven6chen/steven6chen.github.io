Human mortality from rabies is estimated at 59,000 deaths per year. Most cases occur in Africa and Asia, and result primarily from canine reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, there has been an average of two fatal human rabies cases annually since 1980, 30 percent of them being imported cases with exposures occurring abroad; the majority of indigenous cases have been associated with exposure to bats.</p><p>Rabies is virtually always fatal, but infection can be prevented with proper wound care and prompt post-exposure prophylaxis. In the United States, approximately 16,000 to 39,000 patients with contact to potentially rabid animals receive rabies post-exposure prophylaxis annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The safety, efficacy, and administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> will be reviewed here.

RIG is derived from pooled plasma samples of hyperimmunized human donors (human RIG; HRIG) or from horses (equine RIG; ERIG). Both preparations are considered equally potent and effective; however, only HRIG is recommended for use in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although these products are derived from human donors or horses, they are treated in ways that eliminate infectious agents, and no transmission of infectious agents has yet been documented from either product. </p><p>The recommended dose of HRIG is 20 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> in all age groups. Outside the United States, if ERIG is used (including F(ab')2 products), the dose is 40 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight. RIG can partially suppress antibody production, so no more than the single recommended dose should be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>As much of the RIG dose as is anatomically feasible should be infiltrated in the area around and in the wounds.

Despite the potential advantages of ERIG, during the past two decades several major manufacturers have discontinued ERIG production because of costs, pressures from animal rights activists, and more requirements from national regulatory authorities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Due to global shortages of HRIG and ERIG and the expense of production, alternate means of prophylaxis are being sought.

In an animal model, these monoclonal antibodies provided a level of protection against lethal rabies virus challenge similar to HRIG.</p><p>In the first clinical study among healthy adults in the United States and India, CR57 and CR4098 were safe and well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. All subjects had adequate neutralizing activity against rabies virus from day 14 onward when administered in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a>. Another neutralizing monoclonal antibody (SII RMAb) has also shown promise and appears safe and noninferior to HRIG in rabies virus neutralizing antibody activity as measured by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

A retrospective review of adverse events following immunization with PCECV was conducted using data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) over an eight-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Mild side effects included headache, fever, myalgia, nausea, and weakness. Serious adverse events were uncommon (3 per 100,000 doses distributed). Hypersensitivity to PCECV is less well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]; however, HDCV vaccine can replace PCECV if hypersensitivity develops with the use of that product as the initial vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Purified vero cell </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a><strong> (PVRV) </strong>&ndash; Like HDCV and PCECV, PVRV is associated with both local and systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a study of 60 healthy adult volunteers who received a pre-exposure vaccine series of a new PVRV vaccine either intramuscularly or intradermally, or a previously licensed PVRV vaccine intramuscularly, 116 adverse events were reported across all three groups. Twenty-eight local reactions included pain at the injection site, erythema, pruritus, induration, and edema. All local reactions were judged to be relatively mild and resolved rapidly. Eighty-eight systemic reactions were comprised primarily of headache, arthralgia, and myalgia and were self-limiting. There were no significant differences in the type of rate of reported local or system reactions between the three groups.</p><p/><p>Rare case reports of neurologic adverse events (eg, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barr&eacute;) following rabies vaccination have also been reported; however, causality has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Clinicians in the United States who require assistance in the management of a patient with significant hypersensitivity should contact their <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/contacts.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLP34avy7K48jfK0PvxCnCh3r9Biz1uu56+Yn0IY7HtcwZl6JErfqwi8KMF/rvK5VwQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=8303\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">state health department rabies consultant</a> or the CDC.

The proper route and sites of administration are critical to optimize the protective efficacy and prevent vaccine failure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rabies vaccines should be administered intramuscularly. The deltoid is the only acceptable intramuscular site for vaccine administration in adults and older children, although the outer aspect of the thigh can be used for young children. The gluteal muscle should <strong>NOT</strong> be used for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> since antibody responses have been lower after administration at that site.

The primary series for pre-exposure prophylaxis includes three doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74185 \">table 1</a>). A booster vaccine should be administered to those with ongoing risk when neutralizing antibodies decline to less than protective levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H122975002\" class=\"local\">'Regimens for pre-exposure prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1343198751\" class=\"local\">'Postvaccination serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-exposure prophylaxis includes proper wound care and administration of rabies biologics (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> with or without RIG) to elicit neutralizing antibodies after a rabies exposure. (See <a href=\"#H3064587762\" class=\"local\">'Post-exposure prophylaxis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once it has been determined that the patient should receive rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, prophylaxis should begin as soon as possible after the exposure. The decision to initiate prophylaxis requires a careful risk assessment and depends upon the type of exposure, the local rabies epidemiology, the circumstances of the exposure incident, and the availability of the animal for observation or rabies testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71322\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Dosing schedules, doses, and routes of administration are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70600 \">table 2</a>), but, in certain resource-limited settings, may be modified to maximize the availability of vaccine.

However, if a delay of only a few days occurs, the schedule should simply resume with intervals preserved within the new schedule. By contrast, antibody titers should be assessed to evaluate efficacy if the dosing schedule has been significantly violated. (See <a href=\"#H3169355442\" class=\"local\">'Deviations from immunization regimens'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1343198751\" class=\"local\">'Postvaccination serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both rabies immunoglobulin and rabies vaccines have been associated with local reactions.
