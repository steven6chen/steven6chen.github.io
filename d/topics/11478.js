LMX1B is a transcription factor of the LIM-homeodomain type that plays an important role for limb and renal development in vertebrates; however, it is expressed lifelong within the podocyte and it is essential for the maintenance the structured actin cytoskeleton in podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More than 140 heterozygous mutations in <em>LMX1B</em> have been reported, including missense, splicing, deletions, and nonsense mutations. Most mutations result in protein truncation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/3,7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,9-11</a>].

These findings are typically bilateral and symmetrical, and may be observed at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Toenails are usually less frequently involved than fingernails and have less severe abnormalities. If the toenails are involved, it is often the little toenail that is most affected. Thumbnails are the most severely affected of the fingernails and the severity tends to decrease towards the little finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98100 \">picture 1</a>).

In patients with patellar hypoplasia, recurrent subluxation or dislocation of the patella causes lateral slippage during knee flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/4,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,24</a>]. In one large case series of 124 patients, three-quarters of the cohort reported knee symptoms including pain, knee instability, locking of the knee, inability to straighten the knee joint, and patellar dislocation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elbow abnormalities &ndash; Almost all patients with NPS have elbow abnormalities, including posterior subluxation of the radial head, hypoplasia of the lateral epicondyle and capitellum, and prominence of the medial epicondyle. Elbow abnormalities may be asymmetrical. Symptoms and findings due to these deformities include pain, limited elbow extension, limited pronation and supination, cubitus valgus (increased carrying angle of the arm), and pterygia (webbing of the elbow).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg and arm abnormalities &ndash; Almost all patients exhibit underdevelopment of arm and leg proximal musculature and hyperextensibility of large joints (eg, hip).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliac horns are bilateral symmetrical bone formations arising from the antero-superior iliac crest that project posteriorly and laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98098\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98098 \">image 2</a>). Iliac horns are pathognomonic asymptomatic radiologic features of NPS, and are present in 70 to 80 percent of patients. Large horns may be detected by palpation on clinical examination. Iliac horns may also be detected by prenatal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ankle and feet abnormalities &ndash; Ankle and feet deformities include talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), calcaneovalgus (hyperdorsiflexion of the foot with abduction of the forefoot), pes planus (flat foot), and tight Achilles tendon.</p><p/><p>Orthopedic surgeons most experienced with NPS generally discourage any attempts at orthopedic &quot;repair&quot; of limb and pelvic abnormalities due to the profound defect in the baseline structures. When an orthopedic intervention is planned, it is important to determine if there are any abnormal bone or soft tissue abnormalities that could be affected by the procedure. For example, in patients with elbow pterygia, the neurovascular bundle may be superficial and within the confines of the webbing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, patients with NPS often have abnormal joint anatomy, which is important to determine prior to surgical intervention so that the appropriate intervention can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal disease (30 to 40 percent) varies among affected families and within single families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Because the underlying pathology is a defect in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), patients with renal involvement initially present with microalbuminuria and proteinuria. Proteinuria may present at any age or be intermittent, and is more prevalent during pregnancy. Microscopic hematuria is also common.</p><p>Although there are no longitudinal data that provide information on the long-term renal prognosis, there is limited evidence that patients with NPS have an accelerated loss of renal function that is twice the normal aging rate of unaffected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Some patients with proteinuria will develop nephrotic syndrome and infrequently (1 to 5 percent of all patients) progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Impairment of renal function, and in a small minority of patients, ESRD, is thought to be due to progressive thickening and disorganization of the GBM. In addition, as noted above, <em>LMX1B</em> mutation (R246 missense mutation) has been associated with familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), but without any other clinical features of NPS. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and LMX1B gene mutations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathologic findings from renal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NPS is distinguished from other diseases associated with proteinuria by the electron microscopic pathognomic finding of irregular and lucent rarefactions containing clusters of cross-banded collagen fibrils within the lamina densa of the GBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. These abnormalities may also be found in the mesangial matrix, but the tubular basement membranes are not affected. The clusters of fibrils are clearly demonstrated by staining with uranyl acetate and phosphotungstic acid. They may be observed within segments of thickened GBM or along the entire GBM. Although the collagen fibrils are a constant feature of NPS, they are also found in patients without clinical evidence of renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, there is no correlation between the severity of the ultrastructural lesions and the clinical renal manifestations.</p><p>In contrast, light microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy are normal or demonstrate nonspecific changes. In patients with heavy proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired renal function, light microscopy may show GBM thickening and nonspecific lesions of FSGS, and immunofluorescence microscopy may show nonspecific segmental deposits of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and complement component 3 (C3) in the sclerotic areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2754803\"><span class=\"h2\">Other findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2754810\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensorineural hearing loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one case series of 106 patients, sensorineural hearing loss was observed in 11 of 24 patients from four of six families who underwent audiometric testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-patella-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, the overall prevalence of hearing loss is unclear. In this study, bilateral involvement was observed in one-third of the cases with hearing impairment.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPS is due to mutations of the <em>LMX1B</em> gene, a transcription factor of the LIM-homeodomain type that plays an important role for limb and renal development. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and LMX1B gene mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical manifestations and their relative frequency of NPS include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nail and distal digital abnormalities (100 percent) include nail hypoplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98100 \">picture 1</a>) and dystropic changes (discoloration, abnormal ridging and splitting, and triangular lunulae [pathognomic finding] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98561\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98561 \">picture 2</a>)), and distal digital changes include loss of the creases in the skin overlying the distal interphalangeal joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98563\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98563 \">picture 3</a>), and flexion and extension abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H2753449\" class=\"local\">'Nail and digital abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limb and pelvic abnormalities (100 percent) include patellar aplasia or hypoplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98562\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98562 \">image 1</a>), elbow abnormalities, and the pathognomic finding of iliac horns (80 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98098\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98098 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2753328\" class=\"local\">'Limb and pelvic abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal disease (30 to 40 percent) initially presents with microalbuminuria and proteinuria. Some patients will progress to nephrosis and infrequently (1 to 5 percent of all patients) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Renal manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other manifestations include sensorineural hearing loss, ophthalmological disease (ie, glaucoma, and intraocular hypertension), gastrointestinal complaints, back pain, and vasomotor and distal neurological symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2754803\" class=\"local\">'Other findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of NPS is based on the presence of classical physical and radiologic findings. These include nail abnormalities (eg, triangular lunulae), patellar hypoplasia or aplasia, elbow abnormalities, and the radiologic finding of iliac horns. In cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain, molecular genetic testing to detect a mutation of the <em>LMX1B</em> gene is usually used to confirm the diagnosis. Renal biopsy is not warranted, as it is not typically needed to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2753162\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of NPS is made, evaluation is recommended to determine the extent of the disease. This entails a comprehensive history and physical examination to detect orthopedic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, or vasomotor abnormalities; and screening for renal and ophthalmologic disease. (See <a href=\"#H2755367\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation following initial diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no specific therapy for NPS.
