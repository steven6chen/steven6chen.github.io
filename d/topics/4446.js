Its phosphorylated form (creatine-phosphate or phosphocreatine) is involved in the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as an energy source for a number of intracellular metabolic processes.</p><p>There are three identified congenital metabolic disorders that lead to creatine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Two are autosomal recessive disorders that affect the biosynthesis of creatine. They are arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102603 \">figure 1</a>). The third disorder, X-linked creatine transporter (CT) deficiency, is caused by a defect in the transport of creatine into the brain and muscle.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of these disorders are reviewed here. Other inborn errors of metabolism are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Classification&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-identifying-the-specific-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Identifying the specific disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548068715\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section briefly reviews creatine metabolism and transport. It also reviews the common clinical features and the general diagnostic and treatment approaches for these disorders. The unique clinical features and management approaches are discussed in the separate sections on each disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439452062\"><span class=\"h2\">Creatine metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creatine synthesis involves two enzymatic steps and occurs primarily in the liver, kidney, and pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102603 \">figure 1</a>). The first step involves L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), which catalyzes the formation of guanidinoacetate (GAA) from arginine and glycine. The second involves guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), which catalyzes the formation of creatinine from GAA and S-adenosylmethionine. Creatine is taken up by the tissues, mainly brain and muscle, by the creatine transporter (CT). It is nonenzymatically converted to creatinine and excreted into the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439452068\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the primary features of congenital disorders of creatine metabolism and transport is intellectual disability, which can range from mild to severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102604 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Clinical manifestations also may include behavioral problems, autism, speech delay, epilepsy, and movement disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additional features seen in patients with AGAT and CT deficiencies include myopathy and muscular hypotrophy, respectively. In general, GAMT deficiency had a more severe phenotype than AGAT or CT deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439452074\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with intellectual disability associated with autistic behaviors should be screened for congenital disorders of creatine metabolism. Initial screening for disorders of creatine synthesis and transport include measurement of the creatine signal in the brain by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and measurement of GAA, creatine, and creatinine in the urine, plasma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102604 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. The laboratory studies are easier to obtain, less costly, and do not require invasive sedation and, therefore, are normally performed first. Measurement of levels in the urine only is generally sufficient. However, MRS is more sensitive and specific and, therefore, is usually performed as a confirmatory test.</p><p>There is almost complete depletion of the cerebral creatine pool on brain MRS in all patients with AGAT and GAMT deficiencies and in males with CT deficiency. Cerebral creatine levels are partially depleted to normal in females with CT deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the genetic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Functional testing by assaying enzymatic activity in cultured skin fibroblasts (GAMT) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts (GAMT and AGAT) is performed if genetic testing is inconclusive; for example, if a new mutation of unknown pathogenicity is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible in families where the disease-causing mutation has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. GAMT deficiency can also be identified by measurement of GAA in blood spot cards. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is extracted from the blood spot card for GAMT molecular analysis if the GAA value is above the cutoff. Pilot newborn screening projects are underway, although no cases of the rare disorder have been identified yet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Methods suitable for newborn screening for AGAT deficiency or CT deficiency have not been developed, since testing using the available biomarkers is not sufficiently reliable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439452080\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the three known congenital disorders of CT and metabolism, there are disorders that may have associated secondary deficiency of cerebral creatine, including argininosuccinic aciduria (due to argininosuccinate lyase deficiency), citrullinemia type 1 (due to argininosuccinate synthetase enzyme deficiency), and gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (due to ornithine aminotransferase enzyme deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These patients have partial cerebral creatine deficiency identified by MRS, but a normal urine creatine-to-creatinine ratio, and unremarkable or nonspecific changes of GAA concentrations in body fluids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439452122\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of timely diagnosis and treatment of congenital disorders of creatine biosynthesis and transport is to prevent or at least minimize brain damage and development of the associated clinical manifestations. An understanding that correction of cerebral creatine depletion will improve clinical outcomes has driven the development of treatment strategies. These strategies include oral supplementation of high-dose creatine-monohydrate for all three congenital creatine deficiency disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102604 \">table 1</a>). GAA-reducing strategies (high-dose ornithine, arginine-restricted diet) are additional treatment measures for GAMT deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Supplementation of substrates for intracerebral creatine synthesis (eg, arginine, glycine) is also usually used to treat CT deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>Treatment is associated with a significant increase of cerebral creatine levels and reduction of urinary, plasma, and CSF GAA levels as well as improvement or stabilization of clinical symptoms in all symptomatic cases of GAMT deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in normal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar findings are reported for treatment of AGAT deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/10,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,18</a>], but treatment of CT deficiency has been less successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H752831637\"><span class=\"h1\">ARGININE:GLYCINE AMIDINOTRANSFERASE (AGAT) DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AGAT deficiency (MIM #612718) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the <em>GATM</em> gene located at 15q15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This defect results in reduced guanidinoacetate (GAA) levels in the urine and plasma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102604 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102603 \">figure 1</a>).

Their clinical features included mild to moderate intellectual disability, autistic behavior, speech and language delay, and occasional seizures. Depletion of brain creatine was reversible with creatine supplementation and was associated with clinical improvement.</p><p>Myopathy is a manifestation that appears later in the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. This was first noted in two siblings, ages 18 and 12 years, from a Yemenite Jewish family, who had a childhood history of poor weight gain, developmental delay, and fatigability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. They both went on to have proximal muscle weakness, with moderately elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels (500 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> and a myopathic electromyography. Findings on muscle biopsy included tubular aggregates and decreased respiratory chain enzyme activity. Strength and stamina improved after treatment with supplemental creatine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548068827\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of AGAT deficiency consists of 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of oral creatine supplementation (administered as creatine-monohydrate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This therapy is effective in replenishing the cerebral creatine pool and improving developmental outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/5,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,23</a>]. It is also effective in patients with myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Early treatment may prevent the development of intellectual disability and other disease manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Measurement of cerebral creatine levels by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to monitor the therapeutic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], in addition to following clinical outcomes (eg, muscle weakness, cognitive and behavioral function).</p><p>Case reports suggest that the best results are seen with early diagnosis and treatment. As an example, the younger sibling of two sisters with AGAT deficiency was diagnosed prenatally and started on creatine supplementation at four months of age. This boy demonstrated normal development at 18 months of age, in contrast to his two older siblings, who had developmental delay at that age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. A cousin of these children was diagnosed and started on treatment at two years of age. He had a borderline normal intelligence quotient (IQ) at eight years of age, whereas two other affected relatives who were not started on treatment until five and seven years of age had moderate intellectual disability at the ages 11 and 13 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20006918\"><span class=\"h1\">GUANIDINOACETATE METHYLTRANSFERASE (GAMT) DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GAMT deficiency (MIM #612736) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the <em>GAMT</em> gene located at 19p13.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Developmental delay and intellectual disability range from severe to mild. Expressive speech is impaired and is often resistant to treatment interventions. Most individuals with GAMT deficiency have behavioral disturbances that can include autistic features, aggression, hyperactivity, and self-mutilation. A significant proportion of patients have neurologic manifestations, including pyramidal and extrapyramidal movement disorders and epilepsy.</p><p>Specific neurologic findings in young children include hypotonia, ataxia, and hyperkinetic extrapyramidal movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/16,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25-27</a>]. Intermittent ataxia during febrile illnesses was reported in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dystonia occurs later in the disease course. Chorea, including new onset of choreatic storm, and hemiballism have been described in other patients. Additionally, there are reports of presentations masquerading as Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Seizures can be absence or tonic-clonic, focal or generalized. Specific seizure types reported include atonic seizures with head <span class=\"nowrap\">drop/nodding,</span> myoclonic seizures, myoclonic astatic seizures (myoclonic followed by atonic), and infantile spasms. Electroencephalography (EEG) changes are usually nonspecific, but several patients have demonstrated high-amplitude theta-delta background activities with multifocal spikes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/16,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27</a>]. Basal ganglia changes occur mostly on the globus pallidus, with bilateral hypointensities in T1-weighted images and hyperintensities in T2-weighted images seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548073821\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy for GAMT deficiency has a dual aim: reduction of GAA levels and restoration of cerebral creatine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. Oral supplementation of creatine is used to restore cerebral creatine levels. Higher doses of creatine-monohydrate (400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> orally or enterally) are often required to treat GAMT deficiency compared with arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There are several strategies to reduce GAA levels, including competitive inhibition of AGAT activity via high-dose L-ornithine supplementation (400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> orally or enterally) and substrate deprivation via an arginine-restricted diet. Additionally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium benzoate</a> is a potential adjunctive treatment to reduce the production of GAA via conjugation with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys.</p><p>GAA levels are reduced by following an arginine-restricted diet, which consists of consuming 0.3 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of natural protein that contains approximately 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of L-arginine together with an arginine-free essential amino acid supplement to achieve the age-related daily required intake (DRI) for protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is unclear if a low-protein diet, consisting of 0.8 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of natural protein, with or without supplementation of an arginine-free formula, reduces GAA accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548068934\"><span class=\"h1\">CREATINE TRANSPORTER (CT) DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT deficiency (MIM #300352) is the most common of the congenital disorders of CT and metabolism.

The prevalence of this disorder in at-risk populations, such as males with intellectual disability, epilepsy, or autism spectrum disorder, is approximately 1 to 3.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548073844\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT deficiency typically presents in the first six years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The most common findings include intellectual disability that progresses with age, severe expressive speech delay, epilepsy, and autistic disorders. Seizures are usually intermittent and treatment responsive. They can occur with or without fever. Reported behavioral problems include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), social anxiety, impulsivity, and aggression. Additional clinical manifestations include dysmorphic facial features (broad forehead, mid-face hypoplasia, ptosis, short nose) and slender, poorly developed muscles with hypotonia. Hyperextensible joints and ataxic and dystonic movement disorders have also been reported.</p><p>Single-case reports include gastrointestinal (chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">constipation/ileus),</span> urogenital, ophthalmologic, and hearing abnormalities as well as cardiomyopathy, delayed myelination, thin corpus callosum, and progressive <span class=\"nowrap\">cerebral/cerebellar</span> atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>].</p><p>An association was identified between mutations with residual activity and relatively milder phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Creatinine excretion is low due to decreased creatine concentration in muscle and brain tissue. The urinary creatine to creatinine is increased in males and is a useful screening tool. However, the urinary levels of creatine and creatinine in heterozygous females are closer to normal. Thus, the ratio is often normal to only mildly elevated and is not a useful screening tool in females.

Creatine supplementation is administered as monotherapy or in combination with supraphysiologic oral doses of the creatine precursors, L-arginine (400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glycine (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day),</span> to enhance cerebral creatine synthesis.</p><p>There are several apparent barriers to correction of the clinical and biochemical features of CT deficiency. CT is not expressed in astrocytes in rodents, although this finding has not been confirmed in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, coexpression of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) in brain cells is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thus, uptake of GAA by the CT is required to synthesize sufficient creatine in the brain. Furthermore, failure of neurons to reuptake endogenously synthesized creatine leads to increased turnover in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-disorders-of-creatine-metabolism/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H426614997\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two autosomal recessive disorders that affect the biosynthesis of creatine: arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102603 \">figure 1</a>). A third congenital metabolic disorder that is X linked, creatine transporter (CT) deficiency, is caused by a defect in the transport of creatine into the brain and muscle. (See <a href=\"#H548073446\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1439452062\" class=\"local\">'Creatine metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the primary features of congenital disorders of CT and metabolism is intellectual disability, which can range from mild to severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102604 \">table 1</a>). Clinical manifestations also may include behavioral problems, autism, speech delay, epilepsy, and movement disorders. Additional features seen in patients with AGAT and CT deficiencies include myopathy and muscular hypotrophy. CT deficiency also has several unique features. In general, GAMT deficiency had a more severe phenotype than AGAT or CT deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H1439452068\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H752831637\" class=\"local\">'Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20006918\" class=\"local\">'Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H548068934\" class=\"local\">'Creatine transporter (CT) deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with intellectual disability associated with autistic behaviors should be screened for congenital disorders of creatine metabolism. A marked reduction of the creatine signal in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain is an indicator of disorders of creatine biosynthesis and transport. Determination of urinary guanidinoacetate (GAA) and the urinary creatine-to-creatinine ratio (Cr:Crn) is fundamental to the diagnosis and ruling out other disorders. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the genetic defect. An assay of enzymatic activity is performed if genetic testing is inconclusive. (See <a href=\"#H1439452074\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1439452080\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H548068934\" class=\"local\">'Creatine transporter (CT) deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment strategies include oral supplementation of high-dose creatine-monohydrate for all three congenital disorders of creatine biosynthesis and metabolism. GAA-reducing strategies (high-dose ornithine, arginine-restricted diet) are additional treatment strategies for GAMT deficiency. Supplementation of substrates for intracerebral creatine synthesis (arginine, glycine) is often also used to treat CT deficiency. Treatment is associated with significant biochemical and clinical improvement or stabilization in patients with AGAT and GAMT deficiencies. Early treatment and diagnosis of these two disorders can result in normal development. Therapy has been less successful for CT deficiency.
