This targeting allows treatment of small- or moderate-sized tumors in either a single or limited number of dose fractions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) initially were used successfully for intracranial, orbital, and base of skull tumors, as well as benign conditions in which the skull could be used as a reference system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The success of SRS for intracranial indications led to the development of techniques to extend this approach to extracranial targets. Stereotactic radiation therapy for extracranial sites has required significant technical advances including tumor imaging to guide radiation administration, patient immobilization, and conformal radiation delivery techniques.</p><p>SBRT has been defined by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) as the use of very large doses of radiation, defined as &gt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">Gy/fraction</span> given over few (five or fewer) fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. SBRT has unique radiobiological characteristics, which can cause dramatic tumor response, leading to the associated term &quot;ablative&quot; radiotherapy.</p><p>The rationale for SBRT in treating both primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic lung tumors, specific techniques, and early results with this technique will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES FOR LUNG TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proximity of lung tumors to critical thoracic structures requires that the high doses of oligofractionated radiation therapy used in SBRT be delivered accurately and precisely to minimize normal tissue exposure to radiation. SBRT thus requires reliable and reproducible patient immobilization, daily imaging for accurate repositioning from simulation to treatment, use of multiple treatment fields, and a method of accounting for tumor and organ motion during treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient positioning and immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent, reproducible, and comfortable patient immobilization is essential for ensuring treatment accuracy.</p><p>There are several commercially available systems designed for stereotactic patient positioning and immobilization, including body frames, vacuum cushions, and thermal plastic restraints. These devices typically feature a stereotactic fiducial system that is rigidly attached and registered to the target. Other, so called &quot;frameless&quot; systems rely on methods to effectively relocate a reference position within the patient. As an example, implanted fiducial seeds within the tumor can be accurately relocated on a daily basis using imaging techniques. Newer technologies under development include electromagnetic transponders that can be tracked throughout treatment to ensure accurate positioning during the entire treatment course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Image-guided treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sophisticated image guidance, typically with computed tomography (CT), is incorporated into the treatment unit and allows validation of patient positioning prior to each treatment. Image-guided radiation therapy minimizes the uncertainty associated with external reference points and allows accurate tumor localization in near real time. Because lung tumors are very distinct on CT scan, pretreatment reference volumes can be linked to the image and appropriate adjustments can be reliably made on the day of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor motion control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung tumors often move relative to other thoracic structures during the respiratory cycle. This motion can vary significantly depending upon the location of the tumor and patient characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Several methods exist to reduce or compensate for tumor motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal compression places a pressure device on the abdomen to reduce motion related to the diaphragm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep inspiration and breath holding attempts to arrest the tumor in a reproducible position within the respiratory cycle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory gating combines these approaches to trigger delivery of radiation during a specific segment of the respiratory cycle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor tracking systems actually move the radiation beam to follow the motion of the tumor.</p><p/><p>Regardless of the method used, careful assurance of accuracy, reproducibility, as well as implementation of motion data into treatment planning, is essential for precise treatment delivery with SBRT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SBRT utilizes advanced treatment planning approaches to minimize radiation exposure outside the planned tumor volume. This is accomplished by using multiple beams (typically 10 to 12) or large angle arc rotations. Use of nonopposing beams is encouraged to avoid overlap of dose at points of entrance and exit. In most circumstances, noncoplanar beams are preferred to further spread out the entrance and exit dose within normal tissues.</p><p>Target volumes are determined using mechanisms to predict and quantify tumor motion such as four-dimensional CT and fluoroscopy. Intravenous contrast is potentially useful, even for small tumors, to differentiate tumor (intermediate density) from atelectasis (low density) and adjacent vessels (high density). When tumor is hard to differentiate from normal tissue, advanced imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be combined with CT to accurately determine tumor volume. As an example, in lung tumors adjacent to the chest wall or associated with lung atelectasis or consolidation, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> can help delineate targets more precisely.</p><p>Reducing high doses of incidental radiation outside the intended treatment volume is critical to preventing normal tissue toxicity with the high-dose fractions used in SBRT. Protocols commonly define criteria related to the conformality of target dose and compactness of intermediate dose. In addition, normal tissue dose constraints are being developed and modified based on existing data from patients treated with SBRT to help predict toxicity based on dose-volume relationships.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY NSCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection remains the standard therapy for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are surgical candidates. Five-year survival rates range from approximately 60 to 70 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage I and stage II non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Surgical candidates'</a>.)</p><p>However, SBRT is an alternative as primary treatment for patients who are not candidates for or who refuse surgery. The data supporting the use of SBRT in patients with stage I or II NSCLC and the data comparing SBRT with surgery are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H516535756\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage I and stage II non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LUNG METASTASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lungs are one of the most common sites of spread of disease for patients with a wide variety of primary tumors. Although this usually is a manifestation of widespread disease, carefully selected patients benefit from surgical resection of one or a limited number of lung metastases when this is the sole site of recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Benefits, indications, preoperative evaluation, and techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SBRT appears to be an effective and well tolerated local therapy for patients with limited metastatic disease within the lung. Local control rates in patients with lung metastases have ranged from 67 to 92 percent using various dose fractionation schemes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. These results suggest that SBRT provides equivalent local control to surgical resection; thus, SBRT may be an alternative to surgery in patients with oligometastatic disease.</p><p>The potential role of SBRT in patients with lung metastases is illustrated by two series: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-institution series of 121 patients with five or fewer lung metastases, the two-year and four-year local control rates following SBRT were 77 and 73 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A subsequent report based upon the same series observed that SBRT was used to retreat nine recurrent and 29 new lung lesions, which developed after the initial SBRT treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter phase <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> study of 38 patients, each with one to three enlarging pulmonary metastases, the SBRT dose was escalated from 48 to 60 Gy given divided into three fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. None of the 12 patients in the phase I portion of the study experienced a dose-limiting toxicity. In an analysis of the assessable 50 lesions, actuarial local control rates at one and two years were 100 and 96 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604603502\"><span class=\"h1\">REIRRADIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the conformal high doses given with SBRT, its use has extended to patients previously treated with thoracic radiation.</p><p>Multiple series and one small prospective trial have looked at using SBRT in the setting of local failure after prior fractionated radiation for early-stage or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Doses used have included 48 Gy in four fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] as well as dose ranges over 5 to 10 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-23</a>]. Reported local control rates have been encouraging, ranging from 60 to 95 percent, but levels of toxicity have also been higher than SBRT in previously untreated tumors, including higher percentage of fatal radiation-induced toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The increased risk of toxicity suggests that extreme caution should be taken in selection of these patients to avoid significant late toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604603509\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest with contrast are the preferred method of following both primary and metastatic lesions treated with SBRT. Follow-up CT scans are generally performed at intervals of three to six months, as was suggested in the clinical trial setting. Because of the fibrosis caused by hypofractionated radiation, changes seen on CT can often mimic disease progression and can be difficult to distinguish from radiation injury.</p><p>Careful communication with thoracic radiologists including knowledge of the potential effects of high-dose radiation is essential. Certain patterns of response to SBRT and subsequent CT changes correlating with radiation fibrosis are well described in the literature and can be used as guides when interpreting follow-up scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>When there is a suggestion of progressive disease after SBRT, correlation with other imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT,</span> is warranted and biopsy confirmation of relapse is recommended if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Because moderate residual metabolic uptake can often be seen up to 12 months after SBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in the absence of suspicious CT changes is not routinely recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the high doses per fraction used during SBRT, there is an increased risk of normal tissue toxicity compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy unless care is taken to minimize radiation exposure to normal structures. The numbers of patients and length of follow-up are limited in the studies described above. However, prospective assessment of dosimetric endpoints such as dose volume information has been used to modify SBRT dose constraints in normal tissues, and SBRT for thoracic lesions appears to have a reasonable safety profile.</p><p>The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has observed reasonable rates of toxicity for treatment of medically inoperable patients when the SBRT dose is divided into three fractions for peripheral tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Grade 3 to 4 toxicity was seen in 15 patients (28 percent) treated on RTOG 0236, and no treatment-related deaths were seen. Other studies have also observed that SBRT was well tolerated, and that changes in pulmonary function tests were minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447863826\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral and apical lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For lesions near the lung periphery, chest wall toxicity may be manifested by rib fractures or pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The incidence of chest wall toxicity was illustrated by a series of 347 treated lesions, which included 203 on the chest wall. Both chest wall pain and rib fractures were more frequent when chest wall lesions were irradiated compared with nonchest wall lesions (16 versus 3 percent and 8 versus 1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>When SBRT is used to treat primary lung cancers in apical sites, there may be an increased risk of injury to the brachial plexus. In a series of 36 patients with apical lesions treated with SBRT to a median dose of 57 Gy in three fractions, seven patients developed grade 2, 3, or 4 brachial plexopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These authors felt that the tolerance of the major trunks of the brachial plexus was around 26 Gy for a three-fraction regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Neoplastic and radiation-induced brachial plexopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447863780\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SBRT appears to offer a reasonable alternative for patients with proximal lesions, although its safety may require some modification of the SBRT fractionation schedule.</p><p>The phase II study conducted at Indiana University, which included 70 patients with medically inoperable central lung cancers, found that central and perihilar structures within the lung are very sensitive to the high doses of radiation delivered during SBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Low-grade toxicities included fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and radiation pneumonitis. Fourteen patients had severe toxicity, including decline in pulmonary function tests, pleural effusions, and pneumonias. There were six deaths that may have been treatment-related, the majority of which were from pneumonia. Four of the six deaths were in patients with central tumors, and these patients had an 11-fold increased risk of having a severe toxicity compared with patients with peripheral lesions. </p><p>A systematic review of the literature, based primarily upon retrospective case series, included data from 315 patients with central early-stage non-small cell lung cancer in 20 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This review concluded that local control could be achieved as effectively as with peripheral lesions, with an acceptable level of toxicity, provided that an adequate dose of radiation to the periphery of the tumor was maintained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447863773\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When SBRT is used to treat patients with lung metastases, toxicity is typically less severe than that for those with primary lung cancer. These patients tend to present with better overall lung function and are more likely to have peripherally located tumors. In the multicenter dose-escalation study, no grade 4 to 5 toxicity was seen, and there were no treatment-related deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although multiple patients had more than one lesion treated with SBRT, only three had grade 3 toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a radiation therapy technique that utilizes precisely targeted radiation to a tumor while minimizing radiation to adjacent normal tissue. This targeting allows treatment of small- or moderate-sized tumors in either a single or limited number of dose fractions. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Techniques for lung tumors'</a> above.)</p><p>Application of SBRT techniques in patients with small primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) or lung metastases has given results similar to surgical resection, although long-term follow-up data are not available. There are no results from randomized clinical trials comparing SBRT with surgery or other ablative techniques such as radiofrequency ablation.
