Pain-related expenditures (direct costs and lost wages) in the United States exceed those for cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The use and misuse of opioids for management of chronic pain is a major concern, with problems arising from their multiple adverse side effects including drug dependency, from drug diversion, and from under-treatment of chronic pain symptoms for fear of opioid abuse. Chronic pain is thus a major medical and social issue, affecting the quality of life of individual patients, their friends and families, the work force, and society in general.</p><p>A comprehensive pain evaluation is essential to developing an effective plan for treatment. Although there are unique aspects to every individual's pain complaints, there are many common elements to the pain evaluation, irrespective of the pain complaint. An appropriate history and physical examination are vital to a proper evaluation. Laboratory studies, imaging, and other diagnostic testing may be appropriate in selected situations.</p><p>The evaluation of patients complaining of persistent pain is discussed here. The classification of chronic pain and overview of its treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544395\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES OF CHRONIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms to the primary care clinician, only a percentage of patients ultimately develop a chronic pain syndrome. In a study based on a survey of representative population in the United States from 1999 to 2002 (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES), chronic pain (defined as &gt;three months of pain) was reported as follows: back pain 10.1 percent, <span class=\"nowrap\">leg/foot</span> pain 7.1 percent, <span class=\"nowrap\">arm/hand</span> pain 4.1 percent, headache 3.5 percent, chronic regional pain 11.1 percent, widespread pain 3.6 percent; the majority of patients who reported chronic pain reported more than one type of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Chronic pain can be considered to be in one of four categories. Identifying which of these categories the patient falls into is helpful in designing an appropriate treatment plan, although multifactorial causes of chronic pain are not uncommon. These pain categories can be considered to be [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathic pain (either peripheral, including post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy; or central, including post-stroke pain or multiple sclerosis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal pain (eg, back pain, myofascial pain syndrome, ankle pain)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory pain (eg, inflammatory arthropathies, infection)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Mechanical/compressive</span> pain (eg, renal calculi, visceral pain from expanding tumor masses)</p><p/><p>Note that these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive, since back pain might be considered both musculoskeletal and <span class=\"nowrap\">mechanical/compressive</span> if it results from nerve root compression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544409\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history is crucial to the evaluation of the patient with chronic pain. Pain assessment should be a routine part of any medical encounter and has been referred to as the &ldquo;fifth vital sign&rdquo; in both hospital and ambulatory settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Familiarity with the patient and input from families, friends, and support systems will aid in assessing the true impact of pain on the patient's life and in determining reasonable goals. It is also helpful to inquire about the patient's perception of why they have persistent pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544416\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should review all components of a usual medical history, in addition to specific pain-related items. The patient should be asked a detailed history related to the circumstances surrounding the onset of pain (if known) and potential mechanisms of injury. Open-ended questions, at least initially, should be used to ascertain the nature of the pain. Descriptors (such as sharp, dull, squeezing, throbbing, colicky) can be offered if the patient cannot fully describe their symptoms.</p><p>Important symptom-related factors to be determined are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain location</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Characteristics/quality</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporal aspects: duration, onset, changes since onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constancy or intermittency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristics of any breakthrough pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Exacerbating/triggering</span> factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Palliative/relieving</span> factors</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544423\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other symptoms that may be associated with the patient's pain should be questioned:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restriction of range of motion, stiffness, or swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle aches, cramps, or spasms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color or temperature changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in skin, hair, or nail growth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in muscle strength</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in sensation, either positive <span class=\"nowrap\">(dysesthesias/itching)</span> or negative (numbness)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544430\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be questioned about the impact of pain on function (social and physical) and overall quality of life. Specific questions to ask include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Social and recreational functioning</strong>: How often do you participate in pleasurable activities, such as hobbies, going out to movies or concerts, socializing with friends, and travel? Over the past week, how often has pain interfered with these activities?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mood, affect, and anxiety</strong>: Has pain interfered with your energy, mood, or personality?

When was the last time you worked, and (if applicable) why have you stopped working?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep</strong>: Does pain interfere with your sleep? How often over the past week?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise</strong>: How often do you do some sort of exercise? Over the past week, how often has pain interfered with your ability to exercise?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544437\"><span class=\"h3\">Activities of daily living</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of pain on basic activities of daily living (ADLs) should be assessed, addressing the patient's ability to bathe, dress, go to the toilet, and feed without help. Questions also should be asked about activities required to live independently (instrumental activities of daily living or IADLs), including the ability to shop, use transportation, prepare meals, do housework, manage finances and medications.</p><p>Specific questions which, in conjunction with a physical examination, may help to document a patient's function include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient able to perform activities of daily living?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Can they brush their teeth, comb their hair, or bathe?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Can they manage using the toilet and cleaning without assistance?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Can they feed themselves?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient ambulatory?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do they need an assist-device (eg, cane, brace, walker, crutch)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has their ambulation changed since the pain started?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How far can the patient ambulate?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How fast can they walk (eg, how long does it take the patient to get from the parking lot to your office, compared to your own time?)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient able to dress independently?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Able to put <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own shoes and socks on?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Can the patient put a shirt on himself?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the patient wears a bra, is she able to put it on by herself?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient able to manage household chores, including shopping, cooking, bill paying?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the patient able to drive a car?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Can the patient get in and out of a car with relative ease?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the patient able to get up and down from sitting on a chair or toilet?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544444\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain intensity scales</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain intensity can only be determined by the patient's report. Measures of pain intensity are not meant to compare one person's pain with another's. Pain scales are reliable only to compare the intensity of one patient's pain at different times, thus allowing clinicians and patients to judge whether pain intensity is increasing or decreasing with time and treatment.</p><p>A number of different measurements for pain intensity have been developed, and no scale is clearly better than another. Most scales in common use are unidimensional. Some patients have greater ease with a verbal scale, others with a numerical rating scale (NRS) or a visual analog scale (VAS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346 \">figure 1</a>). The NRS-11 (a number scale from 0 to 10) is perhaps the most commonly used pain intensity rating tool. A verbal scale offers descriptors, such as &quot;no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, unbearable pain&quot; that can be graded on each visit. Pain maps (body maps) can be useful for patients who have difficulty with verbal expression. A front and rear view of the body is presented on paper, and the patient is asked to pencil in the location of the pain. Asking the patient to map out the distribution of pain on their own body also may be helpful.</p><p>A consistent measure of pain for an individual patient should be used across time. Patients should be asked to rate both pain present at the time of visit, and pain experienced over the past week.</p><p>Multidimensional instruments provide more information than unidimensional scales, but take longer to administer. Since chronic pain affects a person&rsquo;s whole life, many experts feel that it is essential to use multidimensional instruments for appropriate assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a short, &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo; self-administered, practical questionnaire that is in many languages and has been validated for cancer pain and noncancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The BPI assesses pain location, intensity, and pattern as well as patient beliefs and the impact of pain on the patient&rsquo;s quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The revised version of the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) includes a selection of descriptive words to characterize qualities of pain, a pain intensity scale, a questionnaire on the use of analgesic medications and prior pain experience, and a human figure drawing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Specific words selected to characterize the pain quality may suggest a particular pathophysiology (eg, burning, dysesthetic, or electric-shock-like pain may imply neuropathic pain).</p><p/><p>Specific instruments have been developed for the evaluation of neuropathic pain, and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Neuropathic Pain Scale, administered verbally, with established predictive validity that assesses different qualities of neuropathic pain and can be used to follow treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The S-LANSS score (8-Bennett 05) - A self-support version of the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS), consisting of five self-reported items and two patient-assessed sensory testing items (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62906\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62906 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DN4 - A clinician-administered tool with 10 items based on history and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], has a cut-off value of <span class=\"nowrap\">4/10</span> for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain (positive item score = 1, negative items score = 0). The DN4 has a positive predictive value of 86 percent, sensitivity of 82.9 percent, and a specificity of 89.9 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74662 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544451\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous evaluation and/or treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior evaluation and treatment for pain should be explored.

Of particular concern is history related to underlying psychological disorders (eg, depression, anxiety) or a history of substance abuse, including prescription drugs.</p><p>A patient's specific beliefs about their pain and their prior healthcare experiences should be understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is crucial to determine the patient's expectations for treatment and to educate and counsel patients with respect to how realistic these expectations and goals are. A significant mismatch or gap between expectations and reality will lead inevitably to frustration for both patient and clinician.</p><p>Questions to be asked include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the patient's perception of why they have persistent pain?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient believe an adequate diagnostic work-up has been done?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have expectations for specific types of treatments?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the patient's expectations or goals of treatment (eg, extent of pain relief and functional improvement)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How involved does the patient expect to be in their treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544465\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete physical examination, including a detailed neurologic assessment, should be performed, regardless of the patient's area of complaint.

The patient's general appearance, dress, and hygiene should be noted.</p><p>Compensatory movements, or splinting, may serve to protect a painful region of the body, and consistency of such activities should be observed. Suggestions of pain embellishment should be noted, but do not necessarily indicate malingering since patients with longstanding chronic pain may enhance their presenting symptoms to assure themselves that the clinician will accept and explore their complaints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544479\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is a subjective complaint and cannot be assessed with laboratory studies. However, appropriate laboratory, imaging, and other testing can be helpful to evaluate or follow certain painful conditions. It should be borne in mind, however, that finding an abnormality in a diagnostic test does not confirm that this is the source of the patient&rsquo;s pain syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544486\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&ldquo;Routine&rdquo; blood studies are not indicated, but directed testing should be ordered when specific causes of pain (ie, rheumatologic, infectious, or oncologic) are suggested by the patient's history or physical examination. Serologic markers of inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein should be normal in degenerative or neuropathic causes of pain but may be elevated in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, or infectious processes (eg, septic discitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544493\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is likely that patients with chronic pain complaints will already have had diagnostic imaging studies from previous evaluations, and these should be obtained and reviewed if possible, to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure and expense.</p><p>Indications for imaging and other studies will vary depending on the location of the patient's pain and are discussed in multiple other topics in UpToDate.

This report identified limitations in the training of generalist clinicians in the management of chronic pain, noting that it is not realistic or desirable that pain management be delegated exclusively to pain specialists. To support generalist clinicians in the management of their patients with chronic pain, issues related to training, education, and reimbursement need to be addressed.</p><p>While many patients with chronic pain can be managed without specialty referral, patients may require referral to a pain specialist for one of several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that are debilitating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms located at multiple sites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that do not respond to initial therapies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Escalating need for pain medication</p><p/><p>When to refer to a pain specialist remains a controversial question; referral should certainly occur by the time significant disability or loss of functioning are observed or when pain behaviors have coalesced or maladaptive coping strategies have begun to emerge. Most pain specialists feel that referrals are frequently made too late in the course of pain, when patients are beyond &quot;the golden hour.&quot; This is especially true of neuropathic forms of pain and cancer pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544514\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant portion of patients presenting with chronic pain also have histories of primary psychiatric comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The inclusion of Axis I <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> II diagnoses in the patient's history should never provide the grounds to dismiss the patient's complaints of pain.</p><p>Nociceptive pathways are modulated by psychological processes, which probably play an important role in amplifying pain symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and other psychiatric disorders can present formidable obstacles to diagnosing and treating many pain syndromes. In one prospective study, patients with a mental health diagnosis were twice as likely to be prescribed an opioid medication three years later than those without a psychiatric diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Patients with longstanding or complex pain problems should be treated with a multidisciplinary approach that includes an evaluation and close collaboration by a mental health professional who can diagnose and treat the psychologic aspects of the dysfunction.</p><p>It is important to distinguish patients with underlying psychiatric illness from those whose psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, or other expressions of psychopathology) arise secondary to their pain. Chronic pain can take an emotional toll, affecting relationships with loved ones, friends, and potentially employers. Besides living with pain, the patient may feel angry, isolated, helpless, and fearful that he or she has lost the ability to engage in productive employment, or be a good spouse, parent, or friend. Somatoform pain disorder, in which pain is not fully explained by a general medical condition, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis#H3788678462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Terminology and DSM-5'</a>.)</p><p>Depression and anxiety, two of the most common psychological correlates of chronic pain, complicate the patient's conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, lack of energy, and diminished physical activity contribute to an increasingly debilitated state and amplify the patient's pain symptoms. Patients commonly describe a lack of pleasure and an absence of control in their lives.</p><p>A number of instruments or psychological tests are widely employed to screen the psychological profiles of chronic pain patients. Two that are in common use are the Beck Depression Inventory and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory II (MMPI-2). The former is a brief, 21-item, self-reporting questionnaire that assesses the degree to which depressive symptomatology is present. The latter is an extensive <span class=\"nowrap\">true/false</span> questionnaire consisting of more than 500 items factored across 10 clinical scales, as well as a variety of validity, secondary, and experimental scales. The MMPI-2 has been used extensively to verify clinical impressions about the psychological aspects of a patient's chronic pain and to predict responses to medical and surgical pain treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544523\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful pain management in the older adult, as with younger individuals, is predicated on a comprehensive pain assessment. Specific goals include determining the type and cause of pain; identifying exacerbating co-morbidities; reviewing beliefs, attitudes, and expectations regarding pain; and gathering information that would assist and impact an individualized treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Self-report of pain is the most reliable source for the cognitively intact and communicative older adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, older patients may have more difficulty in communicating their pain, and are often undertreated for pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Deficits in vision, hearing and cognition are common in this population and need to be identified prior to beginning the interview. Adjustments to accommodate for deficits that may compromise the assessment need to be considered, especially when selecting appropriate pain assessment instruments. It also may be beneficial to query other family members or caregivers for corroboration and additional perspective on medical history, predominant mood and affect, and physical and social functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>For a variety of reasons, older adults may be more hesitant than younger individuals to report pain. Some &ldquo;barriers&rdquo; to discussing pain include: perception that pain simply is a concomitant of aging; reluctance to &ldquo;bother&rdquo; their clinician with complaints of pain; not wanting to detract the clinician&rsquo;s attention away from other &ldquo;medical&rdquo; complaints. Older adults also may use different descriptive terms for their pain (aching, soreness, hurting, discomfort), including some that are not included in commonly used pain instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544530\"><span class=\"h3\">Medication history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful medication history must include all current and past medications, doses, side effects, and response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Many older individuals living in the community cannot accurately provide this information. It is helpful to ask that they bring in all current medications, as well as to obtain corroborative information from other treating clinicians and from relatives and to obtain the name and phone number of the patient's current pharmacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be specifically questioned about use of herbal and dietary supplements, as well as over the counter medications, in addition to prescription medications. Data from 2002 indicate that approximately one-quarter of older women in the US regularly use an herbal or dietary supplement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Additionally, patients should be asked about alcohol use, with specific inquiry regarding type, frequency and amount. Tobacco products and illicit drug use are important elements of inquiry as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544537\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognition is grossly assessed during the process of the health interview. More detailed assessment may be indicated for patients who seem to have cognitive impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544544\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychosocial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mood, social support systems, recreational involvement, and financial resources are important to the psychosocial assessment. These factors influence how the patient experiences the pain and how the patients may respond to various treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544551\"><span class=\"h3\">Beliefs and attitudes about pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The context in which older adults perceive pain is relevant to the overall assessment. Older adults are more likely to view severe discomfort as a sign of serious or life-threatening illness (eg, recurrence of cancer). Pain can signify loss of independence, debilitating illness, or may be regarded as a natural consequence of the aging process and therefore be underreported.</p><p>Identifying coping skills among the elderly is important so that the clinician can encourage the use of previously successful skills or modify treatment interventions to promote effective coping skills. The most consistent findings in studies is that older persons use prayer and hope as pain coping mechanisms to a greater extent than do younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15544558\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term care facilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have identified problems with pain assessment in the nursing home setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults/abstract/21,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,32,33</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H15544395\" class=\"local\">'Common causes of chronic pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough history for pain evaluation should include inquiry into pain characteristics, impact of pain on the quality of life, and usual activities. Pain intensity scales cannot compare pain severity between patients but can evaluate changes over time in one patient's pain syndrome. Important components of the history are the patient's previous medical experience for pain and their expectations for pain relief. (See <a href=\"#H15544409\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination should include a complete examination, regardless of the area of pain. Relevant findings include the clinician's observation of the patient's ability to move and general appearance. (See <a href=\"#H15544465\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is a subjective complaint and cannot be assessed with laboratory studies. Diagnostic testing will depend on the patient's particular pain and prior evaluation. Interventional testing such as nerve conduction studies and electromyography may not detect focal nerve lesions involving only small nerve fibers. Multiple questionnaires have been developed to assess neuropathic pain and follow treatment response. (See <a href=\"#H15544507\" class=\"local\">'Referral to a pain specialist'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15544479\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal timing for a referral to a pain specialty clinic is uncertain, but earlier referral for patients whose pain is debilitating or who are exhibiting maladaptive coping strategies is preferable.
