As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is often refractory to standard treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms: Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with MDS die because of the consequences of bone marrow failure rather than transformation to AML. Thus, use of terms such as &quot;pre-leukemia&quot; or &quot;smoldering leukemia&quot; can be misleading, if taken to imply that death or morbidity from MDS results only when AML develops. Indeed, the distinction between MDS and AML is itself arbitrary, as the World Health Organization (WHO) classification describes patients with &lt;20 percent bone marrow blasts as having MDS, while those with &ge;20 percent blasts are considered to have AML. </p><p>For many years, transfusion with packed red blood cells and platelets and the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were the only therapy available. More recently, chemotherapy agents directed at the underlying disorder have been developed and continue to be studied for patients with MDS (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>). However, due to the advanced age of most patients, the chronicity of the disease, and its attendant morbidities, supportive care remains a central component of the management of all patients with MDS. Patients should be treated as needed with antibiotics for infection and platelet transfusions for bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. </p><p>This topic will review the major complications of MDS and the role of supportive care in its management. The diagnosis of MDS, the prognosis of MDS, and the treatment of the underlying disorder are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intermediate, low, or very low risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults#H2102505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes in adults&quot;, section on 'Other prognostic features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytogenetics and molecular genetics of myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7193969\"><span class=\"h1\">ANEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MDS typically present with a normocytic or macrocytic anemia that can vary in severity. At least 80 percent of patients are anemic at the time of diagnosis, while about 50 percent have a hemoglobin level less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Anemia can manifest as fatigue, weakness, exercise intolerance, angina, dizziness, cognitive impairment, or an altered sense of wellbeing. The degree of anemia is also a prognostic marker in patients with MDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults#H861596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes in adults&quot;, section on 'WHO prognostic scoring system (WPSS)'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with anemia should be evaluated for other causes of anemia including gastrointestinal blood loss, hemolysis, renal insufficiency, and nutritional deficiencies. An initial evaluation should include a drug exposure history, review of the peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, an investigation for occult blood loss, renal insufficiency, and measurement of iron, folate, and vitamin B12 levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Causes of anemia'</a>.)</p><p>The anemia of MDS is primarily managed with red cell transfusions. However, chronic transfusional support may lead to iron overload and secondary hemochromatosis. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) may decrease or minimize the need for red cell transfusions in patients with low or intermediate-risk disease, as calculated by the IPSS score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-myelodysplastic-syndrome-international-prognostic-scoring-system-original-ipss-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), who demonstrate a low serum erythropoietin level (&le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/ml)</span> and low transfusion requirements (&lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/month)</span>. Although patients with MDS have normal or elevated iron stores, red cell transfusions increase iron stores and therefore increase serum ferritin levels. As discussed below, high ferritin levels often prompt administration of iron chelators, although whether this practice improves survival is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H2104230\" class=\"local\">'Iron overload'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7195992\" class=\"local\">'Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7195483\"><span class=\"h2\">Red cell transfusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term red cell transfusion support is the primary management option for anemia in MDS. The threshold for transfusion of packed red blood cells varies with patient age, symptoms, and the presence of medical comorbidities. In general, most centers recommend transfusion to asymptomatic patients with a hemoglobin &le;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/liter)</span>. </p><p>In order to diminish complications due to the presence of leukocytes within the transfusions (eg, platelet isosensitization, cytomegalovirus and other viral infections, febrile transfusion reactions, and immunosuppression), the use of prestorage leukoreduced transfusion products is encouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Although graft-versus-host disease is very unusual in patients with MDS receiving transfusions, many centers routinely irradiate blood products for such patients. The administration of cytomegalovirus negative, irradiated blood products is of special importance for patients who are candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H1539011\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Ambulatory patient'</a>.)</p><p>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are almost universally successful in raising hemoglobin levels. Transfusions can often ameliorate the patient's symptoms rapidly and improve health-related quality of life. Exceptions include patients unable to be transfused because of the presence of multiple alloantibodies and those who refuse transfusions based on religious beliefs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to the patient who refuses blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion#H646633\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;, section on 'Patient with multiple alloantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>The use of RBC transfusions to treat anemia is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7195992\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ESAs for the treatment of symptomatic anemia in patients with MDS is an unlabeled or investigational use according to the US Food and Drug Administration. However, their use in MDS is supported by the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>ESAs (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoetin alfa</a> or darbepoetin), administered alone or in combination with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), may decrease or minimize the need for red cell transfusions in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS, as calculated by the IPSS score. Patients with lower endogenous serum erythropoietin levels and a lower red cell transfusion requirement are more likely to respond to ESAs. (See <a href=\"#H7196544\" class=\"local\">'Adding G-CSF for non-responders'</a> below.) </p><p>We suggest that symptomatic anemic patients with low serum erythropoietin levels (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL),</span> particularly those with low transfusion requirements (&lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/month)</span> and a low or intermediate-1 risk IPSS score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-myelodysplastic-syndrome-international-prognostic-scoring-system-original-ipss-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) be treated with synthetic erythropoietin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoetin alfa</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darbepoetin alfa</a>). G-CSF may be added if treatment with epoetin alfa is unsuccessful after three months in a patient with severe anemia or after six months if the anemia is less severe. Our decision to use epoetin alfa alone rather than combination therapy is principally based upon the lack of evidence that combination therapy is superior to high dose epoetin alfa, the high cost of combination therapy, and the added toxicity (ie, bone pain and fevers) when G-CSF is administered. However, given the relatively high expense of these drugs at the doses employed and the unknown effects on quality of life, red cell transfusion therapy remains an acceptable alternative.</p><p>Patients with low- or intermediate-1 risk MDS are an <strong>exception</strong> to the general recommendation from ASH and ASCO to avoid ESAs for the treatment of anemia associated with malignancy in patients who are not receiving concurrent myelosuppressive chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As with any clinical intervention, use of ESAs must be based upon the <span class=\"nowrap\">benefit/risk</span> ratio in a given patient. While the risk of shortened survival following use of ESAs has been seen with other cancers, the same has not been found with MDS. However, it is plausible that ESAs may shorten survival in MDS, particularly in patients with characteristics associated with a relatively long natural history (ie, low or intermediate-1 IPSS).

While some studies have demonstrated improvements in quality of life, ESAs have not been shown to improve overall survival rates. Both epoetin alfa and darbepoetin appear to be equivalent with regard to efficacy and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Randomized and nonrandomized prospective trials of ESAs in patients with MDS have substantiated this thesis by demonstrating improved erythroid response in patients given combination therapy with G-CSF and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoetin alfa</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/9,15,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,24-28</a>].

Chronic transfusional support may lead to iron overload and secondary hemochromatosis, with the potential for long-term hepatic, pancreatic, gonadal, and cardiac complications. As such, a number of guidelines suggest the use of iron chelating agents in patients with MDS and iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. However, the relationship between red cell transfusions and shorter survival in MDS may have little to do with the iron overload per se, and the benefit of iron chelation in MDS is unproven at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. We reserve the use of iron chelation treatment in patients with lower risk MDS who have had, or are anticipated to have, prolonged red cell transfusion requirements (eg, more than 20 to 30 transfusions) and demonstrate evidence of iron overload (eg, serum ferritin &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>. More sensitive and specific tests to assess clinically significant iron overload (eg, MRI scans of the heart <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver) may help to identify patients who may benefit from iron chelation therapy in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].

Indirect support for the use of iron chelation therapy to prevent secondary hemochromatosis comes from studies in other hematologic conditions. Randomized studies in beta thalassemia major have demonstrated that long-term iron chelation reverses iron-related organ damage, reduces morbidity, and prolongs survival. However, only data from nonrandomized studies are available to support the use of iron chelation in MDS at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/41,49-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,49-55</a>]. It is unknown whether iron chelation would be helpful in reducing other complications of MDS, such as infection, morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic cell transplantation, or transformation to acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferasirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferasirox</a> in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk disease and transfusional iron overload is underway, which may answer most of these questions. </p><p>In addition, issues regarding the safety of iron chelation in the setting of MDS have been raised. The US Food and Drug Administration has indicated that treatment with the orally-active iron chelator <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferasirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferasirox</a> may be associated with an increased number of adverse events, such as renal injury, and deaths in patients with MDS over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/32,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,57</a>]. A prospective multicenter trial evaluated the safety of deferasirox in 176 adults (median age 71 years) with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS who had received &ge;20 units of red cells (median 41 units), had a serum ferritin &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (median 2771 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> and had ongoing red cell transfusion requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Forty-five percent of patients discontinued deferasirox within the first year; 80 percent discontinued within the first three years.

We typically perform an MRI of the heart <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver to further assess iron status prior to initiating iron chelation in this population. While such studies are expensive, they appear to be more sensitive than serum ferritin in predicting the development of complications from iron overload.
