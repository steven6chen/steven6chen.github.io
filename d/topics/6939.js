It is the final step in liberating a patient from mechanical ventilation. Issues that need to be considered prior to extubation, the extubation procedure itself, and management after extubation are described here. Outcomes following extubation are also discussed. Predictors of weaning success and methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIOR TO EXTUBATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the end of the weaning process, it may be apparent that a patient no longer requires mechanical ventilation to maintain sufficient ventilation and oxygenation. However, extubation should not be ordered until it has been determined that the patient is able to protect the airway and the airway is patent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway protection is the ability to guard against aspiration during spontaneous breathing. It requires sufficient cough strength and an adequate level of consciousness, each of which should be assessed prior to extubation. The amount of secretions should also be considered prior to extubation because airway protection is significantly more difficult when secretions are increased.</p><p>Extubation failure is highest when a combination of risk factors is present. As an example, when reduced cough peak expiratory flow rate (&le;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min),</span> increased sputum volume (&gt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour),</span> and impaired neurologic function (inability to follow commands) are present, the incidence of extubation failure was 100 percent, compared to 3 percent when none of the risk factors were present (relative risk 23, 95% CI 3.2-167) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Universally accepted threshold levels of cough strength, level of consciousness, and suctioning frequency that prohibit extubation have not been established. For many patients, it seems reasonable to delay extubation if the cough strength is weak, the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is &lt;8, or suctioning is required more frequently than every two to three hours. However, the final decision to delay or proceed with extubation should be made on a case-by-case basis since delayed extubation is associated with adverse outcomes, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and increased length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23549634\"><span class=\"h3\">Cough strength</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of cough strength and the amount of secretions was illustrated by several observational studies reporting that successful extubation directly correlated with strength of the spontaneous cough and inversely correlated with the frequency of suctioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study of 130 patients who had passed a spontaneous breathing trial demonstrated that extubation failure was more likely among patients who were unable to cough on command or who had a peak expiratory flow rate during a cough of &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> (24 versus 3.5 percent, relative risk 6.9, 95% CI 2.0-24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another observational study enrolled 88 patients who had passed a spontaneous breathing trial and were being considered for extubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Extubation failure occurred in 14 patients (16 percent). Patients were more likely to fail extubation if their peak expiratory flow during a cough was &le;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> (relative risk 4.8, 95% CI 1.4-16.2) or their secretions were &gt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> (relative risk 3.0, 95% CI 1.0-8.8). The study was limited by its small sample size, leading to imprecise estimates of the magnitude of effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective observational study examined predictors of extubation failure in 225 patients who were mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours. Ineffective cough was the strongest predictor of extubation failure and requirement for re-intubation within the next seven days (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.03, 95% CI 1.80-14.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additional risk factors included abundant secretions (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.21-9.13) and duration of mechanical ventilation greater than seven days (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.11-7.41). This study was limited by the use of semi objective measures of cough strength and secretion volume. </p><p/><p>Several methods have been described that can be used in intubated patients to help determine whether the cough strength is sufficient to clear secretions following extubation. Two of the methods require cooperative patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A spirometer is inserted into the ventilator circuit and the patient is then instructed to cough. The peak expiratory flow (PEF) during the cough is measured. Patients with a PEF &le;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> are five times more likely to require reintubation than patients with a PEF &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endotracheal tube (ETT) is detached from the ventilator circuit and a card (eg, an index card) is held approximately 1 to 2 cm from the proximal end of the ETT. The patient is then instructed to cough. A patient who is unable to moisten the card with 3 to 4 coughs is three times more likely to fail extubation than a patient who can moisten the card [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23549646\"><span class=\"h3\">Mental state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of level of consciousness has also been demonstrated in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 100 neurosurgical patients, patients with a GCS &ge;8 were significantly more likely to undergo successful extubation than patients with a GCS &lt;8 (75 versus 37 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the observational study of 88 patients cited above, the inability to complete four commands (open eyes, follow object with eyes, grasp hand, stick out tongue) was associated with an increased risk of extubation failure (relative risk 4.3, 95% CI 1.8-10.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Sedation frequently reduces consciousness and may therefore influence the ability of a patient to be successfully extubated. One systematic review of six observational studies reported no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation or mortality when sedation protocols were used in ICUs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, some randomized trials examining the effect of daily interruption of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients have suggested benefit in reducing days on mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. These studies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Avoid excess sedation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway patency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications related to the ETT can affect airway patency and may not be detectable until after extubation when patients present with postextubation stridor that may require reintubation. Postextubation stridor occurs in less than 10 percent of unselected critically ill patients and is associated with increased rates of reintubation, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer length of ICU stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Testing for a cuff leak prior to extubation is the most common method used to determine whether airway patency may be decreased. Since the cuff leak test is neither sensitive nor specific in unselected patients, most experts only use the cuff leak test in those considered at high risk for postextubation stridor from laryngeal edema. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1342818796\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for postextubation laryngeal edema include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/14-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged intubation (variably defined as &ge;36 hours to &ge;6 days)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age greater than 80 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large endotracheal tube (&gt;8 mm in men, &gt;7 mm in women)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A ratio of ETT to laryngeal diameter greater than 45 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small ratio of patient height to ETT diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A GCS score &lt;8, traumatic intubation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive tube mobility due to insufficient fixation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient or lack of sedation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspiration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of an orogastric or nasogastric tube &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cuff leak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A &quot;cuff leak&quot; refers to normal airflow around the ETT after the cuff of the ETT is deflated. Its absence suggests there is reduced space between the ETT and the larynx. This may be due to laryngeal edema, another laryngeal injury, secretions, or a large ETT within a relatively small larynx. Patients without a cuff leak are at increased risk for post-extubation stridor. While not routinely recommended in all mechanically ventilated patients, many experts only perform the cuff leak test in those assessed to be at high risk for postextubation stridor. (See <a href=\"#H1342818796\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The cuff leak can be detected qualitatively or quantitatively:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Qualitative assessment is performed by deflating the cuff and then listening for air movement around the ETT using a stethoscope placed over the upper trachea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative assessment is performed by deflating the ETT cuff and measuring the difference between the inspired and expired tidal volumes of ventilator-delivered breaths during volume-cycled mechanical ventilation. The lowest three expired tidal volumes obtained over six breaths are averaged and then subtracted from the inspired tidal volume to give the cuff leak volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Cuff leak volumes less than 110 mL or less than 12 to 24 percent of the delivered tidal volume have been suggested as thresholds for determining whether airway patency may be diminished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/15,17,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,21-24</a>].</p><p/><p>Simultaneous assessment of both cough and cuff leak may improve prediction of post-extubation stridor. After the cuff is deflated, the ETT is occluded and the patient is instructed to cough. The absence of both an audible cough and a cuff leak indicates the patient is 10 times more likely to develop post-extubation stridor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The absence of a cuff leak alone is an imperfect predictor of post-extubation stridor. The cuff leak predicts post-extubation stridor with a sensitivity of 15 to 85 percent and a specificity of 70 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/13,15,16,21-23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16,21-23,25,26</a>]. These wide ranges likely reflect variability in the patient populations, how the cuff leak was measured, and what was considered an acceptable cuff leak. A pooled analysis found a sensitivity and specificity of 56 and 92 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another meta-analysis of 14 observational studies estimated that the cuff leak test resulted in reduced rates of reintubation (2.4 versus 4.2 percent) and postextubation stridor (4 versus 7 percent) but at the expense of delayed extubation (9 percent absolute increase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Many patients are safely extubated despite an absent cuff leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Generally speaking, it is reasonable to proceed with extubation if a cuff leak exists, but to delay extubation if a cuff leak is reduced and there are risk factors for laryngeal edema (eg, prolonged intubation). Extubation should be considered on an individual basis in patients who have an absent cuff leak, but no risk factors for laryngeal edema and otherwise appear ready for extubation. Risk factors for laryngeal injury are described separately.

Although promising, this modality is not recommended for routine use until controlled clinical trials are performed.</p><p>For patients whose initial trial of extubation failed due to stridor and who are now being considered for extubation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a cuff leak is detected, bedside extubation is generally safe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a cuff leak is absent despite a course of glucocorticoid therapy, extubation over an airway exchange catheter (ie, a Cook catheter) may facilitate successful reintubation without delay, if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Extubation of such patients in a controlled environment, such as the operating room, should also be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and others limit glucocorticoid therapy to those patients who have a reduced cuff leak who are assessed to be at high risk of postextubation stridor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/9,10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,27</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Airway patency'</a> above) since the overall incidence of postextubation laryngeal edema requiring reintubation is low (less than 5 percent). We believe this approach focuses therapy on those who are most likely to benefit and avoids unnecessarily prolonging mechanical ventilation for glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p>There are conflicting data about the efficacy of glucocorticoids at preventing post-extubation stridor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/17,18,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,33-36</a>].

Meta-analyses further support the notion that glucocorticoids given prior to extubation reduce the rate of post-extubation stridor and reintubation when given in multiple doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/35,36,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36,39,40</a>] or when given to properly selected high risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/10,27,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27,40,41</a>]. Another meta-analysis of three randomized trials reported that in patients who failed a cuff leak test, glucocorticoid administration resulted in reduced rates of reintubation (6 versus 17 percent) and postextubation stridor (11 versus 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, trials that enrolled unselected patients and administered a single dose of glucocorticoids shortly prior to extubation did not find statistically significant improvement in the rates of post-extubation stridor and reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p>We believe that the risk for post-extubation stridor is more important than the number of doses administered when deciding whether giving glucocorticoids prior to extubation may be beneficial. This is supported by a trial that randomly assigned 71 patients with a cuff leak of less than 24 percent of the tidal volume administered by the ventilator to receive either a saline placebo or a single dose of 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> four hours prior to extubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The group that received the methylprednisolone had significantly decreased rates of post-extubation stridor (16 versus 39 percent) and reintubation (8 versus 30 percent) than the group that received the placebo.</p><p>We suggest that patients who have a reduced cuff leak receive a short course of glucocorticoid therapy before extubation (four hours or more). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylprednisolone</a> (20 mg) administered every four hours for a total of four doses prior to extubation is an acceptable regimen. Alternatively, a single dose of 40 mg of methylprednisolone administered four hours prior to extubation may be used. Choosing one over the other should be at the discretion of the physician and depends upon the assessed risk of postextubation stridor in a given patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTUBATION PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed into an upright position and both the oral cavity and the endotracheal tube (ETT) are suctioned. Instructions are given for the patient to take a deep breath and then exhale. During exhalation, the cuff is deflated and the ETT is removed in a single, smooth motion. Orogastric tubes are typically removed simultaneously.</p><p>Following extubation, the oral cavity is again suctioned and supplemental oxygen is administered by facemask. The oxyhemoglobin saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are monitored throughout the extubation process. Patients with increased secretions may require more frequent or nasotracheal suctioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2472470421\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF EXTUBATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing for extubation, (daytime [7 am to 6:59 pm] versus nighttime hours [7 pm to 6:59 am]) is unknown. Our practice is to extubate patients once successful weaning and extubation parameters have been met, provided that appropriate personnel are available. In general, this occurs during daytime hours. However, while not absolutely contraindicated, clinicians may perform after hours extubation among selected individuals in whom the risk of reintubation is assessed to be low (eg, patients undergoing terminal extubation, postoperative patients at low risk of reintubation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prior to extubation'</a> above.)</p><p>Whether or not patients should be extubated only during daytime hours has not been prospectively studied and retrospective observational data have yielded conflicting information: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 2240 patients, 31 percent were extubated at night and no differences in reintubation rates, length of stay, or mortality were reported when compared with patients extubated during day time hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, another retrospective study of almost 100,000 patients, 20 percent of whom were extubated at night, reported that compared with propensity-matched control patients extubated during daytime hours, patients who were extubated at nighttime had increased ICU mortality (6 versus 5 percent for those intubated &lt;12 hours; 11 versus 6 percent for those intubated &ge;12 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Compared with daytime extubation, nocturnal extubation had an inconsistent effect on the reintubation rate and length of stay (LOS); patients who were intubated for &lt;12 hours were more likely to have a shorter LOS (1.1 versus 1.4 days) with a similar reintubation rate (6 percent) while patients who were intubated &ge;12 hours were more likely to be reintubated (15 versus 12 percent) but had no difference in the LOS. Methodologic flaws including its retrospective nature, incomplete capture of the circumstances surrounding extubation, and analysis of older data (2000-2009) prohibit firm conclusions from this study. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTEXTUBATION MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be closely monitored following extubation. In many patients, early aggressive management with oxygenation and airway clearance can prevent reintubation. This may include suctioning, bronchodilator therapy, diuresis, or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3814198466\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen (including high flow nasal cannulae)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every patient should be oxygenated post-extubation. We prefer using devices that provide adequate oxygenation and comfort for the patient. For most patients, this goal is achieved with low flow devices (nasal prongs, simple, or venturi face masks). When higher flows of oxygen are required, high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) may offer improved oxygenation, provide a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and be better tolerated when compared with oxygen delivered through low- or high-flow face masks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p>The efficacy of HFNC in the post-extubation setting was best illustrated in a trial of 527 patients who were mechanically ventilated for an average of only one to two days and considered to be at low risk for reintubation following extubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Compared to conventional low-flow oxygen therapy, HFNC reduced the rate of reintubation at 72 hours (5 versus 12 percent) as well as the rate of respiratory failure (14 versus 8 percent). However, methodologic flaws such as imperfect blinding and the high proportion of postsurgical and neurologic patients, where HFNC may have improved secretion clearance, may have biased results in favor of HFNC. Although encouraging, this trial does not support the routine use of HFNC following extubation. </p><p>In another randomized, open-label trial of 105 patients with severe hypoxemia (partial arterial pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">oxygen/fraction</span> of inspired oxygen ratio &lt;300) prior to extubation, compared with venturi mask oxygenation, HFNC was associated with improved oxygenation, better patient comfort, fewer desaturations and interface displacements, and a lower reintubation rate at 48 hours postextubation (7 percent versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There were no mortality differences.</p><p>While further studies are required to clarify who benefits the most from HFNC after extubation, its use in those who are severely hypoxemic is appropriate. </p><p>Further details regarding HNFC in other in medical and postoperative populations and efficacy compared with NIV in postextubation patients are discussed separately.

In addition, a trial of NIV is reasonable in patients if impending acute hypercapnic respiratory failure develops soon after extubation or in those with congestive heart failure or serious comorbidities. Patients should be promptly intubated if they either fail the trial of NIV or they develop definitive acute respiratory failure before the trial of NIV can be initiated. </p><p>Evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses suggests that NIV may prevent post-extubation respiratory failure if it is applied soon after extubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-53</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One meta-analysis of 16 trials included 994 patients intubated for acute respiratory failure. Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation weaning strategies, the early application of NIV following extubation reduced all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The mortality benefit was greatest in patients with respiratory failure complicating COPD when compared to mixed populations of patients intubated for other reasons (eg, postoperative, pneumonia, non-COPD) (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.56 versus 0.81, 95% CI 0.47-1.4). Additional benefits included reduced length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay (mean difference 5.6 days and 6 days, respectively) and reduced rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15-0.43). All benefits occurred without an increased risk of extubation failure and re-intubation (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.97). Methodologic differences in weaning strategies between studies and significant heterogeneity in the outcomes studied may limit confidence in the results. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial randomly assigned 162 patients considered at risk of developing post-extubation respiratory failure to receive conventional medical therapy with or without NIV for 24 hours immediately following extubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients were considered at risk of post-extubation respiratory failure if they were 65 years or older, had an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score &gt;12 on the day of extubation, or had required intubation due to cardiac failure. NIV was associated with lower intensive care unit mortality (3 versus 14 percent), but not a lower reintubation rate, hospital mortality, or 90-day mortality. A pre-defined subgroup analysis found that the benefit of NIV was limited to patients who had hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] &gt;45 mmHg) during a pre-extubation spontaneous breathing trial, 98 percent of whom had chronic lung disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial randomly assigned 208 patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure to undergo conventional extubation, extubation followed by supplemental oxygen, or extubation followed by immediate NIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The group that received immediate NIV was less likely to develop post-extubation acute respiratory failure, defined as tachypnea (&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min),</span> bradypnea (&lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min),</span> hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90 percent, PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;64 mmHg, or PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> &le;130 mmHg despite supplemental oxygen at a flow rate &gt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> or an FiO<sub>2</sub> &ge;50 percent), respiratory acidosis (PaCO<sub>2</sub> increase of &ge;10 percent and a pH &le;7.35), or clinical signs of acute respiratory failure (eg, diaphoresis, use of accessory respiratory muscles). However, there was no difference in the mortality or reintubation rates.</p><p/><p>In contrast, NIV appears ineffective and potentially harmful if it is not initiated until after the onset of post-extubation respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. This was illustrated by a trial of 221 patients who developed respiratory failure after extubation and then were randomly assigned to receive conventional medical therapy with or without NIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Respiratory failure was defined as two or more of the following: respiratory acidosis (pH &lt;7.35 with a PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;45 mmHg), clinical signs of respiratory fatigue (ie, use of accessory muscles, intercostal retractions, paradoxical motion of the abdomen), a respiratory rate &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min</span> for two consecutive hours, or hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension &lt;80 mmHg or arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation &lt;90 percent despite a fraction of inspired oxygen &gt;50 percent). All-cause mortality increased in the NIV group (25 versus 14 percent), resulting in early termination of the trial. The increased mortality may have been related to delayed reintubation.</p><p>While the European Respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/American</span> Thoracic Society guidelines suggest not using NIV for established respiratory failure in the postextubation setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], they acknowledge that the data are flawed and that more studies are required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1284467886\"><span class=\"h2\">High flow oxygen versus noninvasive ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trials that compare HFNC and NIV in the prevention of postextubation respiratory failure have been conflicting and suffer from flaws including a lack of standardized approach to oxygenation and ventilatory support following extubation, heterogeneity in the populations studied, and variable duration of therapy. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFNC and NIV were compared in a randomized trial of 604 patients (mixed surgical and medical populations) who were extubated following mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours and were deemed at risk of reintubation (eg, age &gt;65 years, APACHE II score &gt;12, body mass index &gt;30, excess secretions, difficulty weaning, moderate to severe chronic obstructive lung disease, prolonged mechanical ventilation, airway patency issues) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. HFNC administered for 24 hours after extubation resulted in similar rates of reintubation when compared with NIV (23 versus 19 percent) and also resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in the rate of postextubation respiratory failure (26 versus 40 percent). Although the ICU length of stay was lower in those treated with HFNC, there was no difference in the rates of mortality, sepsis, or multiorgan failure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, in post-cardiac surgery patients, HFNC was reported to be equivalent to NIV in preventing reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>] However, following abdominal surgery, NIV has been found to be superior to HFNC in preventing reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. These trials are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications#H4395744\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of postoperative pulmonary complications&quot;, section on 'Postoperative respiratory failure'</a>.) </p><p/><p>The effect of HFNC on intubation rates in medical patients with acute respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] is also discussed separately.

This is probably because reintubation after unplanned extubation is often technically difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. Careful observation is appropriate for only a minority of patients who are clinically stable, have low ventilatory and oxygenation requirements, have a patent airway, and can protect their airway. Clearance of airway secretions (aggressive suctioning) is critical to avoid reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Unplanned extubation is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospitalization compared to matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Unplanned extubation occurs in 3 to 12 percent of intubated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/62,66-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,66-74</a>]. It is more common in patients who are orally intubated than those who are nasally intubated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/62,70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,70-73</a>]. It is also more frequent in patients whose endotracheal tube (ETT) is not well secured or who are agitated, have low levels of sedation, or are physically restrained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/71,72,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72,75,76</a>]. Most unplanned extubations occur within one day of planned extubation and are deliberate rather than accidental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of patients who have undergone unplanned extubation require reintubation, often within 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/71,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,74</a>]. Reintubation is more common following accidental unplanned extubation and among patients who require full ventilatory support, have higher sedation scores, and have a significant oxygen requirement (ie, fraction of inspired oxygen &gt;50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/62,63,70,72,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63,70,72,75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Extubation failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that 12 to 14 percent of patients who undergo planned extubation require reintubation within 48 to 72 hours, most within the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/5,61,74,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,61,74,78,79</a>]. Risk factors for reintubation include a weak cough and frequent suctioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Additional features that may predict reintubation include a rapid shallow breathing index &gt;58 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min</span> per L, a positive fluid balance during the 24 hours preceding extubation, and pneumonia as the reason for the initial intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Patients who are &ge;65 years old with severe chronic cardiac or respiratory disease appear to be at particularly high risk for extubation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>The impact of reintubation depends on the patient population. In medical ICU patients, reintubation is associated with increased hospital mortality, a longer ICU stay, longer hospitalization, and nosocomial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. Mortality is highest among those who fail extubation late (&gt;12 hours after extubation) or who require reintubation for reasons unrelated to the airway (ie, respiratory failure, heart failure, or encephalopathy instead of stridor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In contrast, reintubation is not associated with increased mortality in cardiac surgery patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extubation-management/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extubation refers to removal of the endotracheal tube (ETT). It is the final step in liberating a patient from mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once it is determined that a patient no longer requires mechanical ventilation to maintain sufficient ventilation and oxygenation, the patient's ability to protect the airway and airway patency should be evaluated in preparation for possible extubation. The former involves assessment of cough, level of consciousness, and amount of secretions, while the latter involves looking for a cuff leak. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Airway protection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cuff leak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients whose cough strength is weak, whose Glasgow Coma Score is &lt;8, or who require suctioning more frequently than every two to three hours, we suggest delaying extubation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The cause of the impairment should then be sought and corrected. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Airway protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients, a cuff leak does not need to be performed unless risk factors for postextubation stridor from laryngeal edema are present (eg, prolonged duration of intubation, traumatic intubation, large endotracheal tube, aspiration, presence of an orogastric or nasogastric tube). For those who have a reduced cuff leak, we suggest administering a short course of glucocorticoid therapy at least four hours prior to extubation, rather than no glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who have risk factors for laryngeal edema, but no reduced cuff leak, extubation should be decided on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Airway patency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be closely monitored following extubation. In many cases, aggressive management early can prevent reintubation. This may include suctioning, bronchodilator therapy, diuresis, or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Postextubation management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients, adequate oxygenation is achieved with low flow devices (nasal prongs, simple, or venturi face masks). When higher flows of oxygen are required, high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) may offer improved oxygenation and provide a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). (See <a href=\"#H3814198466\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen (including high flow nasal cannulae)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have hypercapnia during their pre-extubation spontaneous breathing trial, we suggest NIV immediately following extubation. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H702213029\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all other patients who are extubated, we suggest that NIV be initiated as soon as it is suspected that a patient may be failing extubation, rather than waiting until there is definitive evidence of respiratory failure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who fail a trial of NIV or develop definitive respiratory failure before NIV can be initiated, we recommend prompt reintubation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is estimated that 12 to 14 percent of patients who undergo planned extubation require reintubation. In contrast, up to 50 percent of patients who undergo unplanned extubation require reintubation. Unplanned extubation is associated with increased mortality.
