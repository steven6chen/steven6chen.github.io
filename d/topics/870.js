If a disease-causing mutation is found, the parents and siblings of the proband should be screened for the same mutation, even if they are asymptomatic, to guide genetic counseling and because of the increased risk for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-children-due-to-decreased-red-blood-cell-production/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Abnormal laboratory findings in DBA consist primarily of anemia, which is generally macrocytic (ie, increased RBC mean corpuscular volume [MCV]).

They are characterized by reticulocytopenia and anemia, which is generally normocytic and normochromic. (See <a href=\"#H1413430135\" class=\"local\">'Pure red cell aplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital PRCA that usually presents in infancy. Approximately one-third to one-half of patients with DBA have associated malformations, most commonly craniofacial anomalies; approximately 45 percent of cases are familial. DBA is associated with a predisposition to cancer. The laboratory evaluation of a patient with suspected DBA should include a complete blood count with RBC indices, reticulocyte count, measurement of hemoglobin F (eg, by hemoglobin electrophoresis), and erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity. The results will establish whether the anemia is due to decreased RBC production and help to distinguish DBA from transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76264\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76264 \">table 2</a>). The mainstays of therapy of DBA are corticosteroids and blood transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diamond-Blackfan anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired PRCA may occur due to infectious and noninfectious etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78795\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78795 \">table 4</a>). The most common infectious cause of acquired red cell aplasia is parvovirus B19. Other infectious causes include hepatitis A, B, and C, Epstein-Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Noninfectious causes of acquired red cell aplasia include drugs, autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), thymoma, malignancies, and autoantibodies. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Infectious agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Acquired causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TEC is a self-limited red cell aplasia of unclear etiology occurring in previously healthy children (typically between the ages of one and four), due to a temporary cessation of erythrocyte production. It is the most common cause of PRCA in children and should be suspected in an otherwise healthy child with anemia and reticulocytopenia. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow failure resulting in red cell aplasia may also occur as result of acquired aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia or other inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, infiltrating malignancies, or myelofibrosis.
