However, in some individuals, the ulcer is either refractory to conventional therapy or recurs following successful initial treatment. This topic will review the factors associated with refractory and recurrent peptic ulcer disease, and the evaluation and management of patients with refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer disease. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and initial management of peptic ulcer disease are discussed in detail, separately.

The last situation is likely to occur due to the selection of an inappropriate regimen, antibiotic resistance (particularly to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>), or poor patient compliance.

In an illustrative study that included 60 patients with refractory peptic ulcer and 54 nonrefractory matched controls, NSAID and analgesic abuse was a significant predictor of ulcer refractoriness, present in 40 percent of those with nonhealing ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-or-recurrent-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Forty-four percent of NSAID use was surreptitious and was detected by measuring platelet cyclooxygenase activity. Other medications (eg, glucocorticoids, cytotoxic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>) and substances (eg, cocaine) may also contribute to ulcerogenesis or affect ulcer healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103833\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103833 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-or-recurrent-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Ulcer size also impacts the healing time. Some studies suggest that large and small gastric ulcers heal at the same rate of approximately 3 mm per week, therefore larger ulcers will require more time to heal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-or-recurrent-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, another explanation for slow healing in patients with large ulcers is that they are often associated with fibrosis, which in turn adversely affects ulcer healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-or-recurrent-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate inhibition of acid secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor compliance with antisecretory therapy and tolerance to histamine 2 receptor antagonists can contribute to recurrent and refractory peptic ulceration. Although tolerance does not develop with PPIs, rapid P450 mediated metabolism might account for incomplete inhibition of acid secretion and failure of PPI therapy in a small subset of patients. Other mechanisms of PPI resistance are rare and still poorly defined.

A small number of patients with acid hypersecretion have recurrent ulcers with neither of these risk factors.

Surgical management of peptic ulcer disease is rarely required and is reserved for the gastric ulcers that fail to heal after twice-daily antisecretory therapy with a PPI for 24 weeks in whom other correctable factors (eg, medication noncompliance, NSAID use, and <em>H. pylori</em> infection) have been addressed. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2294659\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2172157052\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Andrew H.
