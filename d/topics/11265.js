Such tests have dramatically impacted both the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is particularly true for central nervous system (CNS) infections where rapid, accurate identification of a pathogen and prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy are potentially lifesaving.</p><p>The increasing availability and use of molecular tests for the detection of microorganisms from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has redefined our approach to common CNS infections, such as meningitis, encephalitis, and brain mass lesions (particularly in HIV-infected individuals or other immunocompromised hosts), and improved our ability to identify the etiologic agent responsible for other CNS syndromes, such as transverse myelitis.</p><p>The unique aspects of molecular testing as applied to CNS infections and guidance in the use and interpretation of molecular testing for pathogens commonly encountered in the management of patients with CNS infections will be reviewed here. Management of specific CNS infections is discussed in the appropriate topics.

Furthermore, CSF typically lacks common inhibitors of nucleic acid amplification methods (eg, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) such as heme, endonucleases, and exonucleases that can lead to false-negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, direct detection of nucleic acids from CNS samples may be less prone to common causes of false-positive (eg, contamination or presence of nonpathogenic colonization) or false-negative (eg, inhibition) results compared with other body sites.</p><p>Targeted nucleic acid detection methods are often more sensitive than conventional culture-based or antigen detection methods and may detect organisms that are nonviable or uncultivable. However, except for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and JC virus, the true clinical sensitivity of most molecular tests for CNS infections is not known because there are few studies utilizing a reference standard (eg, brain biopsy) for comparison.</p><p>Multiplex or panel-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) combine multiple individual NATs into a single test, thereby allowing clinicians to test for an array of potential pathogens that may cause a clinical syndrome at the same time. In 2015, the first commercial multiplex NAT for infectious causes of community-acquired meningitis and encephalitis was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as an aid in the diagnosis of these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This multiplex NAT detects 14 bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens in just over one hour, including <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae</em> (ie, group B <em>Streptococcus</em>), <em>Escherichia coli </em>(K1 serotype only), <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV-) 1, HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV),<em> </em>cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), human parechovirus, and <em>Cryptococcus <span class=\"nowrap\">neoformans/gattii</em></span>. </p><p>Results from a large study of this assay showed a high level of agreement with comparator methods (&gt;99 percent overall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, as with other NATs, this multiplex NAT does not detect all causes of central nervous system infection or provide antimicrobial susceptibility results, and false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Notably, nearly 1 in 6 positive results (15.6 percent) in the study were classified as false positives after analysis of discrepant results, and the assay may have reduced sensitivity for some pathogens relative to conventional tests (eg, HSV-1, group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Cryptococcus</em>, enterovirus, HHV-6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Thus, it is important for clinicians to perform standard microbiologic tests such as CSF bacterial culture when infections are suspected even when the multiplex NAT is used and not use it as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, and other management decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Next-generation sequencing is another rapidly evolving molecular technology that has the potential to provide a direct unbiased analysis of the microbial composition of clinical samples without reliance on traditional culture or targeted molecular tests. For example, next-generation sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid was used to diagnose neuroleptospirosis in a 14-year-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency who had developed unexplained fever and progressive neurologic deterioration after an extensive infectious disease evaluation (including 16S rRNA bacterial PCR testing) was unrevealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subsequent testing (targeted PCR for <em>Leptospira</em>, Sanger sequencing, and IgM antibody by latex agglutination enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) confirmed the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Commercial versus noncommercial assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most commercially available molecular tests for CSF or CNS specimens have not been approved or cleared by the FDA and are laboratory-developed tests that have been validated for CNS specimens in laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing. As a result, the majority of assays are not standardized between laboratories, and interlaboratory variability is common. Analytical sensitivity may vary significantly, and quantitative values (eg, viral load, copy number) are not comparable between laboratories. For both commercial and noncommercial assays, testing specificity for a given organism depends on the uniqueness of the target being amplified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">False-positive and -negative results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite advances in test design and understanding, false-negative and false-positive results may still occur and do <strong>not</strong> always indicate laboratory error or test failure. Potential causes for false-negative test results (ie, failure to detect nucleic acid despite active infection due to the targeted pathogen) include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient analytical sensitivity of a laboratory's assay for the specific microorganism (eg, concentration of the organism [nucleic acid] is below the functional limit of detection)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Inhibition&quot; of amplification (most commonly due to a &quot;bloody tap,&quot; CSF fluid with high number of erythrocytes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of the assay to amplify or detect the intended microorganism in the absence of inhibition (rare, usually due to unrecognized species genetic variation or high rate of mutation, as with RNA viruses)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient clinical sensitivity (eg, concentration of the microorganism is low in the submitted sample due to pathophysiology of the disease [eg, West Nile virus], prolonged treatment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immune clearance)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sampling error (occurs at low nucleic acid concentration and is related to the inherently small test volumes used in molecular testing)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to test for the causative organism (eg, appropriate pathogen-specific test not performed, as most molecular tests detect only a single targeted pathogen)</p><p/><p>Likewise, a positive NAT result for a specific pathogen may not always indicate CNS disease due to that pathogen and should be interpreted with caution. Due to the extreme sensitivity of these assays, there is an inherent risk of false-positive results due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amplification of a contaminating organism introduced at the time of specimen collection (eg, nonsterile technique, blood contamination of CSF) or post-collection (eg, in the laboratory)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amplification of a noncausative &quot;bystander&quot; (eg, microorganism present in circulating leukocytes that cross the blood-brain barrier during acute inflammation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amplification of nucleic acid from a latent (not active) infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of specificity of assay primer or probe sequences</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of clinical correlation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Test results should be analyzed in the context of the probability of infection. In the absence of an elevated leukocyte count or elevated protein level in the CSF, the likelihood of a true positive molecular result for an infectious pathogen is significantly reduced, while the number of false-positive and uninterpretable results increase. Limiting utilization of CSF molecular tests to those patients with a moderate to high pretest probability of having CNS disease based on clinical presentation, disease prevalence, and CSF parameters increases the predictive value of test results and reduces cost.</p><p>The efficacy of using screening criteria before molecular diagnostic testing was illustrated by a retrospective review of protein and leukocyte counts for 974 CSF specimens submitted for PCR analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among the samples tested for HSV, all 13 of the patients with a positive HSV PCR result had either an elevated CSF white blood cell count or protein level, while none of the 202 samples with normal CSF parameters were positive. However, screening based on the presence or absence of abnormal CSF parameters may not be appropriate for patients who are immunocompromised, neonates, or for those with intraparenchymal (but not meningeal) inflammation (ie, encephalitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF MOLECULAR TESTING BY CNS SYNDROME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a patient with suspected meningitis routinely includes molecular testing, particularly when viral etiologies are considered. Traditional nonmolecular testing remains clinically useful, however, and in many cases should be used in conjunction with molecular testing (eg, culture or serologic evaluations). Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count, glucose, and protein analyses maintain traditional predictive value and have been examined for their potential in screening CSF samples prior to the performance of molecular testing (eg, enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus [HSV]). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Importance of clinical correlation'</a> above.)</p><p>A summary of molecular tests available for specific pathogens and the recommended test method(s) for diagnosis in patients with suspected meningitis is presented in the following Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58078 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram stain and culture remain the methods of choice for diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared multiplex nucleic acid amplification test (NAT), which detects most common causes of community-acquired (including neonatal) bacterial meningitis, may be useful as an adjunct to culture, especially in patients who have already received antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nucleic acid amplification testing may also be useful in select cases when uncultivable or fastidious organisms are suspected (eg, <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp, <em>Brucella</em> spp, or <em>Tropheryma whipplei</em>), although these assays are not widely available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Mycobacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct detection of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from CSF (eg, tuberculous meningitis) is routinely available from reference laboratories and recommended as an adjunct to traditional mycobacterial culture when clinical suspicion for tuberculosis meningitis is high. Mycobacterial culture should also always be ordered when a diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is suspected given the poor sensitivity of molecular testing from CSF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-nervous-system-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central nervous system tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Rickettsia and spirochetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molecular testing for <em>Rickettsia</em> and spirochetes is investigational and not routinely available. Serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CSF evaluations for serologic response and titers remain the primary methods of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of molecular methods for the detection of enteroviruses and Herpesviridae (eg, HSV, varicella-zoster virus [VZV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], and Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) is standard of care when central nervous system (CNS) infection due to these viruses is suspected. Targeted single-pathogen NATs are typically used, although an FDA-cleared multiplex NAT, which detects enterovirus, HSV-1 and -2, VZV, CMV, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and parechovirus<em> </em>simultaneously, is also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most enteroviral NATs do not detect parechoviruses, making it necessary to order specific NATs for these when they are suspected clinically.</p><p>Molecular testing for the arthropod-transmitted viruses is less well characterized, with the possible exception of West Nile virus (WNV), the only agent for which NAT is routinely available. However, evaluation of serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CSF for the presence of an antibody response to WNV is preferred to molecular tests for this virus unless patients are immunocompromised. In cases when CNS disease due to respiratory virus is suspected, testing of alternative non-CNS sources (eg, respiratory specimens) alone or in conjunction with CSF optimizes diagnostic yield.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Fungi and parasites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fungal and parasite stains, culture, histology, and serology are usually preferred when suspected clinically, although <em>Cryptococcus <span class=\"nowrap\">neoformans/gattii</em></span> is included in an FDA-cleared multiplex NAT as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other molecular assays for fungi and parasites are occasionally available but insufficiently characterized for formal recommendation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Encephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of encephalitis is extensive and includes both infectious and noninfectious causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Testing, in particular molecular testing, for specific infectious agents should be guided by epidemiology, risk factors, test availability, and clinical presentation. A combination of traditional diagnostic studies (eg, CSF analysis, imaging) potentially including microbiologic cultures of non-CNS sites should be employed prior to or concurrent with molecular testing. Molecular diagnostic methods should be included in the evaluation of suspected viral encephalitis whenever possible. However, with the exception of HSV encephalitis, the clinical sensitivity and predictive value of molecular testing from CSF for intraparenchymal disease remains largely undefined. Thus, while molecular testing of CSF or brain tissue is considered a primary method of diagnosis for many viral causes of encephalitis (eg, HSV), negative results may not exclude infection, and a combined diagnostic approach including serology, imaging, repeat molecular testing, and occasionally biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pcr-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-in-patients-with-encephalitis-or-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PCR testing for the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus in patients with encephalitis or meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, molecular testing should be negative in postinfectious encephalitis (ie, an immune-mediated disease). The clinical history, serology, and potentially other studies may be necessary to document recent primary infection outside the CNS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-encephalitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral encephalitis in adults&quot;</a>). A summary of molecular testing methods that may be useful in the evaluation of patients with encephalitis is provided in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80353 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meningoencephalitis from bacteria is uncommon, but NATs may be useful in selected cases, such as when the exposure or patient history suggests a fastidious, slow-growing, or uncultivable bacteria such as <em>Coxiella burnetii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> may be a more common cause of nonviral encephalitis than was previously recognized, but NAT of CSF has a low diagnostic yield relative to serology. NAT of respiratory secretions may support the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>].

For several herpesviruses, quantitative assays are increasingly used to aid in the distinction of latent infection of host leukocytes or chromosomal integration into host cells (eg, HHV-6) from active infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-infections/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. However, it is important to note that the sensitivity and negative predictive value of NATs from CSF for viruses other than HSV are not well defined.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nucleic acid detection methods are often more sensitive than conventional culture-based or antigen detection methods and may detect organisms that are nonviable or uncultivable. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Except for herpes simplex virus and JC virus, the true clinical sensitivity of most molecular tests for CNS infections is not known because there are few studies utilizing a reference standard (eg, brain biopsy) for comparison. In addition, there remain few US Food and Drug Administration&ndash;approved assays for CNS samples, and the majority of assays in common use are not standardized between laboratories, and interlaboratory variability makes quantitative values (eg, viral load, copy number) not comparable between laboratories. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Commercial versus noncommercial assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite advances in test design and understanding, false-negative and false-positive results may still occur. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'False-positive and -negative results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test results should always be analyzed in the context of the pretest probability of infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Importance of clinical correlation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A summary of molecular test availability for specific pathogens and the recommended test method(s) for diagnosis in patients with suspected meningitis, encephalitis, transverse myelitis, and brain abscess is presented in the Tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58078 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80353 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59579\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59579 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68813\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68813 \">table 4</a>).
