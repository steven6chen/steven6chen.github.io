On the other hand, temporary cessation of beta blocker therapy is reasonable if the exacerbation is characterized by hypoperfusion, bradycardia, or the requirement for inotropic drugs. </p><p>For patients with advanced HF who require inotropic therapy, prior beta blocker therapy impairs the response to beta agonist therapy. For a patient who has been taking a beta blocker who requires inotropic therapy, an inotrope that acts independent of the beta adrenergic receptor (such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a>) is preferred.

Metoprolol is a relatively selective beta-1-receptor blocker that results in beta-1 receptor upregulation and does not inhibit the dobutamine effect on the beta-2 receptors. In contrast, carvedilol does not cause upregulation of the beta-1 receptors and blocks the beta-2 receptors, inhibiting both inotropic mechanisms of dobutamine. Inotropes that act independent of the beta adrenergic receptor, such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone, are preferred in this setting. Beta blocker therapy is stopped during the acute severe HF exacerbation. Reintroduction of the beta blocker is warranted if the patient stabilizes.

The meta-analysis found no significant reduction in mortality from beta blocker therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and HF, though this could reflect inadequate power. The much larger observational study found an association between beta blocker therapy and reduced mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation and HF but may be subject to confounding and bias. </p><p>However, beta blockers continue to serve as a primary therapy for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HFrEF given their efficacy for rate control and the limitations of alternative therapies. Most calcium channel blockers (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>) are avoided in patients with HFrEF due to potential adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/3,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,100</a>], and beta blockers provide better rate control than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>.
