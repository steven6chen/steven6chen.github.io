Although less common, toe rings may also become constricting. In addition to rings, children may put metal washers or nuts over their fingers or toes. Although rare, penile entrapment in teenage or adult males has been described after patients place various constriction devices around their penis or scrotum to maintain or enhance an erection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3252604274\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon anecdotal experience, ring entrapment may present in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A correctly sized ring becomes tight when the finger or, less commonly, the toe swells due to dependent extremity positioning (often while sleeping), local trauma, infection, allergic angioedema, excessive salt intake, or any other condition that causes swollen fingers or toes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A young child puts a tight ring, metal nut, or metal washer on to the finger or toe as part of normal exploratory behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adolescent or adult male puts a constricting ring around the penis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scrotum to enhance an erection, and excessive swelling prevents subsequent removal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56282111\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1898083628\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should determine how long the ring has been on the digit or external genitalia, the composition of the ring, and removal methods already attempted.</p><p>If trauma is the cause of entrapment, the mechanism and timing of the injury should be assessed.

The approach presented in this topic has been developed based upon clinical experience and small observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H976577581\"><span class=\"h3\">Digital entrapment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to ring removal from the finger or toe is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F116572\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116572 \">algorithm 1</a>) and summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemia, nerve injury, or local trauma</strong> &ndash; Patients with signs of neurovascular compromise (eg, mottling, very delayed or absent capillary refill, blue-gray or white color, or digital nerve injury with loss of sensation) or local trauma with a deep wound, suspected fracture, or dislocation should undergo emergency ring removal by cutting or breaking the ring. When known, the ring composition determines the proper tool necessary for removal. These patients also frequently warrant emergency consultation with a hand, plastics, or orthopedic surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H834260608\" class=\"local\">'Cut or break the ring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>No ischemia, nerve injury, or local trauma</strong> &ndash; Inexpensive, thin, soft metal or plastic rings should be cut off with a hand-operated ring cutter. Otherwise, the clinician may attempt one of the methods to remove an intact ring. (See <a href=\"#H2081325082\" class=\"local\">'Remove the ring intact'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3867697135\"><span class=\"h3\">Penile entrapment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penile ring entrapment should be considered a potential urologic emergency. Penile rings in adult males are most often placed to maintain an erection and typically encircle the penis or, rarely, are placed around the penis and scrotum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. Other strangulation devices can include nonmetallic rings, bottles, and elastic bands. Patient embarrassment may result in delayed presentation with varying degrees of penile injury due to progressive venous, lymphatic, and arterial obstruction. Urethral injury or penile necrosis is associated with rings in place for longer than 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Evaluation of the entrapped genitalia should include assessment of color, sensation, ability to void, presence of lacerations, and evidence of deeper injury including urethral fistula or ischemic injury. Most patients present with low grade injuries, such as penile edema and skin ulceration, with minimal distal sensation loss, and prompt removal can usually be performed. Penile blocks can be used for pain control, if necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-zipper-injuries#H2311462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of zipper injuries&quot;, section on 'Dorsal penile block'</a>.)</p><p>Successful methods of removal in the urologic literature include those that leave the ring intact or, more commonly, cutting or breaking the ring. The method of removal will depend on the composition and size of the ring or constriction device, the incarceration time, and the degree of penile injury at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6</a>]. Rings at the base of the scrotum are approached in the same way as those encircling the penis. </p><p>Males with penile constriction devices and signs of penile ischemia or urethral injury warrant emergency consultation with a urologist and removal by cutting or breaking the ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H834260608\" class=\"local\">'Cut or break the ring'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with preserved penile perfusion may undergo removal of an intact ring or have the ring cut off. In difficult cases, multiple penile needle pricks with manual compression to reduce edema or penile aspiration by a urologist or other physician with expertise with these procedures may facilitate removal of an intact ring that cannot be easily cut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2081325082\" class=\"local\">'Remove the ring intact'</a> below.)</p><p>After ring removal, the penis should be examined thoroughly to assess vascular status. Most patients have minor penile edema with or without minor skin ulceration and can be discharged once they demonstrate that they are able to void normally. The clinician should advise the patient that penile constriction devices be avoided but, if used, should remain in place for no longer than 30 minutes. Furthermore, if the patient plans to persist in using such devices, a medically approved hinged device with a release mechanism is strongly recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>More severe injuries warrant further evaluation as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color Doppler sonography is indicated if penile perfusion does not rapidly recover after ring removal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is significant skin ulceration to the level of the urethra or suspicion of cutaneous urethral fistula formation, then evaluation of urethral integrity should be performed by cystoscopy or contrast urethrography.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3190318891\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key interventions prior to ring removal include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Control pain </strong>&ndash; With careful explanation of the procedure, the clinician often can cut off or break a ring without anesthesia. This approach allows the patient to give feedback regarding overheating of the ring during cutting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When removing an intact ring, pain control is usually necessary. Regional infiltrative anesthesia by digital block or dorsal penile block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69794\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69794 \">figure 1</a>) suffices for most cooperative adolescents and adults.

Standard ring cutters are usually not effective for removing hard metal (eg, steel or titanium), tungsten carbide, or ceramic rings. Before each use, check the saw blade of the ring cutter to ensure that is it sharp and clean. Show the patient how the guard prevents cutting of the finger.</p><p>The procedural steps are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to use, cover any open wounds to prevent metal filings from entering and causing foreign body reactions and chronic synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the guard of the ring cutter under the ring on the palmar aspect of the hand or the plantar aspect of the foot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If possible, rotate the ring so that the thinnest part of the band is located under the saw blade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply the saw blade wheel to the ring and turn it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53966\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53966 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The friction of the ring cutting process generates heat. Interrupt the procedure periodically to allow the ring to cool. If necessary, drip ice water onto the ring to hasten the cooling process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the ring is fully cut, use hemostats to grab the two edges and pry open the ring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, cut the ring in two places to permit removal. When making the second cut, protect the skin under the first cut from sharp edges by placing gauze under the cut ring.

Turn the knob until the ring breaks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Groove joint or other non-locking pliers &ndash; Because of less chance for injury to the finger, locking pliers or a ring vise is preferred. Adjust so that the jaws of the non-locking pliers close opposite of each other when applied to the ring. Apply the pliers circumferentially and close them steadily and under control. Stop applying pressure as soon as the ring breaks to avoid pinching the finger.</p><p/><p>Occasionally, tungsten carbide or ceramic rings are lined with a metal band that is then removed using a ring cutter.

When attempting removal of an intact ring, apply ice and, for digital rings, elevate the extremity to decrease swelling prior to the procedure. Apply soap or water-soluble lubricant liberally to the entrapped digit or penis. These techniques are painful and use of regional anesthesia or procedural sedation is typically necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Tightly wrap a second Penrose drain, starting at the first one and extending back to the incarcerated ring. Repeat as necessary until the edema is sufficiently reduced to remove the ring. Once the ring passes the PIP joint, remove the first Penrose drain. In a case series of 12 patients, the double Penrose drain technique led to successful manual ring removal in all patients, including those with digital trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ring-entrapment-and-removal/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elastic tape method &ndash; Apply a blood pressure cuff to the affected extremity and inflate it to the patient's systolic blood pressure plus 100 mmHg.

Patients with ring entrapment typically have marked distal swelling which may be complicated by ischemia or, for digits, local trauma with an associated fracture, dislocation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laceration. (See <a href=\"#H56282111\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3019722316\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An approach to ring removal from the finger or toe based upon clinical experience is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F116572\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116572 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H976577581\" class=\"local\">'Digital entrapment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with signs of ischemia, nerve injury or local trauma with a deep wound, suspected fracture, or dislocation should undergo emergency ring removed by cutting or breaking the ring. When known, the ring composition determines the proper tool necessary for removal (see <a href=\"#H834260608\" class=\"local\">'Cut or break the ring'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Soft metal (eg, gold, silver, or copper) or plastic &ndash; Hand-operated or electric ring cutter. (See <a href=\"#H3886659505\" class=\"local\">'Soft metal or plastic rings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Hard metal (eg, steel or titanium) &ndash; Electric power tool (eg, dental drill, Dremel saw, or air driven grinder). (See <a href=\"#H2713454419\" class=\"local\">'Hard metal (eg, steel or titanium) rings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Tungsten carbide or ceramic &ndash; Locking pliers, ring vise, or vise grips to break the ring. (See <a href=\"#H1994364187\" class=\"local\">'Tungsten carbide or ceramic rings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Unknown composition &ndash; When the composition of the ring is not known by history or apparent upon examination and cutting the ring is indicated, the clinician should first use a hand-operated or electric ring cutter. If the ring cutter is ineffective, then the ring is likely made of hard metal, tungsten carbide, ceramic, or stone and will require cutting with a power tool (hard metal) or breaking using a ring vise or locking pliers (tungsten carbide, ceramic, or stone ring). (See <a href=\"#H1524059079\" class=\"local\">'Unknown composition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without ischemia, nerve injury, or local trauma, the approach is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Inexpensive thin soft metal or plastic rings should be cut off with a hand-operated ring cutter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53966\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53966 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3886659505\" class=\"local\">'Soft metal or plastic rings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Valuable rings may be removed intact. Removal of an intact ring is often painful and use of regional anesthesia in adolescents and adults and procedural sedation in children is typically necessary. Before performing the procedure, prepare the wound, reduce swelling, and lubricate the digit or penis. Manual removal may be attempted after using elastic tape or double Penrose wrapping to reduce swelling. Alternatively, the string or elastic pull technique or string wrap technique may be employed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69794\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69794 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68736\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68736 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53497 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53966\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53966 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2081325082\" class=\"local\">'Remove the ring intact'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Males with penile constriction devices and signs of penile ischemia or necrosis warrant emergency consultation with a urologist and emergency removal by cutting or breaking the ring. (See <a href=\"#H834260608\" class=\"local\">'Cut or break the ring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with preserved penile perfusion may undergo removal of an intact ring or have the ring cut off. Many of the techniques described for removal of an intact ring also work for the removal of penile constriction devices. In difficult cases, multiple superficial penile needle pricks followed by manual compression to relieve edema or penile aspiration by a urologist or other physician with expertise with these procedures may facilitate removal of an intact ring. (See <a href=\"#H2081325082\" class=\"local\">'Remove the ring intact'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After ring removal, the digit or penis should be cleaned, any open wounds dressed with antibiotic ointment, and tetanus status assessed with prophylaxis given as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Post-procedural care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After digital ring removal, consultation with a hand, plastics, or orthopedic surgeon is indicated for patients with persistent ischemia, digital nerve injury, tendon injury, open fracture or dislocation, or an unstable fracture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After penile ring removal, emergency urology consultation is indicated for patients with penile ring entrapment and persistent signs of penile ischemia, difficulty voiding, significant skin ulceration to the level of the urethra or suspicion of cutaneous urethral fistula formation.
