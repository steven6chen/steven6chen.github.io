Recurrence of low-grade papillary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in this setting is the most common type of recurrence, since high-grade disease generally has been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravesical-bacillus-calmette-guerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) unless there is a contraindication.

In this situation, it is critical to distinguish intermediate- from high-risk, and prior intravesical chemotherapy from intravesical BCG in choosing the next line of therapy.</p><p>Standard definitions of post-BCG states have evolved to guide both clinical decision-making and clinical trial design. These definitions have developed primarily through consensus building between the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Urological Association (AUA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;BCG failure&quot; refers to patients with either intermediate- or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who received a single round of induction BCG without maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;BCG unresponsive&quot; has replaced the older term &quot;BCG-refractory.&quot; BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer encompasses patients with one of the following in the absence of urothelial carcinoma of the prostatic urethra or upper tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent or recurrent <strong>high-grade</strong> <span class=\"nowrap\">Ta/Tis</span> urothelial carcinoma of the bladder after completion of at least induction (&ge;5 doses) and one round of maintenance (or second induction; &ge;2 doses) intravesical BCG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent or recurrent <strong>high-grade</strong> T1 bladder cancer after induction BCG (&ge;5 doses) without further maintenance therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial complete response (no disease six months after diagnosis) followed by subsequent <strong>high-grade</strong> recurrence within six months after the last BCG dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a relapse more than six months after the last dose of BCG are considered to have a late relapse and would not be considered to have BCG unresponsive disease.</p><p/><p>Time to relapse is incorporated into this definition of a post-BCG recurrence because it has been shown to correlate with the subsequent response to another challenge with intravesical BCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The importance of time to relapse was originally described in a study that found that BCG plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-alfa-2b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon alfa-2b</a> was as effective in patients who had failed prior BCG as it was in BCG-na&iuml;ve patients if the last dose of BCG was administered &ge;12 months previously. In a retrospective subset analysis of 334 patients (98 with carcinoma in situ [CIS] and 236 with papillary disease only) who had all received at least one prior course of BCG, recurrence within six months adversely affected subsequent response to additional BCG, but recurrence between 6 and 12 months was no different than recurrence after 12 months. This held true for both CIS and papillary disease. The six-month cut-off has, therefore, been incorporated into the definition of BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer.</p><p>A low-grade papillary (Ta) recurrence does not qualify as BCG unresponsive and is generally not considered an indication to discontinue BCG therapy in a patient being treated for high-risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There is no standardization of disease states following intravesical chemotherapy since BCG is considered the more effective therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872727973\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent or persistent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is usually diagnosed by surveillance cystoscopy or urine cytology during surveillance after initial treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H1973563061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>.)</p><p>Technical improvements are being evaluated to improve the efficiency of cystoscopy in detecting recurrent or persistent disease. Fluorescence (blue light) cystoscopy and narrow band imaging (NBI) are being used more widely in the initial evaluation of patients with possible non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, the role of these techniques is less well established for the detection and resection of recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and after BCG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H1354236219\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Fluorescence endoscopy and narrow band imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Various urine biomarkers have demonstrated a substantially higher sensitivity than urine cytology but with a significantly lower specificity. Despite the promise of urine biomarkers, cystoscopy remains the procedure of choice for surveillance in previously treated patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine biomarkers for the detection of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of the upper urinary tracts (kidneys and ureters) as well as the prostatic urethra is also critical in the surveillance of patients with prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Although this is obvious for patients with positive cytology but no visible bladder lesion, even patients with a recurrence in the bladder can have concomitant extravesical sites of recurrence, which must be identified before initiating salvage therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H1973563061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The importance of a detailed evaluation of the entire urothelial surface is illustrated by a study on the site of recurrence in 110 patients who had recurrent urothelial carcinoma after receiving adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravesical-bacillus-calmette-guerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Recurrence limited to the bladder was detected in 53 cases (48 percent), while 14 (13 percent) had only upper urinary tract <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prostatic urethral involvement, and 43 (39 percent) had both bladder and other urothelial sites of disease recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3658632034\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with recurrent or persistent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, a balance must be struck between the risk of progression to muscle invasive disease or distant metastasis and the risk of toxicity from treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3811117120\"><span class=\"h2\">Transurethral resection of bladder tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary management of all recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT; for papillary tumors) or biopsy (for carcinoma in situ [CIS]). TURBT for a persistent or recurrent lesion does not differ markedly from TURBT at the initial diagnosis. </p><p>Office fulguration of recurrent disease may be considered as an alternative in carefully selected patients with fewer than five, small (&lt;0.5 cm), low-grade-appearing lesions in the context of a history of prior low-grade Ta tumors and negative cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For patients with an established pattern of low-grade recurrences, especially if older or with significant co-morbidities, an initial period of surveillance is reasonable, with intervention only necessary if the tumor size or number increases, or the patient develops symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Persistent high-grade T1 bladder cancer at the time of re-TURBT after initial diagnosis of high-grade T1 disease, based on complete TUR, does not necessarily constitute recurrent disease. However, it is worth emphasizing that the risk of progression in this setting is up to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], so patients meeting these criteria should be considered for immediate cystectomy. (See <a href=\"#H408895962\" class=\"local\">'Radical cystectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, there should usually be no need for repeat TURBT in patients with recurrent high-grade T1 disease after intravesical therapy because these patients should undergo radical cystectomy. If the patient refuses cystectomy or is unfit for more aggressive surgery and does not undergo radiotherapy, then re-TURBT should be considered to stage the patient optimally, minimize the residual disease, and potentially optimize subsequent courses of intravesical therapy.</p><p>Otherwise, the greatest challenge of TURBT in the setting of recurrence is the detection of CIS, either alone or in addition to papillary disease. In both instances, the CIS may provide the impetus to proceed with radical cystectomy versus additional intravesical therapy. Prior TURBT and prior intravesical therapy may increase the likelihood of false positive lesions on cystoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3045620553\"><span class=\"h3\">Single-dose perioperative chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single-dose perioperative intravesical chemotherapy is most efficacious for low-grade lesions at the time of initial diagnosis. The benefit of a single dose of perioperative chemotherapy in association with TURBT for recurrence is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H599063142\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Single postoperative instillation'</a>.)</p><p>A 2016 meta-analysis offers some information about the role of perioperative chemotherapy in the context of recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Instillation did not reduce the rate of recurrence in patients with a prior history of more than one recurrence per year. Furthermore, single-dose chemotherapy in patients with a European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recurrence score &ge;5 was of no benefit. </p><p>The parameters that determine the EORTC recurrence and progressions scores are reproduced in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108292\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108292 \">table 2</a>). As an example, a patient with multifocal disease (two to seven tumors) who has recurred within less than one year has a recurrence score of 7.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H594672805\"><span class=\"h2\">No prior adjuvant intravesical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-line adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravesical-bacillus-calmette-guerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) therapy is the standard of care for the first occurrence of high-risk disease, and subsequent intravesical therapy for recurrent or persistent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer represents salvage therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1543790888\" class=\"local\">'Salvage intravesical therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>For intermediate-risk disease, however, many patients may not have had prior intravesical therapy, and the disease recurrence may be the impetus for adjuvant intravesical BCG or chemotherapy. Intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer represents a spectrum of disease, and it should not be automatic that all patients with recurrent low-grade disease need intravesical therapy. A balance must be struck between the risk of progression, on the one hand, and the risk of toxicity from treatment on the other hand.</p><p>For recurrent intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the risk of progression depends on the size of tumor, the number of sites of involvement, and the rate of recurrence (EORTC Tables) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The International Bladder Cancer Group developed a consensus statement that offers a risk-adapted treatment algorithm for different patient subsets within the context of intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Based on the number of risk factors that a patient with intermediate-risk disease has, they are treated as low risk (0 risk factors), intermediate-risk (1 to 2 risk factors), or high risk (3 to 4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108292\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108292 \">table 2</a>). Those treated as low risk do not require anything beyond TURBT and optional single perioperative dose of chemotherapy, even though they are classified as having intermediate-risk disease. These include the infrequently recurring, solitary, small Ta lesions. Those treated as intermediate-risk should receive adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or BCG including one year maintenance therapy, and those treated as high risk should receive intravesical BCG with three years of maintenance therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1543790888\"><span class=\"h2\">Salvage intravesical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal first-line therapy will decrease the need for salvage therapy. Optimal first-line therapy includes key components, such as complete TURBT, assurance that muscularis propria is sampled in the TURBT specimen, repeat TURBT for high-grade T1 disease, use of maintenance BCG, and adequate evaluation of the upper tracts. Immediate cystectomy should be considered for the highest risk patients (eg, high-grade T1 with lymphovascular invasion [LVI] and concomitant CIS) so that these patients do not require salvage therapy. </p><p>Furthermore, it is important not to discontinue first-line therapy too soon and label a patient as a treatment failure. This is particularly true for patients with CIS, who can have a delayed response after induction BCG and should not be deemed treatment failures until after completion of the first round of maintenance BCG. The rate of complete response at three and six months in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 8507 trial was 55 and 84 percent, respectively, for patients receiving maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Salvage treatment strategies for recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including both salvage intravesical therapy and radical cystectomy, are summarized in the table according to the different disease states (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108293 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>While not explicitly part of the European Association of Urology (EAU) risk classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], high-grade T1 bladder cancer in the context of treatment-refractory disease warrants the designation &quot;very high-risk&quot; disease when compared with Ta and Cis, which are classified as high-risk disease. This is reflected in the definition of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which includes high-grade T1 disease after failing induction BCG alone but includes Ta and Cis only after failing induction plus the first round of maintenance BCG or a second course of induction BCG. </p><p>The very high risk associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">recurrent/persistent</span> high-grade T1 tumor is demonstrated by two large retrospective series. In a Spanish series of 191 high-risk patients treated with TURBT and BCG, those with high-grade T1 disease at baseline and less than a complete response at three months had an 80 percent risk of subsequent progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Similarly, in a cohort of 195 patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the rate of progression (including metastasis or the development of &quot;uncontrolled local disease&quot;) was 82 percent for patients with T1 disease at three months versus 25 percent for patients without T1 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>If a patient has BCG-unresponsive, high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, outcomes after intravesical chemotherapy with a variety of agents in the second-line setting have been uniformly poor, with two-year recurrence-free survival rates typically below 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3121780479\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravesical BCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While further courses of intravesical therapy are not recommended for BCG-unresponsive high-grade T1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer due to the heightened risk of progression, additional intravesical therapy can be considered for intermediate-risk and high-grade <span class=\"nowrap\">Ta/Tis</span> disease after failure of BCG therapy. </p><p>The decision to proceed with cystectomy versus bladder-conserving therapy is guided by the balance between quality of life impairment, and morbidity and mortality of major surgery on the one hand, and the risk of recurrence, progression, and mortality with additional intravesical therapy on the other hand, all in the context of patient choice. There are only limited data on trimodality therapy in this setting, and this is currently the subject of a trial being conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG).</p><p>Although not explicitly endorsed by guidelines, a second course of intravesical therapy is often preferred by patients due to the relatively low risk of immediate progression from high-grade Ta and CIS, compared with the risk associated with radical cystectomy. In a retrospective series, the rates of progression to muscle invasive disease and metastasis after repeat cycles of intravesical therapy in a heterogenous non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patient cohort were 7 and 5 percent after the first cycle, 11 and 14 percent after the second cycle, and 30 and 50 percent after the third cycle, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Many patients are medically unfit for cystectomy, and others refuse the surgery. In all cases, cystectomy has a significant impact on quality of life. The optimal timing of cystectomy due to failure of intravesical therapy is, therefore, controversial. The potential benefits of preserving the bladder must be balanced against the risks of progression to muscle invasive and even metastatic disease, with a resultant decreased survival.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who recur with high-risk disease beyond 12 months after the last dose of intravesical therapy, data from one study suggested that another course of intravesical therapy (preferentially BCG) should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This rule is also often applied to patients with high-grade T1 tumors at the time of recurrence, but as described above, the risk of progression is particularly high in these patients, and cystectomy should always be favored.

Although the guidelines call for cystectomy in this setting, it is generally considered safe in clinical practice to attempt one additional course of intravesical therapy before proceeding to cystectomy.</p><p/><p>A major objective of bladder preservation strategies is to avoid muscle invasive disease.

In a Spanish study, patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer progressed to muscle invasive disease in 3.3 percent of cases at six months and 8 percent at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-persistent-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The mortality from bladder cancer was 0.4 percent at six months, 1.0 percent at one year, and 2.5 percent at 1.5 years. The authors concluded that the risk of death from surgery matched the risk of death from the bladder cancer at 1.5 years.
