It is one of many different types of arthritis. Doctors and nurses do not know what causes it. But they do know that it happens when the body's infection-fighting system, called the immune system, &quot;attacks&quot; the joints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473801970\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I tell whether I have rheumatoid arthritis or another type of arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You cannot tell. Only a doctor or nurse can tell you that. But there are some clues to look for. For instance, rheumatoid arthritis usually starts by affecting the small joints in the fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70434\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70434 \">picture 1</a>), the balls of the feet, and the wrists. It usually affects both the left and the right side at the same time. (Other types of arthritis tend to first affect larger joints, like the knees or hips. And they might affect one side much more than the other.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473801977\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens as rheumatoid arthritis gets worse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though it might start in the fingers and toes, rheumatoid arthritis can affect any of the joints. Sometimes it damages the joints forever. Plus, rheumatoid arthritis can cause problems in other parts of the body, such as the heart, lungs, or eyes. Doctors and nurses have no way of knowing which people will get which symptoms or how bad the symptoms will get.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473801984\"><span class=\"h1\">Get treated early for rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor or nurse tells you that you have rheumatoid arthritis, start treatment right away. Do not wait until your symptoms get worse. Getting treated early can help prevent a lot of the damage the disease can do to your body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473801991\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the treatments for rheumatoid arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are dozens of medicines for rheumatoid arthritis. The right one for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How bad your symptoms are</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many of your joints are affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How your disease has changed over time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What side effects you feel with the medicines you try</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What your X-rays look like</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of certain blood tests</p><p/><p>In general, the treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,&quot; also known as NSAIDs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called steroids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;disease modifying antirheumatic drugs,&quot; also known as &quot;DMARDs&quot;</p><p/><p>People who have severe pain that does not get better with the medicines listed above sometimes get narcotic pain medicines, but that is not usually necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473801998\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It is very important that you stay active. You might want to avoid being active because you are in pain. But that can make things worse. It will make your muscles weak and your joints stiffer than they already are. A physical therapist can help you figure out which exercises will do the most good. An occupational therapist can help you figure out how to keep doing the everyday tasks you need to do &minus; even with arthritis.</p><p>Another thing you can do to on your own is to eat a healthy diet. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at risk for heart disease, so avoid fatty foods. Instead, eats lots of fruits and vegetables.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473802005\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse about it before you start trying. Some of the medicines used to treat rheumatoid arthritis are not safe for a baby, so you might need to switch medicines before you get pregnant. Plus, there are things you should do to help prevent problems during the pregnancy. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis often get a lot better during pregnancy. But they can get worse again after the baby is born.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473802012\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioids-for-short-term-treatment-of-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Opioids for short-term treatment of pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hand-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hand pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Complementary and alternative therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
