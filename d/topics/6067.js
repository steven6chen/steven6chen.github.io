It is often used for the preoperative staging of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies such as esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and rectal cancers for which it has an accuracy of 90, 88, and 90 percent, respectively, when performed with experienced hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-anatomy-of-the-normal-esophagus/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>EUS provides high-resolution imaging of the GI tract by its unique ability to differentiate the histologic layers of the GI tract wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-anatomy-of-the-normal-esophagus/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The most commonly used echoendoscopes operate across a broad range of frequencies ranging from 5 to 20 MHz, with a variable depth of penetration and resolution. These echoendoscopes produce an image of the GI tract wall consisting of five sections or layers. A discussion of high frequency EUS with ranges &gt;20 MHz revealing a nine-layer GI tract wall is covered elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-frequency-catheter-endoscopic-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-frequency catheter endoscopic ultrasonography&quot;</a>). These layers correspond to the five distinct histologic layers of the gut wall:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The innermost, medial layer (lumen) is known as the superficial mucosal layer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second layer corresponds to the lamina propria or deep mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third layer is known as the submucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fourth layer is referred to as the muscularis propria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fifth layer is known as the adventitia in the esophagus and serosa in the stomach, duodenum, and rectum</p><p/><p>Visually, these endosonographic layers appear as five alternating hyperechoic and hypoechoic bands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73301\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73301 \">image 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The innermost layer (lumen) is hyperechoic or echogenic, and is attributed to the initial echo-interface between the ultrasound waves, the GI tract mucosa, and surrounding fluid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second layer is a hypoechoic or dark band that corresponds to the actual mucosa and deep mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third layer is a hyperechoic or bright echo that corresponds to the submucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fourth layer represents the muscularis propria and is depicted as a hypoechoic or dark band</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fifth layer, which is seen as a hyperechoic or bright echogenic band, is considered the serosa in the stomach, duodenum, and rectum and the adventitia in the esophagus</p><p/><p>The cross-sectional anatomy of the GI tract wall seen on EUS corresponds clinically to the tumor, nodal, and metastasis (TNM) staging classification system used to stage the majority of GI tumors. Therefore, EUS has great value in staging GI luminal based tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the EUS anatomy of the esophagus. The role of EUS in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal lesions is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in esophageal carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound for the characterization of subepithelial lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-endoscopic-ultrasound\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic endoscopic ultrasound&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination of the esophagus is one of the easiest EUS procedures to perform, second only to the rectum, since the esophagus is essentially a straight tube requiring little to no manipulation of the echoendoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-anatomy-of-the-normal-esophagus/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. EUS examination resembles standard endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The operator performs the procedure with the patient in a left lateral decubitus position. Echoendoscopes are usually side-viewing and have an ultrasound transducer located at the tip that emits high frequency acoustic waves to the surrounding tissues. The latter permits the acquisition of unique &quot;real-time&quot; views of the gut wall and the surrounding organs and blood vessels.</p><p>&quot;Linear&quot; instruments scan in the same plane as the long axis of the endoscope, whereas mechanical &quot;radial&quot; instruments have a rotating mechanical ultrasound probe that scans in a circle at 90&deg; to the long axis of the endoscope. The ultrasound signal is then integrated by a complex processor and transmitted in real-time to a video screen. Linear instruments are used for EUS-guided fine needle aspiration. This discussion will focus on the anatomical relationships that can be imaged from the esophagus using radial scanning endosonography since most centers with EUS use the radial scanning echoendoscope for GI tumor staging.</p><p>The image obtained with radial EUS is similar to that of a computed tomographic (CT) scan. As a general rule, the upper part of the screen is anterior, and the right part of the screen is to the patient's left side. EUS depends upon a thorough knowledge of the spatial anatomy of the mediastinum relative to the esophagus. This understanding of the anatomy gives the endoscopist the ability to adapt to the many positions or views that can be obtained with the echoendoscope. Furthermore, the anatomic relationships must be retained and integrated for both radial and linear EUS imaging, making EUS a difficult procedure to learn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17495045\"><span class=\"h2\">Stomach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the radial scanning echoendoscope is introduced into the esophagus, it should be advanced slowly into the stomach just past the gastroesophageal junction, which is usually approximately 40 to 45 cm from the incisors. When EUS scanning is initiated, the aorta should be readily seen as an oval shaped, approximately 2 cm hypoechoic structure, positioned between five and six o'clock. If it is not seen, gentle advancement or withdrawal of the instrument will usually bring it into view. The image can be adjusted by rotating the echoendoscope (either manually or electronically) until the aorta is in the five to six o'clock position.</p><p>The aorta can then be traced to the celiac axis, an important anatomical area that needs evaluation for the presence of lymph node metastasis during tumor staging. Positive celiac lymph nodes are an ominous sign since they typically represent M1 or distant metastasis, usually precluding an attempt at curative resection. In most cases, the celiac trunk can be visualized. The hepatic artery can be seen coursing to the right and superiorly, and the splenic artery can be seen coursing to the left. The vascular structures are easily recognized by the experienced endosonographer; however, the novice can take advantage of the Doppler and color flow capability on the linear equipment to visualize these structures. Another benefit of <span class=\"nowrap\">Doppler/color</span> flow is to identify small intramural vessels that might interfere with the safe performance of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal esophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The five-layer wall pattern of the esophagus comes into view as the echoendoscope is slowly withdrawn cephalad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73301\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73301 \">image 1</a>). The normal wall thickness of the esophagus measures 3 to 4 mm. Overinflation of the balloon should be avoided since it can cause imaging artifacts and flatten the wall, making it difficult to clearly discern the five layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-anatomy-of-the-normal-esophagus/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. In addition, air that is not completely suctioned from the lumen will create artifact, making imaging difficult.</p><p>The major anatomical landmarks in the distal esophagus are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aorta, which as previously stated, is located in the five to six o'clock positions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spine, which will be visualized in the seven o'clock position, just adjacent to the aorta.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left lobe of the liver, which is seen between the 6 and 12 o'clock positions. The inferior vena cava and other hepatic structures (ie, hepatic veins and bile ducts) will be frequently noted coursing through this portion of the liver.</p><p/><p>In the distal esophagus, multiple wall layers can sometimes be appreciated in patients with a hiatal hernia. This probably occurs as a result of simultaneous imaging of the hiatal hernia and cardia of the stomach. More accurate imaging of this area and the distal esophageal wall can be achieved by instilling small amounts of water into this region, which can help open up the folds within the hiatal hernia.</p><p>During withdrawal of the echoendoscope, the heart, specifically the left atrium, will begin to come into view in the twelve o'clock position. Upon further interrogation of this area, the left pulmonary artery can be seen as it heads posteriorly to the left of the ascending aorta, and the pulmonary veins can be seen entering the left atrium. The mitral valve leaflets can sometimes be imaged; the valves are seen opening from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle are more difficult to image and may not be seen distinctly in all cases since they are situated posterior to the left atrium.</p><p>As the echoendoscope is further withdrawn, small pericardial effusions may be seen below the heart. At this point, the left lung will begin to appear at the two o'clock position while the right lung can be seen in the nine o'clock location. The lungs have a unique EUS image of hyperechoic rings that represents air within the lung parenchyma. Further withdrawal of the instrument will begin imaging structures surrounding the mid-esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mid-esophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major anatomical landmarks of the mid-esophagus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aorta again located at the five to six o'clock positions, which then evolves into the aortic arch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spine at the seven o'clock position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The azygous vein at the eight o'clock position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thoracic duct</p><p/><p>Keeping the aorta in the five to six o'clock position, the spine will remain visualized at the seven o'clock position. The azygous vein will be seen to the right of the aorta and will move anterior to the spine and upwards along the right lung. The thoracic duct will occasionally be seen as a small, round anechoic dot to the left of the aorta. As the scope is withdrawn further, the azygous vein will be seen moving forward and merging into the superior vena cava. The aortic arch will be noted on the left as it arises from the aorta and can be seen curving towards the right. Also, the left and right bronchi can be seen as small hyperechoic rings that represent cartilage and air, at the one o'clock and eleven o'clock positions, respectively.</p><p>As the echoendoscope is withdrawn, the left and right bronchi can be observed forming the trachea at the level of the hilum, which is usually about 26 to 28 cm from the incisors. Just below this region lies the subcarina where one can frequently encounter benign mediastinal lymph nodes. These lymph nodes characteristically appear as hyperechoic structures with indistinct margins and irregular shapes (ie, oblong, rectangular, and triangular). In cases of malignant nodes, more distinct and sharper borders and a round shape are typical. Benign lymph nodes are usually less than 1 cm in size. However, these nodes can be enlarged in patients with previous mediastinal infections, such as histoplasmosis, or even sarcoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal esophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proximal or cervical esophagus is entered upon further withdrawal of the instrument. In this position, the blood vessels of the neck come into view, while the aortic arch falls below the imaging plane. The subclavian artery can be seen posteriorly while the left common carotid artery and sometimes the brachiocephalic trunk are seen anteriorly.</p><p>The location of the trachea in the mid-plane causes artifacts arising from the trachea itself, and from air within its lumen, which can hamper imaging at this station. In some patients, the thyroid gland can be seen, appearing as a hypoechoic structure in the center of the image. Less commonly, the thymus gland, which lies distal to the thyroid near the clavicle, can be seen.</p><p>As the instrument is further withdrawn to near the upper esophageal sphincter (approximately 18 to 20 cm), the patient will become uncomfortable and imaging will be difficult, as a result of patient intolerance and air artifact from the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-anatomy-of-the-normal-esophagus/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. However, in some patients the carotid arteries and internal jugular veins can be imaged. At this point, the balloon should be deflated, the transducer should be stopped, and the scope gently removed from the patient's mouth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While EUS of the esophagus is generally safe, complications can occur from moderate sedation, therapeutic interventions, or passage of the echoendoscope.
