This is achieved by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl carrier in the luminal membrane in this segment, thereby minimizing the entry of luminal sodium into the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The loop diuretics are highly protein-bound and therefore enter the urine primarily by tubular secretion in the proximal tubule, rather than by glomerular filtration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The effect of the loop diuretics is dose dependent, being determined largely by the rate at which the diuretic is delivered to its site of action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67654 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No diuresis is seen with very low doses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A progressively increasing diuresis is achieved at higher doses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A plateau is reached at which even higher doses produce no further diuresis; this dose is called the maximum effective dose, which increases with worsening renal function </p><p/><p>Patients with generalized edema (due for example to heart failure, the nephrotic syndrome, or renal disease) are typically treated with daily therapy. At a given dose, net sodium loss occurs for only one to two weeks before a new steady state is achieved; in this setting, sodium intake and excretion are again equal as the effect of the diuretic is balanced by activation of counterregulatory factors that promote sodium retention, such as the renin-angiotensin system. However, selected patients with mild edema who comply with dietary sodium restriction can be treated with intermittent therapy as needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=time-course-of-loop-and-thiazide-diuretic-induced-electrolyte-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Time course of loop and thiazide diuretic-induced electrolyte complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most commonly used loop diuretics are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, which are sulfonamide derivatives. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ethacrynic acid</a> is rarely used because it may be more ototoxic than the sulfonamide diuretics in high doses, and its relative insolubility makes it cumbersome to administer intravenously.

If furosemide is given orally, this maximum dose is usually twice the intravenous dose (80 mg) since its bioavailability is only about 50 percent, although there is substantial interpatient and intrapatient variability in the degree of bioavailability of oral furosemide. The equivalent maximal doses are 1 mg for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> and 15 to 20 mg for either oral or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> since these agents are almost completely absorbed. All of the loop diuretics produce the same response if given at equipotent doses. Going above these maximum doses will produce little or no further diuresis but may increase the risk of side effects. </p><p>The maximum effective diuretic dose differs in patients with heart failure, advanced cirrhosis, or renal failure. In these settings, decreased renal perfusion (and therefore decreased drug delivery to the kidney), diminished proximal secretion (due to the retention of competing anions in renal failure), and enhanced activity of sodium-retaining forces (such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) singly or in combination can diminish the diuretic effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67654 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In general, the maximal effective intravenous doses in these disorders are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cirrhosis with a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &ndash; 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, 1 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>, or 10 to 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In heart failure with a relatively normal GFR &ndash; 40 to 80 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, 2 to 3 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>, or 20 to 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>.

A slower rate of drug absorption also occurs in patients with advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], a setting in which overly rapid diuresis may be a concern.

However, the efficacy of such an approach has not been proven.

In contrast, bolus therapy is associated with initially higher and then lower rates of diuretic excretion; as a result, sodium excretion may be at near maximal levels for the first two hours but then gradually falls until the next dose is given (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75714\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75714 \">figure 2</a>). If a continuous infusion is used, it is important to begin with a bolus to determine that the patient is diuretic-responsive and to quickly achieve therapeutic drug concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

These include hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, signs of decreased tissue perfusion such as hypotension and elevations in the blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentration, hyperuricemia, and hyponatremia (primarily due to hypovolemia-induced release of antidiuretic hormone).

Patients who develop such reactions can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethacrynic acid</a>, which is not a sulfonamide. Ethacrynic acid is rarely used in the absence of this indication because it may be more ototoxic than the sulfonamide diuretics in high doses, and its relative insolubility makes it cumbersome to administer intravenously.</p><p>A separate issue is the risk of an allergic reaction to the sulfonamide-based loop diuretics in patients with known sulfonamide antibiotic allergy. There is minimal evidence of allergic cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antimicrobials and non-antimicrobials. Thus, patients with a history of allergy to sulfonamide antimicrobial drugs would be expected to tolerate non-antimicrobial sulfonamides such as loop diuretics. Allergic reactions that do occur appear to be related to a predisposition to allergic reactions rather than sulfonamide cross-reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Sodium excretion is determined largely by the rate at which the diuretic is delivered to its site of action in the tubular lumen: no diuresis is seen with very low doses, whereas an increasing effect is achieved at higher doses. A plateau is eventually reached in which even higher doses produce no further diuresis; this dose is called the maximum effective dose.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diuresis related'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, which are sulfonamides, can cause hypersensitivity reactions, usually manifested as a rash or rarely acute interstitial nephritis, similar to those produced by other sulfonamide drugs. Patients who develop such reactions can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethacrynic acid</a>, which is not a sulfonamide. <br/><br/>There is minimal evidence of allergic cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antimicrobials and non-antimicrobials. Thus, patients with a history of allergy to sulfonamide antimicrobial drugs would be expected to tolerate non-antimicrobial sulfonamides such as loop diuretics. Allergic reactions that do occur appear to be related to a predisposition to allergic reactions rather than sulfonamide cross-reactivity. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hypersensitivity reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loop diuretic-induced ototoxicity, which can lead to deafness that may be permanent, primarily occurs with high-dose intravenous therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> doses above 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span> or at lower doses in patients with renal failure or concurrent aminoglycoside therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ethacrynic acid</a>, which is now rarely used, may be more ototoxic in high doses than furosemide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>.
