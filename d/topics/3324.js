CAE is one of the most common forms of pediatric epilepsy.</p><p>TAS manifest as episodes of sudden, profound impairment of consciousness without loss of body tone. They are characteristically provoked by hyperventilation and correspond with generalized 2.5 to 5 Herz spike wave activity on electroencephalogram (EEG). Seizures may be subtle and often go unnoticed for prolonged periods, even with multiple seizures per day.</p><p>In most cases, TAS are the only seizure type observed in CAE, and they respond well to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethosuximide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ethosuximide</a> as well as other broad spectrum antiseizure drugs. CAE remits by early puberty in most patients without major sequelae, although persistent cognitive or psychiatric comorbidities may be present in some children.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of CAE are discussed here. Other epilepsy syndromes with an onset in childhood are discussed separately.

In a retrospective analysis of EEG findings of Swedish children aged 0 to 15 years, the annual incidence of &ldquo;absence epilepsy&rdquo; was 6.3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In another report based on a questionnaire sent to patients with seizures in south-West France, the annual incidence of CAE was estimated at 8 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. CAE accounted for 12 percent of epilepsy diagnoses in one prospective community-based study that included 613 children with epilepsy aged 0 to 16 years, making it one of the most common forms of pediatric epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>CAE is one of the rare epilepsy syndromes in which prevalence is higher in girls than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785435\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is classified as an epilepsy syndrome with presumed genetic cause according to the current International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In previous versions of the classification system, CAE was referred to as an idiopathic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A genetic cause has been suggested by family and twin studies, although clear single-gene defects that reliably result in a typical CAE phenotype have not yet been identified. Family studies indicate a 17 percent risk of having typical absence seizures (TAS) in first-degree relatives of patients with CAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and there is a higher concordance rate for CAE in monozygotic than dizygotic pairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Several candidate regions and genes have been identified as possible susceptibility loci in CAE. Copy number variations and microdeletions in regions such as 8q and 15q have been reported in a minority of patients with generalized epilepsy syndromes, including some with CAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. One group performed sequencing of the 15q candidate region in 380 patients with CAE and identified heterozygous point mutations in<em> NIPA2</em>, a gene that encodes for a selective magnesium transporter, in 3 of 380 patients with CAE and in none of the 400 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Most of the genes otherwise reported code for various subunits of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-22</a>], GABA-B receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>], calcium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/20,23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23-28</a>], or chloride channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], although validation has generally been lacking and ethnic variation may contribute to the heterogeneity in findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/21,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31-34</a>].</p><p>Another gene of interest in CAE is <em>SLC2A1</em>, which encodes the type 1 glucose transporter (GLUT1). Mutations in <em>SLC2A1</em> were found in up to 10 to 12 percent of children presenting with absence epilepsy starting before four years or refractory absences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. In contrast, no <em>SLC2A1</em> mutations were found in 84 subjects with CAE as defined by the onset of absences after four years, documented electroclinical TAS with generalized 3 to 4 Hz spike wave and normal background EEG activity, normal neurodevelopmental examination, and normal brain imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4002033\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in humans and rodent models have implicated a variety of cortical and thalamocortical circuits in the genesis of typical absence seizures (TAS).</p><p>Most data point to prominent involvement of deep layers of the frontal and somatosensory cortex in the generation of slow wave discharges, with rapid spread to other regions of the cortex and secondary invasion of the thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. The orbital-medial frontal and medial-lateral parietal cortices have been implicated in studies utilizing simultaneous EEG and functional MRI during typical slow wave discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In another study, the posterior cortical regions were active at the onset of the slow wave discharge, followed by spread to other areas later in the seizure, including the thalamic medial dorsal nuclei and the thalamostriate network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Animal data indicate that particular cortical and thalamic excitability and coupling conditions must occur to produce the slow wave discharges of TAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Enhanced tonic gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptor inhibition in thalamocortical neurons has been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for the expression of TAS in various pharmacologic and genetic mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Such inhibition is due to increased extracellular GABA concentrations related to dysfunction of GAT-1, an astrocytic transporter involved in GABA synaptic uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785443\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1598235\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The median age of onset of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The majority of patients present between four and ten years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Up to 20 percent of children have a history of febrile seizures and nearly half have a first- or second-degree relative with seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6941749\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizure semiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark seizure type of CAE is the typical absence seizure (TAS). TAS present as short and frequent episodes of profound impairment of consciousness without loss of body tone, lasting about 10 seconds. They are abrupt in onset and termination and easily provoked by hyperventilation. These typically come to the attention of parents or teachers after a prolonged period of observation, despite their high frequency. TAS may occur tens of times daily, but their subtle clinical symptoms allow them to go unnoticed or misdiagnosed as inattention.</p><p>The electroclinical spectrum of TAS in CAE is illustrated by two studies that reviewed a combined total of over 2000 absence seizures in more than 450 drug-na&iuml;ve children with a new diagnosis of CAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Earliest clinical sign &ndash; Approximately half of all recorded seizures begin with an arrest in activity, which is typically complete. Less common first signs include eyelid movements, eye opening, and oral automatisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ictal signs and symptoms &ndash; The majority of electrographic seizures (approximately 80 percent) are associated with at least one clinical sign. The three most common seizure features are <span class=\"nowrap\">pause/stare</span> (80 to 95 percent), motor automatisms (40 to 60 percent), and eye involvement (55 percent). About one-third of seizures involve three hertz (Hz) regular eyelid movements. Motor automatisms are predominantly oral.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure duration &ndash; The average seizure duration is 9 to 10 seconds. Approximately 25 percent of seizures last less than four seconds and approximately 10 percent are longer than 20 seconds.</p><p/><p>Hyperventilation is an effective trigger of TAS, provoking seizures in 90 percent of children old enough to perform the maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. TAS are not provoked by sensory or visual stimuli.</p><p>The presence of violent limb myoclonias, head nods, hypotonia, or focal signs are not consistent with TAS and should raise suspicion for other types of seizures, such as atypical absences or focal seizures. In addition, atypical absences should be suspected if the duration of the events exceeds the classic 10 to 20 seconds of TAS, especially if onset and termination are progressive rather than abrupt. (See <a href=\"#H383785503\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Other seizure types are rare in CAE. Although generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) have been reported in up to 60 percent of children in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/5,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,49</a>], the true proportion is likely much lower when stringent diagnostic criteria for CAE are used. In two contemporary long-term follow studies of children with CAE, only 12 to 13 percent of children with CAE developed GTCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. In the larger series, the median time to development of GTCS was 4.7 years, and the median age at first GTCS was 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. GTCS rarely occur before puberty in CAE, and their presence during the active TAS stage of CAE is sometimes considered exclusionary for the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H383785497\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785455\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognition and behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with CAE typically have intact cognition and intellect at the time of diagnosis, although formal neurocognitive testing may detect mild deficits in a variety of domains, particularly executive function. This is illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that compared neuropsychological and academic function in 94 children aged 8 to 18 years with new-onset epilepsy to 72 healthy subjects, specific difficulties in fine motor skills and executive functions were noted in children with both childhood and juvenile absence epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small study that included 16 children with CAE, 14 children with type 1 diabetes, and 15 healthy controls, children with CAE performed similarly to other groups on measures of global intellectual function, memory, and academic achievement but had significantly more executive dysfunction, as measured by deficits in problem solving, letter fluency, complex motor control, <span class=\"nowrap\">attention/behavioral</span> inhibition, and psychosocial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a larger study that examined behavioral, cognitive, and linguistic comorbidities in 69 children with CAE and 103 age-matched healthy subjects, children with CAE had significantly lower scores on global, verbal, and performance intellectual quotients and speech language quotients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p>Similar findings have also been reported in children with other generalized epilepsy syndromes that are typically associated with a favorable prognosis. In these studies, cognitive, social, emotional or psychiatric comorbidities frequently antedate the epilepsy onset and require special educational interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/53-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785461\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychiatric comorbidities are common in children with CAE. In a study that included 69 children with CAE, 61 percent had a psychiatric diagnosis (mostly attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] or anxiety), and 33 percent had behavioral or social problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Other studies have also reported higher rates of ADHD, anxiety, depression, social isolation, and low self-esteem in patients with CAE compared with healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In a large randomized trial that included nearly 450 children with newly diagnosed CAE, 36 percent of children had baseline attention deficits despite intact cognitive functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>ADHD appears to be a core feature of CAE in many children and is not simply the result of frequent seizures. The pattern of deficits tends to be more inattentive than hyperactive, which can make recognition of the deficits difficult for teachers and parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Seizure duration rather than overall seizure frequency is one predictor of attentional dysfunction, but additional risk factors are not well established. In the randomized study mentioned above, the rate of subtle attentional difficulties was higher in the 30 percent of children who had at least one seizure longer than 20 seconds on initial EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In the same study, overall number of seizures was not associated with measures of attention or executive function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454490283\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EEG in patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) should be a sleep-deprived video-EEG study that includes both intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) and hyperventilation (HV) in order to maximize the chance of recording an absence seizure.</p><p>Among 47 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CAE, diagnostic 30-minute sleep-deprived video EEG recordings captured an average of 6 seizures per child; of these, 47 percent occurred with HV, 25 percent during drowsiness, 13 percent during the awake state, 9 percent during IPS, and 7 percent during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. At least one seizure was provoked during HV in 83 percent of children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785479\"><span class=\"h2\">Interictal EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interictal EEG in CAE shows normal background activity, although it is common to see occasional generalized spike wave discharges or focal abnormalities. In a review 445 pre-treatment EEGs, occipital rhythmic delta activity (OIRDA) was noted in 21 percent, focal sharp waves in 2.5 percent, and focal slowing in 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In another study, focal intermittent paroxysmal activity was noted in 38 percent of 29 children with CAE, consisting in most cases of frontal spike wave or polyspike and wave discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785485\"><span class=\"h2\">Ictal EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The EEG appearance of a typical absence seizure (TAS) consists of generalized 2.5 to 5 Herz (Hz) spike wave discharges (classically, 3 Hz) with abrupt onset and termination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91022\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef91022 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Spike wave discharges are frequently disorganized, and pre- and post-ictal slowing is often present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The morphologic characteristics of the spike wave discharges vary across recordings. In one study, 87 percent of spike wave discharges contained only one or two spikes per wave during the seizure; four or more spikes per wave were present in 8 percent of the 47 children when analyzed individually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In another study, single spike wave discharges were noted in 604 of 721 discharges (84 percent), whereas polyspike wave discharges were present in only 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>In up to 50 percent of cases, the earliest ictal abnormalities are focal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This is often predominant in the frontal leads bilaterally, a phenomenon referred to as &quot;frontal lead-in&quot; or &quot;frontal absences&quot; by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Similar features have also been reported arising from the occipital lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The ictal EEG of atypical absences usually shows discharges of irregular generalized spike waves of lower frequency (&lt; 2.5 Hz) than those observed in TAS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50497\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50497 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785491\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROIMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is by definition normal in patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and structural imaging is not necessary for the diagnosis if patients have typical clinical and EEG findings.</p><p>High-resolution structural imaging has been used to demonstrate subtle anatomical variation in various brain regions in patients with CAE, although the functional and clinical significance of these findings is uncertain. Reported abnormalities include decreased thalamic grey matter volume and subcallosal gyrus atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], grey matter loss in the left orbital-frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], and amygdala volume loss in CAE patients with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785497\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and video-EEG findings. The most widely accepted diagnostic criteria were proposed by Panayiotopoulos in 1997 and accepted by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/5,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,70</a>].</p><p>According to these criteria, a diagnosis of CAE requires all of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at onset of 4 to 10 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal neurological and developmental state</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brief (4 to 20 seconds) and frequent (tens per day) absence seizures, with abrupt and severe loss of consciousness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized rhythmic spikes or double spike wave discharges at around 3 Hz</p><p/><p>In addition, the following criteria are exclusionary for the diagnosis of CAE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other seizure types preceding or observed during the active stage of typical absence seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive and sustained eyelid, perioral, head or limb myoclonias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild or no impairment of consciousness during the spike wave discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spike wave discharges of less than 4 seconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 3 spikes or spike wave fragmentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual or other sensory seizure precipitants</p><p/><p>Of note, some authors in the field consider these criteria as too strict, given the significant demographic, clinical and electroencephalographic heterogeneity demonstrated in at least one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, children with TAS beginning before the age of three who otherwise fulfill the above criteria may show a similarly favorable clinical course as those with CAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383785503\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the differential diagnosis of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is to identify the nature of the paroxysmal events and determine whether they are electroclinical typical absence seizures (TAS) or nonepileptic staring spells. This is usually easy to do, and often only requires a short video-EEG recording [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Non-epileptic staring spells can occur in normal children as well as in association with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and mental retardation. Unlike TAS, staring spells can be interrupted by tactile or vocal stimulation, rarely occur during physical activity, and are never associated with automatisms or other motor signs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Nonepileptic staring spells'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to CAE, TAS may be seen in other generalized epilepsy syndromes, including juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), as well as rare cases of type 1 glucose transporter (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Juvenile absence epilepsy</strong> &ndash; JAE is a generalized epilepsy also characterized by TAS but with a later peak age of onset of 10 to 12 years.

Much of the variability likely relates to differences in diagnostic classification over the years, however, and the inclusion of patients who ultimately go on to have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) or other syndromes associated with lower rates of seizure remission. Strict use of the 2005 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria may identify a more homogeneous subgroup of patients with an excellent prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>In one study that included 72 children initially diagnosed with CAE, approximately two-thirds of patients were seizure free at a minimum follow up of nine years after seizure onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Seventeen percent were still having seizures but did not take medications. Forty-four percent of patients not in remission had progressed to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Significant factors predicting no remission included cognitive difficulties at onset, absence status epilepticus before or during drug treatment, generalized tonic clonic or myoclonic seizures after treatment onset, abnormal background on initial EEG, and a history of generalized seizures in first-degree relatives.</p><p>In another study, over 90 percent of children with CAE diagnosed according to the 1989 ILAE classification were seizure free after a mean follow-up of 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Those who fulfilled the 2005 criteria had fewer generalized tonic clonic seizures, but their final overall outcome was not significantly different than those who did not. The total duration of epilepsy and the mean age at final remission were 3.9 and 9.5 years, respectively. Epilepsy duration was longer in those children who had become seizure-free more than six months after treatment initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>A relatively small proportion of children with typical absence seizures are refractory to typical therapeutic approaches for a prolonged period. In one study of 92 such children with refractory typical absence seizures, approximately 50 percent eventually achieved prolonged seizure freedom with or without antiseizure drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-absence-epilepsy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Despite favorable rates of seizure freedom by adolescence, psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities are common in children with CAE and can persist even in the absence of ongoing seizures.

It is one of the most common forms of pediatric epilepsy, accounting for approximately 12 percent of all cases of childhood-onset epilepsy. In contrast with most pediatric epilepsy syndromes, the prevalence of CAE is higher in girls than in boys. (See <a href=\"#H383785429\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CAE is classified as an epilepsy syndrome with presumed genetic cause according to the current International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification system. A genetic cause has been suggested by family and twin studies, although clear single-gene defects that reliably result in CAE have not yet been identified.

TAS are frequently associated with early arrest in activity, staring, repetitive eyelid movements, and automatisms. (See <a href=\"#H6941749\" class=\"local\">'Seizure semiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although children with CAE typically have normal development and intellect, formal neurocognitive testing may detect mild deficits in a variety of domains, particularly executive function.
