Respiratory insufficiency leading to respiratory arrest typically precedes cardiac arrest for most children. Survival rates between 43 and 82 percent have been reported for children who have been resuscitated from respiratory arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. By contrast, between 4 and 14 percent of children who go on to develop cardiac arrest survive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clear, patent airway is a fundamental requirement for effective resuscitation. Anatomic features that make the airways of infants and children more susceptible to obstruction and that must be considered in order to maintain an adequate airway include the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;, section on 'Anatomic considerations'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The position of the larynx in infants and children is higher and more anterior than in adults. As a result, hyperextension of the neck may worsen obstruction of the upper airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the airways of children are smaller, they are more susceptible to obstruction from edema, mucous plugs, or foreign body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relatively larger occiput causes passive flexion of the cervical spine in the supine position, which contributes to a tendency for the posterior pharynx to buckle during resuscitation. This can be prevented by maintaining the head in the sniffing position. Placing a rolled towel under the child's occiput or upper shoulders may help to maintain proper positioning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common cause of airway obstruction in the unresponsive child is the tongue, which is relatively larger compared to the oral cavity in the child than in the adult and can fall back against the hypopharynx in a child with a decreased level of consciousness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINVASIVE RELIEF OF OBSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chin-lift <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> jaw-thrust maneuvers should be performed to open the airway in an unresponsive child before any more invasive airway adjuncts are utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These maneuvers place the airway in a neutral position and move the tongue and palatal tissues away from the posterior wall of the pharynx. In-line immobilization of the cervical spine is essential during these procedures if trauma is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The placement of an airway adjunct such as a nasopharyngeal or oral airway may be necessary if neither the chin-lift nor the jaw thrust maneuvers open the airway. The indications and procedures for placement of these airways are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Airway adjuncts'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chin lift</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this technique, the fingers of one hand are placed under the mandible, which is gently lifted upward to move the chin anteriorly. The thumb of the same hand lightly depresses the lower lip to open the mouth. The thumb may also be placed behind the lower incisors to gently lift the chin so that the lower central incisors are anterior to the maxillary central incisors. One hand may be placed on the child's forehead to gently tilt the head into a neutral position if there is no suspicion of neck injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61533 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70710\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70710 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>During the chin lift procedure, care must be taken to avoid closing the mouth, pushing on the soft tissues under the chin, or hyperextending the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73382\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73382 \">figure 2</a>) since these actions contribute to airway obstruction.</p><p>The head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver should <strong>not</strong> be used in children who are suspected of having head or neck injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Jaw thrust</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The jaw thrust is the preferred method for opening the airway when trauma is suspected, in which case, cervical spine immobilization should also be maintained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;, section on 'Motion restriction during airway management'</a>.)</p><p>It is also useful when assisted ventilation with a bag-valve-mask is required. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Bag-mask ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p>The jaw thrust maneuver is performed by grasping the angles of the lower jaw with one hand on each side, and moving the mandible forward so that the lower central incisors are anterior to the upper central incisors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51547\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51547 \">picture 2</a>). With no evidence of cervical spine injury, a slight head tilt may be added when the jaw thrust alone does not restore airway patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway adjuncts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral and nasopharyngeal airways may be useful to improve ventilation, particularly when oropharyngeal structures, such as the tongue, are obstructing the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An oral airway can be used in an unconscious child to lift the tongue and pharyngeal soft tissues off of the posterior pharynx to maintain a patent airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50230\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50230 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Direct contact with the tongue and supraglottic structures may stimulate vomiting.</p><p>An oral airway is optimally used as a bridge to recovery for a patient whose condition is expected to be temporary (such as a child who is post-ictal or recovering from sedation). However, prolonged tolerance of an oral airway usually suggests the need for endotracheal (ET) intubation.</p><p>Selection of the appropriate size and careful placement are necessary to use this device effectively and safely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. To choose the correctly sized oral airway, hold it along the side of the child's face with the flange at the corner of the mouth. The tip of the airway should reach the angle of the mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77645\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77645 \">picture 4</a>). It should be inserted using a tongue depressor to push the tongue to the floor of the mouth to avoid pushing the device into the base of the tongue, thereby obstructing the child's airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasopharyngeal airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A flexible nasal airway bypasses obstruction caused by the tongue and pharyngeal soft tissues with minimal contact with the tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is much less likely to induce emesis than an oral airway and is frequently tolerated by conscious patients. </p><p>Thus, this device is particularly useful for children with soft tissue upper airway obstruction such as macroglossia or tonsillar hypertrophy, who have normal mentation and respiratory function.</p><p>For nasal trumpets without an adjustable flange (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69419 \">picture 5</a>), the correctly sized nasal airway is more accurately determined by the length of the device rather than by the bore. The distance from the patient&rsquo;s nostril to the tragus has been shown to correlate well with the length from the nostril to the vocal cords in normal children and is our preferred method for sizing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Alternatively, the distance from the nostril to the mandible may be used. However, the accuracy of this method has not been studied. </p><p>For nasal trumpets with an adjustable flange, the bore can be chosen to match the size of the nares, and the cuff adjusted to the proper length. The bore should be large enough to avoid obstruction by secretions but small enough to permit atraumatic passage and to avoid pressure necrosis of the nasal mucosa. &#160;</p><p>The nasal airway should be well-lubricated and gently inserted into the nostril to avoid bleeding from injury to nasal mucosa or adenoidal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79849 \">picture 6</a>). The bevel of the airway should face the nasal septum to minimize obstruction of the tip with nasal pharyngeal mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the airway has been secured, if the child is not breathing spontaneously, the rescuer should administer two breaths. Each breath should be given over one second [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Breaths may be administered using mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mouth-and-nose, mouth-to-nose techniques, or with bag-mask ventilation. </p><p>Chest compressions should also be initiated when there is no pulse or the heart rate is &lt;60 beats per minute. Under these circumstances, one cycle of compressions should precede the first breaths. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric basic life support for health care providers&quot;, section on 'Basic life support algorithms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following general principles should be applied no matter which method of ventilation is used (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers#H203491055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric basic life support for health care providers&quot;, section on 'Ventilation'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rescue breathing is performed while maintaining the airway with the chin lift or jaw thrust. Only the jaw thrust maneuver should be performed in patients with head or neck trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rescuer administers two slow breaths, delivering each breath over one second. There should be a short pause between breaths to maximize oxygen content and minimize carbon dioxide concentration in the delivered breaths &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume that is delivered should be sufficient to make the chest wall rise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rescue breaths in perfusing patients who have inadequate breathing should be provided every three to five seconds (12 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the timing of rescue breaths depends on whether or not the trachea is intubated:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For lone rescuers, two ventilations should be delivered during a short pause at the end of every 30<sup>th</sup> compression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For two rescuers, two ventilations should be delivered at the end of every 15<sup>th</sup> compression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once the trachea is intubated, ventilations and compressions can be performed independently. For infants and children, ventilations are given at a rate of 8 to 10 per minute. Compressions are delivered at a rate of 100 per minute without pauses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Coordination of compression and ventilation may be facilitated by counting compressions aloud or using an audio-prompted rate guide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Rescue breathing, particularly if performed rapidly, may cause gastric distention. This can interfere with effective rescue breathing by elevating the diaphragm and compromising lung expansion. Gastric distention can be minimized by giving rescue breaths slowly, which allows an effective tidal volume to be delivered at a lower inspiratory pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When two rescuers are present, cricoid pressure may be applied to compress the esophagus, thereby reducing gastric distension. Evidence that compression of the esophagus decreases the risk of regurgitation and aspiration is limited. Care must be taken not to obstruct the airway if the technique is applied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach#H1519186975\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;, section on 'External laryngeal manipulation (bimanual laryngoscopy)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Mouth-to-mouth/nose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A barrier should be used for infection control whenever possible during mouth-to mouth, mouth-to-mouth-and-nose, and mouth-to-nose breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In mouth-to-mouth breathing (for victims older than one year of age), the rescuer takes a deep breath and places his or her mouth over the victim's mouth to create a tight seal, while pinching the victim's nose closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. For victims younger than one year, the rescuer takes a deep breath and places his or her mouth over the victim's mouth and nose.</p><p>Mouth-to-nose breathing is a reasonable alternative to mouth-to- mouth-and-nose breathing for infants younger than one year of age. When the mouth-to-nose technique is used, it is necessary for the rescuer to close the infant's mouth during rescue breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Bag-mask ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers who are properly trained can use a bag and mask device to provide ventilation during pediatric resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Furthermore, the use of bag-mask ventilation rather than endotracheal intubation during cardiac arrest has been associated with higher survival in children treated in both the prehospital and hospital settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric basic life support for health care providers&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and survival'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care#H2113991\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric considerations in prehospital care&quot;, section on 'Pediatric procedures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Bag</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of ventilation bags are available, flow-inflating (anesthesia) or self-inflating bags. The self-inflating bag is generally preferred for resuscitation. Advantages of this device include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The self-inflating bag reinflates when it is released and does not require a gas source to deliver breaths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The self-inflating bag is easier to use. When compared to the flow-inflating bag, effective bag-mask ventilation can be performed more reliably by health care providers with variable levels of expertise using the self-inflating device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p>Unlike the flow-inflating bag, the self-inflating ventilation bag requires an oxygen reservoir system to reliably deliver oxygen concentrations above 40 percent. This is because room air is entrained in the system when the bag reinflates. With an oxygen flow rate of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min,</span> oxygen concentrations between 95 and 100 percent can be delivered using a 2.5 L bag reservoir system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Less oxygen is delivered at higher ventilation rates.</p><p>Self-inflating ventilation bags typically have a safety pop-off valve that reduces the risk of barotrauma by limiting peak inspiratory pressures to between 35 and 45 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. However, higher levels of peak inspiratory pressure may be required to provide adequate tidal volume and oxygenation when airway resistance is high or lung compliance is poor. In this situation, the pop-off valve can usually be disabled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Whenever possible, a manometer should be used to monitor peak inspiratory pressure when the pop-off valve is disabled. Clinicians should be familiar with the type of ventilation bags that are used in their facilities.</p><p>The ventilation bag should have a minimum volume of 450 to 500 mL, even for newly born full-term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Mask</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective bag-mask ventilation requires a mask that fits properly. The correct size is the smallest mask that completely covers the victim's mouth and nose without covering the eyes or overlapping the chin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76143 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">E-C clamp technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &quot;E-C clamp technique&quot; has been described by the American Heart Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Utilizing this method, the rescuer can optimally position the airway to deliver effective breaths, while applying the mask tightly to the victim's face to avoid air leaks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55539\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55539 \">picture 8</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maneuvers to relieve airway obstruction include chin lift and jaw thrust (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61533 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53277\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53277 \">figure 3</a>). Chin lift should <strong>not</strong> be used for patients with suspected cervical spine injury. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive relief of obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral and nasopharyngeal airways may be useful to improve ventilation, particularly when oropharyngeal structures, such as the tongue, are obstructing the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77645\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77645 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69419 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79849 \">picture 6</a>). Oral airways are appropriate for unconscious patients. Nasopharyngeal airways are particularly useful for children with soft tissue upper airway obstruction such as macroglossia or tonsillar hypertrophy, who have normal mentation and respiratory function. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Airway adjuncts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the airway has been secured, if the child is not breathing spontaneously, the rescuer should administer two breaths. Each breath should be given over one second. Breaths may be administered using mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mouth-and-nose, mouth-to-nose techniques, or with bag-mask ventilation. Chest compressions should be initiated when there is no pulse or the heart rate is &lt;60 beats per minute. Under these circumstances, one cycle of compressions should precede the first breaths. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rescue breathing is performed while maintaining the airway with the chin lift or jaw thrust. Only the jaw thrust maneuver should be performed in patients with head or neck trauma. For patients in cardiac arrest, the ratio of ventilations to compressions varies according to the number of rescuers and whether or not the trachea is intubated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilations should be delivered with sufficient pressure and volume to see the chest wall rise. Hyperventilation and gastric extension can be minimized by delivering ventilations slowly (over one second) and with only enough force and tidal volume required to make the chest wall visibly rise. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The E-C clamp technique is a useful method for bag-mask ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55539\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55539 \">picture 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Bag-mask ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor chest wall movement suggests inadequate ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring adequacy of ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> &mdash; The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Pamela Bailey, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-airway-management-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">L&oacute;pez-Herce J, Garc&iacute;a C, Dom&iacute;nguez P, et al.
