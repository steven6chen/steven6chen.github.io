Intralesional injections are effective for a wide range of indications, are easily performed, and are relatively safe.</p><p>The rationale for intralesional therapy is simple: to deliver a medication directly into a specific skin lesion to treat local tissues with minimal systemic effects. The skin also serves as a reservoir, allowing medication deposited in the dermis to be delivered over a period of time, resulting in prolonged therapy while avoiding or minimizing the adverse effects of systemic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRALESIONAL DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The drugs primarily used for intralesional injections are corticosteroids, but in recent years <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, 5-fluorouracil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, and interferons also have been dispensed in this manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This review is limited to the use of intralesional corticosteroids.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamcinolone</a> acetonide and triamcinolone diacetate are the most widely used intralesional corticosteroids, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> are used by some clinicians. Triamcinolone agents are available as micronized suspensions. Characteristics associated with micronized suspensions that make them desirable as intralesional corticosteroids are the small size of the corticosteroid particles, the persistence of small crystal size for extended periods of time, and that the process of gently shaking resuspends the drug evenly in solution. Small corticosteroid crystals are more efficiently delivered to the treatment site, thereby decreasing the total administered dose of the drug and reducing the risk of systemic side effects and skin atrophy. In addition, because micronized crystals of corticosteroid are in a depot form, the active ingredients are stored in the tissues and released over a period of weeks, making this type of corticosteroid delivery system well suited for the treatment of chronic inflammatory dermatoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Examples of chronic inflammatory dermatoses that are particularly amenable to this type of extended action include psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and prurigo nodularis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for intralesional corticosteroid therapy are acute and chronic inflammatory processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], hyperplastic and hypertrophic skin disorders, and conditions that typically have a favorable response to systemic and topical corticosteroids. In addition to anti-inflammatory properties, the atrophogenic side effect of corticosteroids also can be used advantageously when treating hypertrophic types of lesions, including hypertrophic scars and keloids, lichen simplex chronicus, hypertrophic discoid lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and cutaneous sarcoidosis (ie, lupus pernio).</p><p>Intralesional injections are not advised when the possibility of infection is present, either as the etiology of the lesion or as a secondary sequela. Intralesional corticosteroids do have some degree of systemic absorption and, although it is rare to have systemic effects, large amounts of corticosteroids, frequent injections, and even small amounts of corticosteroids in diabetic patients produce unwanted systemic effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most intralesional therapy is administered via needle, although a few clinicians prefer jet injection devices. Typically 30- or 27-gauge needles are used, although 25-gauge needles may be preferable when injecting lesions with dense or thickened tissue, such as scars. The needles are placed on 1 or 3 mL Luer lock syringes to prevent the needle separating from the syringe under the pressure of injection. One milliliter syringes are most frequently used because the quantity of medication delivered is usually in the tenths or even hundredths of a milliliter, and the smaller syringe allows for greater quantitative accuracy.</p><p>A larger bore needle (21 or 22 gauge) is used to draw up the solution and subsequently to dilute the corticosteroid with saline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, but then it is removed and replaced with the small injecting needle. Thirty-gauge needles are the most desirable and widely used by dermatologists because they produce less discomfort when penetrating the skin, and prevent rapid injection, which is associated with increased pain. Smaller-gauge needles also allow greater precision in injecting the desired quantity of drug.</p><p>Corticosteroids cause a burning sensation for up to three to five minutes after injection; the higher the concentration of corticosteroid, the greater the discomfort of injection. Thus, most corticosteroids are diluted prior to injection to minimize patient discomfort. Saline is an excellent diluent for all corticosteroids, but some clinicians prefer to dilute with the local anesthetic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. A study comparing saline and unbuffered lidocaine as diluents, however, found no significant difference in discomfort between the two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is possible that the anesthetic effect of lidocaine was offset by its acidity, which in itself causes burning upon injection; lidocaine buffered with bicarbonate does diminish the pain of injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The combination of buffered lidocaine and warming the solution prior to injection may have the greatest impact on reducing injection pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The application of a lidocaine-impregnated tape prior to corticosteroid injection significantly reduces the pain of injection, but is infrequently used in North America because the time to therapeutic effectiveness may be up to 120 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One study demonstrated modest pain relief by cooling tissues prior to injection with cold air and thus avoiding preparing and warming injectable solutions or waiting for topical agents to become effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other standard equipment for injection includes nonsterile gloves, an alcohol swab, 4x4 gauze, and protective eye wear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MIXING THE SOLUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamcinolone</a> acetonide is available in 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> multidose vials. When using corticosteroids from multidose vials, it is advised that dilution of the corticosteroid be done in the syringe immediately prior to injection. The final concentration should be just sufficient to treat the lesion and low enough to avoid local or systemic side effects. </p><p>To dilute a single dose of corticosteroid, it is necessary to gently shake the corticosteroid bottle to resuspend the particles. Sterile saline for injection or 0.5% or 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> may be used as the diluent, especially when using high corticosteroid concentrations or injecting more than 1 mL into a single site. Do not dilute with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> and other long-acting anesthetics, because they will precipitate the corticosteroid in the syringe.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To obtain a 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> concentration, draw up 0.4 mL of saline for each 0.1 mL of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To obtain a 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> dilution, draw up 0.5 mL of 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> for each 0.5 mL of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide </p><p/><p>Immediately before injecting a lesion, gently shake or roll the syringe to ensure even suspension of the drug in the diluent, and consequently, even delivery into the tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INJECTION TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pathology in inflammatory skin lesions is in the dermis, and it is in this layer of skin that corticosteroids should be deposited. The clinician should first prepare the skin with alcohol, then insert the needle at a 45 degree to 90 degree angle into the lesion to the level of mid-dermis, then slowly inject the drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75695\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75695 \">picture 1</a>). When deposited correctly into the mid-dermis, the skin rises slightly and blanches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69986\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69986 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Enough material is injected to just slightly raise the skin surface; often this is only tenths of a milliliter. For large lesions, the needle should be withdrawn partially and redirected to cover additional areas, or the needle can be removed and reinserted in another site. Caution is needed to avoid injecting into subcutaneous tissue; this is easy to recognize because the injected solution flows easily into subcutaneous fat, while resistance is felt when correctly injecting into dermis. Correct injection technique depends upon knowledge of skin anatomy and particularly an awareness of the different thicknesses of epidermis and dermis in different body sites, at various ages, and in specific diseases.</p><p>When injecting inflamed acne cysts or cysts and sinuses of hidradenitis suppurativa, the tissue immediately surrounding the cyst or sinus but still well within the zone of inflammation is the target area. Protective eye wear is strongly advised, especially when dealing with cystic lesions, to prevent material discharged from the injection or the cyst from splashing into the eyes.</p><p>Keloids and hypertrophic scars are directly injected with corticosteroids; however, thick and longstanding keloids are often so tough that they must be softened by pretreatment for 5 to 20 seconds with liquid nitrogen. Alternatively, an injection can be performed immediately peripheral to the affected tissue, directing the needle toward the keloid. Keloids often need multiple treatments three to four weeks apart until there is adequate flattening of the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73191\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73191 \">picture 3</a>). It is not unusual to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> in strengths of up to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL;</span> however, most dermatologists recommend beginning treatment with triamcinolone, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL,</span> and increasing the concentration as needed to avoid excessive and sometimes permanent atrophy and hypopigmentation.</p><p>Having completed the injection, gauze is held lightly over the site to stop any bleeding. Occasionally an adhesive bandage is placed if bleeding continues.</p><p>Data on intralesional corticosteroid therapy for many of the disorders treated with this modality are limited, and there is quite a bit of variation among the experts regarding matching the concentration and volume of corticosteroid injected to the type of lesion being treated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66500 \">table 1</a>). In general, acute inflammatory lesions (eg, acne cysts) and lesions in thin skinned areas such as the face and central chest necessitate lower corticosteroid concentrations and smaller drug quantities than more chronic conditions (eg, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, keloids) and lesions in thick-skinned areas like the scalp and back [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SIDE EFFECTS, COMPLICATIONS, AND PITFALLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effects of intralesional corticosteroid injections are local. These include atrophy, hypopigmentation, and rarely, sterile abscess formation. Atrophy and pigment changes usually resolve over several weeks but occasionally persist longer and are sometimes permanent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50142 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Micronized crystals of corticosteroid remain in skin for weeks and even months, so some clinicians suggest injecting sterile saline into persistently atrophic sites in an attempt to activate the drug and clear it from the skin more quickly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there are no clinical studies that support this practice.</p><p>Darkly pigmented skin is most susceptible to hypopigmentation and depigmentation; caution should be used when injecting these patients and the patients should be advised of this potential complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A sterile abscess may require drainage, and this is usually accomplished by stabbing the abscess with a number 11 blade. Systemic antibiotics usually are not necessary if the abscess has been drained completely.</p><p>Complications related to intralesional injections typically can be avoided by using the lowest concentration and smallest quantity of drug needed to achieve the desired results. It is preferable to inject corticosteroids in small amounts and low concentrations and have to repeat the injection in three to four weeks than to overestimate the corticosteroid dose and suffer a complication. Patients should be advised that the first treatment may not be completely effective and more than one injection may be necessary.</p><p>In addition to using too much of or too concentrated a corticosteroid, another pitfall is incorrect placement of the corticosteroid into the skin. When deposited in the subcutaneous layer, the atrophic effect may be exaggerated and the therapeutic anti-inflammatory effect minimized. Likewise, injecting too high in the skin, in the upper dermis and epidermis, may cause sloughing of the skin.</p><p>Systemic side effects may occur. Repeated frequent injections producing a high cumulative dose of a corticosteroid (more than 40 mg per month) may result in menstrual irregularities and have the potential for adrenal suppression, although good clinical evidence of this is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intralesional-injection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. More problematic is the diabetic patient in whom glucose concentrations are likely to rise and be less responsive to insulin or other hypoglycemic agents. Diabetes is not an absolute contraindication to intralesional corticosteroid therapy; in fact, judicious use of intralesional injections can result in lower blood glucose levels as compared with repeated applications of potent topical corticosteroid. Regardless, caution should be used and appropriate monitoring performed when treating diabetic patients with corticosteroids of any type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
