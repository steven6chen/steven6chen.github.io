Approximately 85 percent arise in the parotid; the remainder originate in the submandibular, sublingual, and minor salivary glands, which are located throughout the submucosa of the mouth and upper aerodigestive tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of parotid tumors are malignant, compared with 40 to 45 percent of submandibular gland tumors, 70 to 90 percent of sublingual gland tumors, and 50 to 75 percent of minor salivary gland tumors.</p><p>Treatment recommendations are based upon retrospective reviews of clinical experience, and there are almost no data from randomized trials to guide treatment decisions. The published literature predominately focuses on the parotid gland, reflecting the relative frequency of parotid gland tumors compared with tumors at other sites. The treatment of locoregional disease, which includes stages I through IVB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110657%7EONC%2F110617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110657 graphicRef110617 \">table 2A-B</a>), will be discussed here. </p><p>All malignant tumors of the salivary glands should be staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) eighth edition cancer staging manual (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110657\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110657 \">table 2A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110617 \">table 2B</a>). Important changes were made to this edition involving the recognition of extranodal extension (ENE) of tumor in lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This will now be noted in both clinical and pathological staging. ENE will increase the clinical node (N) characterization to N3b when clear evidence of ENE is determined on clinical exam and supported by radiological studies. Clinical ENE of nodes should only be considered positive when nodes exhibit fixation to surrounding structures, cranial nerve involvement (not facial from the primary tumor), or skin involvement. Pathological ENE should be noted and graded as to whether it is present and &gt;2 mm, or present and &le;2 mm.</p><p>Other topics on salivary gland tumors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-tumors-epidemiology-diagnosis-evaluation-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland tumors: Epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant salivary gland tumors: Treatment of recurrent and metastatic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms#H84270800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Salivary gland tumors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment when it can be achieved with negative surgical margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with benign tumors and low-grade malignancies are typically treated with surgery alone; patients with high-grade carcinomas and those with positive margins or other high-risk features are usually treated with surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Patients with unresectable tumors may be treated with RT alone or RT in combination with chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H267154432\" class=\"local\">'Definitive radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Preoperative assessment of salivary gland masses guides the surgical approach. Contemporary imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography [CT], positron emission tomography [PET], <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> ultrasound) aid the evaluation of regional lymph node involvement and the extent of tumor invasion, such as facial nerve and skull base involvement with parotid tumors. </p><p>Biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology can usually discriminate benign tumors from malignant lesions and primary salivary gland tumors from metastases or lymphoma, but they are less specific in determining the exact type of tumor, and there may be difficulty differentiating benign from low-grade malignant tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-tumors-epidemiology-diagnosis-evaluation-and-staging#H6966596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland tumors: Epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and staging&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Parotid gland tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection of parotid tumors depends upon whether the tumor is benign or malignant, its location within the parotid gland, its size and invasiveness, and its relationship to the facial nerve. The facial nerve divides the parotid gland into a superficial and deep lobe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66602 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>Parotidectomy is classified as conservative, superficial, or total, based upon the lobes resected and extent of facial nerve dissected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A conservative, partial, or limited superficial parotidectomy is any procedure that is less extensive than a superficial parotidectomy and does not fully dissect the facial nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A superficial parotidectomy involves resection of the entire superficial lobe and dissection along all branches of the facial nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total parotidectomy involves dissection and preservation of the facial nerve with removal of parotid tissue in the deep as well as superficial lobes.</p><p/><p>These procedures are in contrast to a simple enucleation, or shelling out of tumor, which is rarely indicated for salivary gland tumors.</p><p>Adequate resection of tumor with preservation of the facial nerve is the prime objective in management of salivary gland tumors. Unless the facial nerve is directly involved by malignant tumor, every effort is made to protect and preserve its function. </p><p>Preservation of the facial nerve may result in a pathologically positive margin; however, this typically does not carry the same negative implications as mucosal disease. In fact, whole organ sectioning suggests that the vast majority of parotid dissections will harbor a pathologic positive margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The addition of RT for a malignant tumor with a positive margin is discussed below but is not mandated by a pathological positive margin. Benign tumors rarely require additional surgery or radiation for a positive nerve margin. (See <a href=\"#H267154432\" class=\"local\">'Definitive radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superficial parotidectomy is recommended for most benign tumors confined to the superficial lobe, including pleomorphic adenomas (the most common benign salivary gland tumor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Pleomorphic adenoma'</a> below.)</p><p>However, a conservative parotidectomy has been advocated to remove selected tumors in the inferior portion of the gland, particularly Warthin tumors. For benign tumors lying deep to the plane of the facial nerve, the facial nerve is preserved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For malignant tumors of the parotid gland, the extent of resection depends upon the histologic degree of differentiation, as well as the location and size of the tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64529\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64529 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>High-grade tumors are often treated with a total parotidectomy. Lower grade malignant tumors and high-grade tumors located peripherally within the superficial lobe (particularly the inferior aspect) may be treated with a superficial parotidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/5,6,9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9-15</a>]. For deep malignant tumors, a total parotidectomy is typically performed, depending upon the location of the tumor within the gland, with preservation of the facial nerve unless direct invasion is found at operation.</p><p>For more invasive, T4 tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110657%7EONC%2F110617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110657 graphicRef110617 \">table 2A-B</a>), obtaining wide surgical margins of normal uninvolved tissue may entail resection of skin of the face and neck, contiguous soft tissue and muscle, and mandible or temporal bone. Tumors that extend to bone may require a lateral or subtotal temporal bone resection, or resection of zygoma or mandibulectomy. </p><p>Partial or complete facial nerve paralysis due to tumor is present in as many as 15 to 23 percent of malignant parotid lesions at diagnosis and is associated with a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Total parotidectomy with resection of the involved portion of the facial nerve is typically performed for patients who present with facial nerve dysfunction or with clinical suspicion of tumor infiltration at operation. If possible, reconstruction of the nerve with interposition of a nerve graft or static procedures to mitigate facial drop should be done at the same procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>If the facial nerve is functioning preoperatively, every effort is made to preserve it. Prophylactic resection of the nerve, in the absence of clinical involvement, adds little to surgical margins or tumor control and results in substantial morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.) </p><p>Although the use of an electromyography (EMG)-based intraoperative facial nerve monitor has not been conclusively shown to reduce the risk of postoperative facial nerve paralysis, many surgeons consider it a useful surgical adjunct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk and the nature of complications following parotidectomy depend upon the extent of surgery, pathology of the tumor, location of the tumor within the gland, and the experience of the surgeon. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even when the intent is to preserve the nerve, there remains a risk of facial paralysis, with some reports citing incidence rates ranging as high as 27 to 43 percent for temporary paresis or paralysis and 4 to 22 percent for permanent paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frey syndrome, also known as auriculotemporal syndrome or gustatory sweating, is characterized by sweating and flushing of the facial skin over the parotid bed and neck during mastication. Frey syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibers between the otic ganglion and salivary tissue, which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Frey syndrome is reported by approximately 10 percent of patients, although rigorous testing may detect gustatory sweating in as many as 95 percent of patients after parotidectomy. Frey syndrome may occur from two weeks to two years after surgery due to a latency in the regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers; the area of involved skin may increase over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The incidence of Frey syndrome is reduced by minimizing the parotid wound bed using reconstructive techniques such as thick skin flaps, and also postoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. Intracutaneous injection of botulinum toxin A is an effective, well-tolerated, and long-lasting treatment for symptomatic patients; it may be repeated for recurrent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Some authors recommend the use of a sternocleidomastoid flap to decrease the incidence of symptomatic Frey syndrome; however, the data are inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other uncommon complications include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Numbness in the distribution of the great auricular nerve including the ear, especially the lobule, and the face and neck is a common occurrence.

It is the proximity of these structures that determines the major surgical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The surgical approach may be transcervical, intraoral, or endoscopic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. The choice of approach is based upon fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, imaging findings, clinical experience of the surgeon, as well as potential associated complications, including aesthetic considerations. Malignancy should be treated with an external approach to adequately address the surrounding tissue and nodes.</p><p>Benign tumors are most commonly treated by simple excision of the gland. The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and the lingual nerve should be spared.</p><p>Malignant tumors are removed en bloc with the affected gland. This often necessitates resection of the surrounding skin, muscles, and nerves, although effort is made to preserve the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve, the lingual nerve, and the hypoglossal nerve, unless they are encased with tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management of the neck'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite the increasing use of fine needle aspiration cytology for diagnosis, some patients with a submandibular gland mass undergo initial surgical enucleation of the gland before a diagnosis of malignancy can be established. In this setting, the necessity of reoperation to obtain adequate margins remains uncertain.</p><p>In a single institution review of 87 patients, no statistically significant difference in locoregional disease control or overall survival was found for patients managed with enucleation of the gland alone followed by adjuvant RT compared with patients who underwent enucleation, definitive surgical resection, and adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Based upon these findings, patients without clinical and radiographic evidence of disease after enucleation of a malignant submandibular gland tumor may be adequately treated with adjuvant RT, whereas those with gross residual disease following tumor enucleation should undergo definitive surgical resection prior to adjuvant RT. This does not, however, mean that enucleation should be done for known malignant tumors. (See <a href=\"#H1594974832\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sublingual gland tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sublingual gland tumors are rare but usually malignant. Like salivary gland tumors at other sites, surgery is the mainstay of treatment. </p><p>Resection of the floor of the mouth and involved sublingual gland as well as the ipsilateral submandibular gland is suggested even for small tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Concurrent removal of the submandibular gland along with sublingual gland resection may be necessary since its ducts may be compromised even with a limited resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. For larger tumors, en bloc resection may entail a marginal or segmental mandibulectomy and resection of the lingual nerve. In large resections, reconstruction, often with microvascular free-flaps, is appropriate to improve function with floor of the mouth and mandibular defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mandibular-and-palatal-reconstruction-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mandibular and palatal reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite low rates of nodal involvement, an elective selective neck dissection is commonly performed for sublingual gland tumors, particularly when a free flap is utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. A more comprehensive neck dissection is indicated for the node-positive neck. Generally, elective neck dissection should be considered when the histology is known prior to surgery and is high grade, involves the medial mandible, significant floor of mouth structures or requires a free flap reconstruction. A relative indication for elective neck dissection of levels I-III is in a high grade tumor where adjuvant RT is to be avoided. Adjuvant RT may be added for patients with high-grade tumors, positive margins, perineural invasion, or advanced-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

Minor salivary glands are also found in the lips, superior poles of the tonsils, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and trachea. Minor salivary gland tumors are staged according to the anatomic site in which they arise.</p><p>Surgical resection is the mainstay of management. Postoperative adjuvant therapy is prescribed for the same general indications as a comparably staged squamous cell carcinoma.

At this point in time, there are no data on sentinel node mapping in parotid malignancies.</p><p>The management of the clinically negative neck is more controversial. Occult metastases have been detected in 12 to 45 percent of patients with a clinically negative neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/45,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,48,49</a>]. Based upon this high rate of occult metastases, some experts recommend elective neck dissection for all patients with malignant salivary gland tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>].

Elective dissection of levels II and III can easily be performed with minimal additional morbidity at the time of parotidectomy and should be considered for high-grade salivary gland tumors where adjuvant RT is not planned. If RT is to be used postoperatively, elective neck dissection is less important, given the equivalency of surgery and RT in the treatment of the clinically negative neck.

As an example, a multivariate analysis of outcomes from 2170 patients with malignant major salivary gland tumors identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database found that the addition of RT to surgery significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for mortality 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign salivary gland tumors have a low recurrence rate and an excellent prognosis after adequate surgical resection; thus there is no role for adjuvant therapy following initial resection.

The radiation treatment volume encompasses the original tumor bed and regional lymph nodes only if involved or thought to be at high risk. For adenoid cystic carcinoma, neural pathways to the skull base are also included.</p><p>Retrospective data do not provide evidence that adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is more effective than adjuvant RT alone. An analysis of over 2000 patients from the National Cancer Database failed to demonstrate any improvement in overall survival with the addition of chemotherapy to RT compared with RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Proton beam RT offers the opportunity to deliver very high doses to the targeted tumor while maximally sparing adjacent critical tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, contralateral salivary tissues, and the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Although heavy particle RT with neutrons and carbon ions has been advocated as potentially providing better disease control, the data supporting these approaches are limited, and these techniques are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. </p><p>When conventional RT is used in a good performance status patient due to unresectable disease, consideration may be given to concomitant chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>.

The majority of these tumors occur in the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. Pleomorphic adenoma has historically been characterized as having a propensity for local recurrence and a potential for malignant transformation to the so called &quot;carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-tumors-epidemiology-diagnosis-evaluation-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland tumors: Epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms#H84270800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Salivary gland tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice for pleomorphic adenomas arising in the parotid gland. The recurrence rate after simple enucleation is 20 to 45 percent; with superficial parotidectomy, recurrence rates are reduced to less than five percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. For most pleomorphic adenomas, a more extensive procedure (total parotidectomy) does not reduce the risk of recurrence further and is associated with higher rates of facial nerve dysfunction and other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/68,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,70,71</a>].</p><p>Positive margins, capsule rupture, and tumor spillage have been implicated as potential causes for high recurrence rates, and these should be avoided when possible. However, positive margins are common after resection of this tumor; these occur because of an incomplete tumor capsule, a tendency of the tumor to form perforating pseudopodia, and close proximity of the tumor to the facial nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/4,68,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,68,72</a>].</p><p>Rarely, pleomorphic adenoma has been reported to metastasize to the lung, bone, and elsewhere. Furthermore, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, an aggressive malignancy, may arise in a small percentage of pleomorphic adenomas. Evidence suggests that the occurrence of both is related to incomplete or inadequate primary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms#H84270800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Salivary gland tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent pleomorphic adenomas are treated with resection, but the likelihood of control diminishes with each subsequent surgery while the morbidity increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/74-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-77</a>]. These include facial nerve dysfunction, Frey syndrome, salivary fistula, and necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/70,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,77</a>]. </p><p>The role of postoperative radiation following resection of recurrences is debated, but improved local control with postoperative radiation therapy (RT), particularly for positive margins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multinodular recurrence, has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/70,72,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,72,74</a>]. Although reresection should be performed, if possible, for positive margins, many experts would consider postoperative RT for all patients with recurrent pleomorphic adenoma, depending upon factors such as rapidity of recurrence, patient age, and completeness of resection. Unresectable recurrences are also treated with RT. RT doses used for pleomorphic adenomas are generally lower than for carcinomas, 50 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy fractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumors of major gland salivary glands generally have a better prognosis than those of minor salivary glands, while parotid tumors tend to have a better prognosis than submandibular tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].

Patients should be educated about possible signs and symptoms of tumor recurrence, including hoarseness, pain, dysphagia, bleeding, and enlarged lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttreatment surveillance of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with malignant salivary gland tumors, the intensity of follow-up is generally greatest in the first two to four years since approximately 80 to 90 percent of all recurrences occur within this timeframe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, continued follow-up is generally suggested as there is a risk of recurrence even beyond the first five years. Locoregional recurrence rates were higher in patients with malignant submandibular or minor salivary gland primaries. Distant metastases occurred in 17 percent of parotid primary tumors, but they occurred in 37 percent of those with submandibular primary malignancies. In contrast, 7 percent of local recurrences were observed in patients with benign parotid neoplasms, with a median disease-free interval of seven years and 34 percent occurring more than 10 years after the original diagnosis. </p><p>For patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma, distant metastases are of particular concern and may occur even 20 to 30 years after successful treatment of the primary tumor. Chest imaging is useful to monitor for metastatic disease in these patients. In a single institution series of 467 patients treated over a 46 year period, 31 percent had distant metastases, with 75 percent of these being predominantly lung lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Of those developing distant metastases, 80 percent occurred within the first eight years. Even with known metastatic disease, disease progression can follow an indolent course, with median one-, three-, and five-year survival rates of 75, 47, and 26.5 percent, respectively, often without intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salivary gland tumors include a wide array of benign and malignant histologies that can occur in salivary gland tissue throughout the head and neck.
