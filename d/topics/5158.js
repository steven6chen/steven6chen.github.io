Plasma cell neoplasms can present as a single lesion (solitary plasmacytoma) or as multiple lesions (multiple myeloma). Solitary plasmacytomas most frequently occur in bone (plasmacytoma of bone), but can also be found outside bone in soft tissues (extramedullary plasmacytoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Why some patients develop multiple myeloma and others a single plasmacytoma is not understood, but might be related to differences in cellular adhesion molecules or chemokine receptor expression profiles of the malignant plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas (SEPs, solitary extraosseous plasmacytoma) are plasma cell tumors that arise outside of the bone marrow. They are solitary lesions, and are most often located in the head and neck region, mainly in the upper aerodigestive tract, but may also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, central nervous system, thyroid, breast, testes, parotid gland, lymph nodes, and skin.</p><p>SEP refers to a solitary non-osseus plasma cell neoplasm in the absence of any other sign of multiple myeloma. The diagnosis and management of SEP will be discussed here. Note that extramedullary plasmacytomas can arise in patients with multiple myeloma at any time during the course of the disease, and should not be confused with SEP. The diagnosis and treatment of other plasma cell disorders (eg, solitary plasmacytoma of bone, multiple myeloma, primary AL amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) are discussed separately.

The bone marrow of patients with SEP should have no clonal plasma cells. </p><p>Some patients with a solitary extramedullary lesion may demonstrate up to 10 percent clonal plasma cells, and are considered as having SEP with minimal marrow involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These patients are treated in a similar fashion to SEP, but may have a higher risk of progression to symptomatic myeloma. If patients suspected to have SEP demonstrate 10 percent or more clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, they should be considered to have multiple myeloma rather than SEP. These patients are also often treated in a similar fashion to SEP, but may require additional systemic therapy.

The main condition to consider in the differential diagnosis is multiple myeloma, but other hematologic and non-hematologic neoplasms must also be considered. Solitary plasmacytoma can be distinguished from most neoplasms based on the morphologic appearance of plasma cells and on the clonal nature of the plasma cells, which can be established by immunostaining for kappa and lambda light chains or by flow cytometry. Typically, plasma cells in solitary plasmacytoma will be positive for CD138, CD38, and show light chain restriction (ie, stain positive for either kappa or lambda but not both). Distinction between solitary plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma or other closely related plasma cell tumors (eg Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia) requires additional studies as noted below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple myeloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SEP is composed of plasma cells that are histologically and immunophenotypically identical to those seen in multiple myeloma; however, the treatment of these two entities differs significantly, necessitating a careful review of the diagnosis. A distinction between these two conditions is made based upon the exclusion of additional lesions in patients with SEP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As mentioned above, the diagnosis of SEP requires the exclusion of features of multiple myeloma as evidenced by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal bone marrow with no evidence of clonal plasma cells. Patients with an apparent SEP who have clonal involvement of the marrow &lt;10 percent are considered to have SEP with minimal marrow involvement.

Patients may present with symptoms related to the infiltration of the hematopoietic tissues or the effects of monoclonal IgM in the blood. In comparison, patients with SEP will have no clonal lymphoplasmacytic cells on bone marrow biopsy and only rarely have an unrelated IgM monoclonal gammopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of choice for SEP is radiation therapy (RT) given with curative intent at a dose of 40 to 50 Gy over a four-week period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. If a complete surgical resection was performed as part of the diagnosis, the role of adjuvant RT is less clear. Small lesions may be cured with surgery alone and no adjuvant RT is indicated unless there is suspicion of residual local disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to improve relapse rate or increase disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Bisphosphonates are not recommended for patients with SEP, except in the setting of underlying osteopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma#H488867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of osteoclast inhibitors in patients with multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Benefits of bisphosphonates in myeloma'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with incompletely resected SEP, we recommend the use of local RT rather than further surgery, chemotherapy, or observation. For patients with completely resected SEP after diagnostic biopsy, we suggest observation rather than adjuvant RT or chemotherapy. This approach is based upon the following data from retrospective analyses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective single institution analysis of 18 consecutive patients who received RT (median dose 50 Gy) for SEP of the head and neck reported no recurrences in the radiation field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was a marginal recurrence that was treated successfully with another course of RT. At a median follow-up of 6.8 years, six patients experienced disease progression to multiple myeloma (2 patients) or developed plasmacytoma at another site (4 patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second retrospective single institution analysis of 25 consecutive patients who received RT (median dose 45 Gy) for SEP reported local recurrence in five patients (one marginal and four in-field) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At a median follow-up of 64 months, the five-year probability of progression to myeloma was 30 percent and the five-year overall survival rate was 85 percent.</p><p/><p>The ideal dose of radiation in this setting is unknown. Retrospective analyses have suggested that radiation doses of 40 Gy or greater are associated with improved local control (eg, local failure rates of 9 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26</a>].</p><p>There are limited data regarding the preferred radiation volume for SEP. A retrospective study of patients with SEP of the head and neck suggested an increased risk of recurrence when RT was administered to the gross tumor plus a 2 cm margin when compared with those who received RT to the entire nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For this reason, we prefer larger radiation fields, when toxicity permits. While there is no current evidence that treatment of adjacent lymph nodes results in improved overall response, we typically radiate adjacent nodes in those plasmacytomas with a rich lymphatic drainage with efforts to avoid irradiating any salivary glands in the process. Nodal irradiation is not given to those with a plasmacytoma in the nasal or paranasal areas, or glottis.</p><p>As mentioned above, the role of RT after a complete surgical resection is less clear with some series suggesting improved median survival rates when adjuvant RT is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and others suggesting no difference in outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Given the lack of proven benefit and potential for RT-associated complications, including radiation-induced second malignancies, we reserve adjuvant RT for patients with suspected local residual disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less than 7 percent of patients with SEP will develop a local recurrence after tumoricidal radiation; in one series all local failures were in bulky tumors &ge;5 cm in maximum diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients will ultimately develop multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/9,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29,30</a>]. The progression rate is higher (20 percent) in patients with SEP with minimal marrow involvement. </p><p>Reported five-year overall survival rates for patients with SEP have ranged from 40 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/11,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31-33</a>]. It is unknown if tumor location affects outcome. Initial reports suggest that involvement of the head and neck may portend a better prognosis, but it is unclear whether differences in management can account for these improved outcomes. In a series of 18 patients with SEP of the head and neck treated at the Mayo Clinic, the median overall survival was 12.5 years with five- and 10-year survival rates of 88 and 55 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Six patients developed multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma at a distant site. In addition, an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database that included 1185 patients with extramedullary plasmacytoma reported superior median survival among patients with involvement of the head and neck when compared with patients with other sites of extramedullary plasmacytoma (13 versus 4 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with involvement of the head and neck were less likely to be treated with surgery alone and more likely to have combined modality treatment with surgery and radiation therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the completion of therapy, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. The frequency and extent of these visits depend upon the comfort of both the patient and physician. If the SEP was measurable by an imaging modality prior to therapy, the same modality (eg, MRI) should be repeated three to four months after completing therapy, and periodically thereafter.</p><p>In general, we see patients every three months for the first two years, then every six months for an additional three years, then yearly or every other year after five years. At these visits we perform a history and physical examination, urine and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum calcium. For patients with head and neck involvement, we also perform a fiberoptic endoscopy at each visit. All patients undergo <span class=\"nowrap\">CT/PET</span> or MRI (whichever imaging modality was used for the initial evaluation) every 6 to 12 months for the first five years after therapy. Other follow-up imaging depends upon the original tumor site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3500137833\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
