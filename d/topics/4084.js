They can produce syndromes of hypercortisolism and hyperaldosteronism and rarely produce virilization or feminization. Many are discovered incidentally on abdominal imaging studies (adrenal incidentalomas), while others present with symptoms of hormonal excess.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidentalomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal tumors are most often discovered as an incidental finding, in over 4 percent of high-resolution abdominal imaging studies. Although most incidentalomas are nonfunctional, as many as 15 percent are functional, most commonly secreting slightly increased amounts of cortisol and causing subclinical Cushing's syndrome, also referred to as low levels of autonomous cortisol secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one series of 1004 adrenal incidentalomas, 85 percent were nonfunctional, 9.2 percent were found to secrete low levels of cortisol, 4.2 percent were pheochromocytomas, and 1.6 percent were aldosteronomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Adenomas secreting low levels of cortisol and pheochromocytoma are sufficiently common that <strong>all</strong> patients with an adrenal incidentaloma should be screened for these disorders. In addition, hypertensive patients should be screened for an aldosteronoma, even if the serum potassium concentration is normal. The approach to the adrenal incidentaloma is reviewed in detail separately.

Most adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are sporadic, but some occur as a component of hereditary cancer syndromes.

It had been assumed that the mechanism for this was non-ACTH-dependent autonomous cortisol secretion from the adenoma. However, it is now known that in a proportion of cases, particularly those with modest secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], cortisol can be regulated by the aberrant expression and activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) distinct from the melanocortin 2 (MC2)-ACTH receptor in the adrenocortical tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adrenal-incidentaloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adrenal incidentaloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of aberrant hormone receptors in adrenal adenomas, and more frequently in bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH), is reviewed in detail separately.

The increased occurrence of adrenal tumors in patients with mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) suggested that the <span class=\"nowrap\">Wnt/beta-catenin</span> pathway could be involved in adrenal tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This pathway is essential for embryonic development of the adrenal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and its ectopic constitutive activation is associated with cancer development in a number of tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Activating mutations of exon 3 of the <em>CTNNB1</em> gene (beta-catenin) are frequent in adrenocortical adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. In one series of 39 adrenocortical tumors, an activating somatic mutation of the <em>CTNNB1</em> gene was identified in 7 of 26 adrenocortical adenomas (27 percent) and in 4 of 13 ACCs (31 percent); most were point mutations altering the Ser45 of exon 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a second report, genetic alterations of exon 3 of beta-catenin were found in 5 of 33 adenomas (15 percent) but none in four ACCs or 13 BMAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In a larger study of 100 surgically removed adrenal adenomas (excluding aldosteronomas), 36 percent had <em>CTNNB1</em> mutations, mostly in larger and nonsecreting adenomas, suggesting that the <span class=\"nowrap\">Wnt/beta-catenin</span> pathway activation is associated with the development of less differentiated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Somatic <em>CTNNB1</em> mutations may explain only approximately 50 percent of beta-catenin accumulation observed in adrenocortical tumors, indicating that other components of the Wnt pathway may be involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H283939560\"><span class=\"h3\">Mutations in adrenal Cushing's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic mutations of protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (<em>PRKACA</em>) were identified in 22 of 59 adenomas (37 percent) from patients with overt Cushing's syndrome but not in adenomas secreting less cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This was confirmed in a second report; 35 percent of cases with overt Cushing's syndrome had the same mutation compared with only 11 percent of those with subclinical cortisol secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In additional reports, the same mutation was found in over 50 percent of patients with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/17,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,21</a>]. The most frequent hotspot p.Leu206Arg mutation is located in the active cleft of the catalytic subunit, inactivating the site where the regulatory subunit RII-beta usually binds, thus causing a constitutive PKA activation. Examination of a larger number of samples collected in several European centers identified additional somatic mutations of <em>PRKACA </em>with similar functional consequences;<em> </em>patients<em> </em>with <em>PRKACA</em> mutations had higher levels of cortisol after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> test and smaller adenomas than nonmutated ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]. The infrequent presence of <em>PRKACA</em> mutation in low cortisol-secreting adenomas may explain why they rarely progress to overt Cushing's syndrome with time.</p><p>Somatic activating mutations of the Gs alpha subunit (<em>GNAS</em>) similar to those found in endocrine tumors of patients with McCune-Albright syndrome have been identified in 5 to 17 percent of cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/16,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,21</a>]. Adenomas with <em>PRKACA</em> or <em>GNAS</em> mutations appear to be significantly smaller and secrete more cortisol than adenomas without these mutations, and individuals with these tumors presented at significantly younger ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294294\"><span class=\"h3\">Mutations in aldosterone-producing adenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent causes of primary aldosteronism include bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia (or IHA, 60 to 70 percent) and unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA, 30 to 40 percent).

As noted above, low levels of ACTH-independent cortisol secretion (mild hypercortisolism without clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome) is common in patients with adrenal incidentalomas. However, glucose intolerance and hypertension are common in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and patients may be at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

They are categorized as either functional (hormone-secreting) or silent, and as either benign or malignant.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of adrenocortical tumors are benign, nonfunctioning adenomas that are discovered incidentally on abdominal imaging studies (adrenal incidentalomas). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adrenal-incidentaloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adrenal incidentaloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others are benign, hormone-secreting adenomas that cause Cushing's syndrome, primary aldosteronism or, much less commonly, virilization or feminization. Pheochromocytomas are adrenomedullary, not adrenocortical tumors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Adrenocortical adenomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are rare, frequently aggressive tumors, which may be functional and cause Cushing's syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> virilization, or nonfunctional and present as an abdominal mass or an incidental finding. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adrenocortical carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most adrenal adenomas are less than 4 cm in diameter. In contrast, most ACCs are greater than 4 cm in diameter when discovered. The lipid-rich nature of cortical adenomas is helpful in distinguishing this benign tumor from carcinoma on computed tomography (CT) scanning. (See <a href=\"#H283939662\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At initial presentation, approximately 50 percent of adult patients with ACC have relatively advanced disease stage.
