However, use of these agents has been associated in some patients with the development of anti-drug antibodies, which may promote adverse effects and diminish drug efficacy. Induction of autoimmunity, including both autoantibodies and, much less often, clinically evident autoimmune disease, may also occur during treatment.</p><p>Adverse effects associated with the use of biologic agents that inhibit TNF include injection site and infusion reactions, cytopenias, infections, autoimmune and demyelinating diseases, heart failure, malignancy, and pulmonary, liver, and skin disease. These potentially serious risks are among the factors included in the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> assessment made when deciding whether to use one of these agents in an individual patient.</p><p>TNF inhibitor-related anti-drug antibody formation, autoantibody formation, and the development of autoimmune diseases are reviewed here.

The drug is composed of the human constant region of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) coupled to the variable regions of a mouse anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody.

The immunogenicity profiles of biosimilars also need to be investigated for each of these drugs, as immunogenicity of an anti-TNF biosimilar agent cannot be deduced based solely upon the immunogenicity of the 'parent drug.'

For these reasons, infliximab was approved for use in RA in the United States and Europe together with MTX. However, such restrictions do not apply to the labeling approved for ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, where clinical studies of the effect of MTX cotherapy on drug immunogenicity differ considerably. An immunosuppressive action of MTX on anti-infliximab antibody development is suggested by many, but studies have so far been limited to measure anti-infliximab antibodies in the circulation and not the ability of MTX to interfere with the production of anti-infliximab antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-induction-of-antibodies-autoantibodies-and-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In addition, testing for HACA is not widely available, and most assays measure binding of antibodies to drug, but not whether this binding has a neutralizing effect in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-induction-of-antibodies-autoantibodies-and-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>More than half of patients with RA receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> undergo increases in their regular dose over time or shortening of the interval at which the medication is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-induction-of-antibodies-autoantibodies-and-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

This seems to be the case in some patients after prolonged TNF inhibition. In addition, the need to increase infliximab doses over time sometimes results from underdosing at the start of therapy.
