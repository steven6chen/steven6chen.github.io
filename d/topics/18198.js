This disease stage is used to determine prognosis and guide management. It is also used to facilitate discussions about treatment and prognosis between collaborating providers, as well as between providers and patients.</p><p>The TNM staging system correlates important tumor characteristics with survival data to help estimate and follow outcomes. It is based upon a retrospective analysis of survival in diverse samples of patients representing all stages of disease. It reflects the clinical evaluation methods and treatments that are applied to the particular study population. While an individual patient's clinical course and outcome cannot be predicted with certainty, available survival data can help direct treatment decisions and provide an estimate of the likely prognosis.</p><p>Periodic revisions are necessary because advanced imaging techniques and treatments evolve and impact survival. The eighth edition of the TNM staging system, which is effective as of January 1, 2018, includes anatomic stage groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>) as well as two prognostic stage groups, a clinical and a pathologic prognostic stage group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110851 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F117141\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117141 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Staging has traditionally relied on tumor size, involvement of lymph nodes, and presence of metastatic disease. The eighth edition incorporates biologic markers, which improve prognostic discrimination over anatomic staging alone. Outside of the United States, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) implemented the eighth edition changes as of January 1, 2017.</p><p>The rationale and data supporting the eighth edition of the TNM staging system are discussed here. The initial evaluation, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">REVISIONS IN STAGING FROM THE SEVENTH TO THE EIGHTH EDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual, effective January 1, 2018, outlines a new prognostic staging system that relies not only on the anatomic extent of disease, but also on prognostic biomarkers. A clinical prognostic stage table for use in all patients has been developed, based on history, physical examination, imaging studies if performed, and relevant biopsies. It incorporates T, N, M, and tumor grade; and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) status. For those who undergo surgical resection as their initial treatment (before receipt of any systemic or radiation therapy), a pathologic prognostic table has been developed and assigns stage based on all clinical information, biomarker data, and findings from surgery and resected tissue. (See <a href=\"#H2479181782\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic stage groupings'</a> below.)</p><p>In areas in which biomarker testing is performed, prognostic stage groups should be utilized. Although the prognostic staging system provides refined information regarding outcomes, the anatomic staging was retained to allow a common lexicon for patients treated worldwide who may not have access to biomarker testing. Additionally, the anatomic staging system provides a link to cases treated historically, staged using previous editions of the TNM system.</p><p>The biomarkers utilized in the eighth edition staging system and supporting data are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3825375601\" class=\"local\">'Incorporation of biologic prognostic factors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2348365741\" class=\"local\">'Validation'</a> below.)</p><p>Modest changes were made to the anatomic staging system and are discussed in the relevant sections below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'The eighth edition TNM staging system'</a> below.)</p><p>Outside of the United States, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) has implemented the eighth edition changes as of January 1, 2017.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3825375601\"><span class=\"h2\">Incorporation of biologic prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following were incorporated into the prognostic staging system of the eighth edition of the AJCC staging manual:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression &ndash; </strong>Testing for ER and PR is typically performed using immunohistochemistry. A tumor is considered ER or PR positive if 1 percent or greater of tumor cells stain for the respective protein, regardless of the strength of staining. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormone receptors in breast cancer: Clinical utility and guideline recommendations to improve test accuracy&quot;, section on 'Assays for ER and PR'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) &ndash; </strong>HER2 is assayed using either immunohistochemistry to assess protein levels or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to quantify gene copy number (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64757\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64757 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72767\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72767 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HER2 and predicting response to therapy in breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Testing for HER2 expression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Histologic grade &ndash; </strong>The grade of a tumor is determined by assessing morphologic features (ie, formation of tubules, mitotic count, and variability and the size and shape of cellular nuclei), assigning a score between 1 (most favorable) and 3 (least favorable) for each feature, and totaling the scores. Grade 1 corresponds to combined scores between 3 and 5, grade 2 corresponds to a combined score of 6 or 7, and grade 3 corresponds to a combined score of 8 or 9.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurrence Score (RS)</strong> &ndash; The results of a multigene assay should be incorporated into the prognostic staging for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative tumors that are &lt;5 cm. Specifically, for such patients, an RS &lt;11 on Oncotype Dx denotes a prognosis similar to those with T1a to b N0M0 tumors, and they are assigned a prognostic stage of IA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Oncotype Dx is a genomic assay of 21 genes assessed by reverse transcription&nbsp;polymerase chain reaction&nbsp;(RT-PCR). A score &lt;11 denotes a favorable prognosis, with the TAILORx trial demonstrating a five-year distant recurrence-free survival of 99.3 percent for such patients with endocrine therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Standard cutoffs for high, intermediate, or low Ki-67 scores do not exist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multigene expression assays other than RS</strong> &ndash; RS was the only multigene expression panel supported by level I evidence, and therefore was included in the eighth edition of the TNM staging system. Other multigene expression panels, however, including Mammaprint, EndoPredict, PAM50 Risk of Recurrence (ROR), and the Breast Cancer Index are supported by level II evidence and may be incorporated into future editions of the TNM staging system when high-level data are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H103670818\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Gene expression profiles'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk assessment models &ndash;</strong> The AJCC evaluated 30 prognostication tools for breast cancer and found that two tools, Adjuvant! Online and PREDICT-Plus, met all of the predefined inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. These tools provide estimates of outcomes among women treated for early breast cancer and indicate the relative benefit of adjuvant treatments. They were externally validated and have acceptable levels of predictive accuracy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer#H3290925\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Benefit-risk calculators'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) &ndash; </strong>CTCs are cancer cells that separate from solid tumors and enter the blood stream. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the CellSearch assay for detection of CTCs in metastatic breast cancer, in which they are a poor prognostic indicator. This assay uses ferrofluid nanoparticles with antibodies that target epithelial cell adhesion molecules, allowing for magnetic separation and subsequent immunohistochemical staining of cancer cells. For metastatic breast cancer, the cutoff for an unfavorable prognosis is &ge;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/7</span>.5 mL. Although the use of this assay in primary breast cancer has been explored, an expert panel from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) concluded that there are insufficient data to support its use in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-metastatic-breast-cancer#H2704924032\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in metastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Circulating tumor cells'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H682640131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Disseminated and circulating tumor cells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) &ndash; </strong>Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow provide prognostic information regarding the likelihood of relapse at the time of initial tumor resection. The relevant cutoff is &ge;1 cell. Although DTCs may provide prognostic information and are included as an additional factor for clinical care in the eighth edition AJCC manual, an ASCO expert panel on tumor markers in breast cancer concluded that the available data were insufficient to recommend their use in clinical decision-making. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H682640131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Disseminated and circulating tumor cells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348365741\"><span class=\"h2\">Validation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two independent groups demonstrated that incorporation of biologic markers would improve prognostic discrimination over anatomic staging alone.</p><p>Clinical prognostic stage groups for the eighth edition were established based on a study of 334,243 patients enrolled in the National Cancer Database between 2010 and 2012, representing over 70 percent of breast cancers diagnosed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A second analysis using 305,519 patients who received surgical resection as initial treatment was also conducted and forms the basis of the pathologic prognostic stage groupings. In these analyses, survival calculations were performed based on anatomic stage, grade, HER2, and <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/PR</span> status. Patients with any-grade, triple-negative tumor and those with grade 3, HER2-negative tumors that were negative for either ER or PR had decreased survival, comparable to patients with at least one stage higher disease based on anatomic staging alone. Incorporation of grade, HER2, and hormone receptor status for both clinical and pathologic prognostic staging groups led to reassignment of stage in more than 35 percent of cases compared with the AJCC seventh edition staging system. </p><p>Similarly, in a study of approximately 3700 patients enrolled in a database from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, ER and PR status and grade were found to refine anatomic staging most precisely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When compared with anatomic stage alone, incorporation of these biomarkers (as part of a &quot;risk profile&quot;) resulted in improved discrimination between stages in regards to disease-specific survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110850 \">table 4</a>). Given that this analysis predated the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, a subsequent analysis of roughly 3300 patients found that a staging system that incorporated HER2 status further improved upon the prognostic reliability of the staging system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THE EIGHTH EDITION TNM STAGING SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic and prognostic stage groups, which incorporate biomarkers, are shown in the respective tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110851 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F117141\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117141 \">table 3</a>), with relevant classifications according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2151087017\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical versus pathologic staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each characteristic of a tumor (size, nodal involvement, metastases) can be evaluated and reported either clinically, using physical exam, with or without imaging; or pathologically, using a biopsy.

However, there are instances in which the clinical staging is useful for making initial treatment recommendations, particularly in regards to neoadjuvant therapy and determining eligibility for clinical trials. Subsequent pathology may alter the clinical TNM classification.

The eighth edition of the TNM staging system, effective as of January 1, 2018, is the most recent version and includes anatomic stage groups as well as clinical and pathologic prognostic stage groups, which incorporate biomarker testing. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic stage groupings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2479181782\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic stage groupings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TNM anatomic staging system for breast cancer classifies tumors on the basis of the primary tumor type (invasive or in situ) and size (T), the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M). The overall anatomic stage of the tumor (stage I through IV) depends upon the particular combination of T, N, and M characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'The eighth edition TNM staging system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TNM prognostic staging system for breast cancer relies on the anatomic extent of disease as well as grade, hormone and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor status, and, for those with T1 to 2 N0M0, hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative, node-negative tumors, the result of genomic testing. If testing for these biomarkers is available, patients should be staged using the prognostic staging systems. The clinical prognostic staging system applies to all patients. For those in whom surgery is the initial cancer treatment, a pathologic prognostic stage should be assigned. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Revisions in staging from the seventh to the eighth editions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Used with the permission of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), Chicago, Illinois.
