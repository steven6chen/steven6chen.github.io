Having diabetes puts you at risk of other health problems, including heart attacks, strokes, vision loss, nerve damage, and kidney disease. While all of that may sound overwhelming, there is some good news; many of the steps you need to take to prevent one of those complications may actually help to prevent them all.</p><p>This article will discuss the early signs of diabetic kidney disease. People who develop diabetic kidney disease usually have no symptoms early on, although the condition puts them at risk of developing more serious kidney disease. More detailed information is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The kidneys play an important role in the body: they filter the blood, removing waste products and excess salt and water. If the kidneys become diseased, they falter in their task, leaving the blood polluted.</p><p>Finding out that you have early diabetic kidney disease can alert you that your kidneys are in danger. It is important to take steps to protect your kidneys before the problem advances. Information about advanced kidney disease is also available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, diabetic kidney disease can eventually cause the kidneys to stop working altogether. If that happens to you, you will need to have a kidney transplant or dialysis, a procedure that filters the blood artificially several times a week. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic kidney disease usually causes no symptoms until at least 75 percent of your kidneys' function is lost, and people who have the condition often produce normal amounts of urine. To detect diabetic kidney disease, health care providers rely on tests that measure protein levels in the urine and blood tests to evaluate the level of kidney function.</p><p>When the kidneys are working normally, they prevent protein from leaking into the urine, so finding protein in the urine is a sign that the kidneys are in trouble. Often people who have diabetic kidney disease also have high blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having a family history of kidney disease or belonging to certain ethnic groups (eg, African American, Mexican, Pima Indian) can increase your risk of diabetic kidney disease. Although you cannot do anything to change your family history, there are several factors that increase your risk of developing diabetic kidney disease that you can change. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having chronically elevated blood sugar levels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being overweight or obese</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a diabetes-related vision problem (diabetic retinopathy) or nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetic neuropathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine tests are recommended once per year in people with type 1 diabetes, beginning about five years after diagnosis, and in people with type 2 diabetes, starting at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>The urine test is looking for a protein called albumin. If there is a very large amount of albumin (protein) in your urine, it means you have diabetic kidney disease. You may be told that you have &quot;microalbuminuria&quot; or &quot;moderately increased albuminuria&quot;. That simply means that you have trace amounts of protein in your urine, but it still means that you are at risk for getting diabetic kidney disease, assuming you do not have kidney disease caused by another condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-in-the-urine-proteinuria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The same urine test that is used to diagnose diabetic kidney disease will also be used to monitor your condition over time. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitor for signs of change'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key complication of diabetic kidney disease is more advanced kidney disease, called chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic kidney disease can, in turn, progress even further, eventually leading to total kidney failure and the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with diabetes often focus on keeping their blood sugar levels in the right ranges. And while it is important to control blood sugar, it turns out that controlling blood pressure is at least as important. That's because high blood sugar and high blood pressure work in concert to damage the blood vessels and organ systems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For these reasons, the most important things you can do to stall kidney disease and protect against other diabetes complications are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make healthy lifestyle choices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Manage blood sugar levels'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your blood pressure below <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90,</span> if possible (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Manage high blood pressure'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changing your lifestyle can have a big impact on the health of your kidneys. The following measures are recommended for everyone, but are especially important if you have diabetic kidney disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the amount of salt you eat (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you smoke, quit smoking (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight if you are overweight (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Manage blood sugar levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keeping blood sugars close to normal can help prevent the long-term complications of diabetes mellitus. For most people, a target for fasting blood glucose and for blood glucose levels before each meal is 80 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> however, these targets may need to be individualized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A blood test called A1C is also used to monitor blood sugar levels; the result provides an average of blood sugar levels over the last one to three months. An A1C of 7 percent or less is usually recommended; this corresponds to an average blood glucose of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76310 \">table 1</a>). Even small decreases in the A1C lower the risk of diabetes-related complications to some degree.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Manage high blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with diabetes have hypertension (high blood pressure). Although high blood pressure causes few symptoms, it has two negative effects: it stresses the cardiovascular system and speeds the development of diabetic complications of the kidney and eye. A health care provider can diagnose high blood pressure by measuring blood pressure on a regular basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of high blood pressure varies. If you have mild hypertension, your health care provider may recommend weight loss, exercise, decreasing the amount of salt in the diet, quitting smoking, and decreasing alcohol intake. These measures can sometimes reduce blood pressure to normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-diet-and-weight-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure, diet, and weight (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If these measures are not effective or your blood pressure needs to be lowered quickly, your provider will likely recommend one of several high blood pressure medications. Your provider can discuss the pros and cons of each medication and the goals of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A blood pressure reading below <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> is the recommended goal for most people with diabetic kidney disease, especially if you have more than 300 mg of albumin (protein) in your urine per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood pressure medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with diabetic kidney disease need at least one medication to lower their blood pressure. Several medications can be used for this purpose, but a medication known as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (abbreviated ACE inhibitor) or a related drug known as an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are used most commonly. ACE inhibitors are generally used first because they have been available longer than ARBs.</p><p>ACE inhibitors and ARBs are particularly useful for people with diabetic kidney disease because they decrease the amount of protein in the urine and can prevent or slow the progression of diabetes-related kidney disease. In fact, the kidney benefits of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are so robust that health care providers sometimes prescribe them for people with diabetic kidney disease who have normal blood pressure.</p><p>Still, despite their kidney-protecting abilities, ACE inhibitors and ARBs do have their downsides. For instance, ACE inhibitors cause a persistent dry cough in 5 to 20 percent of the people who take them, particularly among Asian populations. Some people get used to the cough; others find it so disruptive that they cannot continue taking an ACE inhibitor. For them, ARBs are often a good alternative, because ARBs are less likely to cause a cough.</p><p>In rare cases, you can have more serious side effects with ACE inhibitors and ARBs. These include a decrease in kidney function or a condition called hyperkalemia, in which too much potassium accumulates in the blood. To monitor for these and other side effects, health care providers sometimes run blood tests soon after starting these drugs. In some people, the medications will need to be stopped.</p><p>More information on the risks and side effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitor for signs of change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After beginning treatment and lifestyle changes to stall kidney disease, you will need to have repeat urine and blood tests to determine if urine protein levels have improved. If the urine protein levels have not improved or your kidney function has worsened, your health care provider may need to adjust your medications or recommend other strategies to protect your kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have diabetes and are interested in getting pregnant, it is important to talk with your health care provider well in advance, especially if you have diabetic kidney disease. Diabetes and its attendant problems can increase the risk of complications in pregnancy, especially in women with decreased kidney function. However, many women with mild diabetic kidney disease have normal pregnancies and healthy babies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To ensure the best outcome with a pregnancy, the most important thing you can do is to keep your blood sugar and blood pressure under tight control. However, women who are pregnant or attempting to get pregnant should not take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), as these drugs can cause birth defects. Instead, other medications (such as calcium channel blockers) are used during pregnancy to keep the blood pressure in check. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-during-pregnancy-for-women-with-type-1-or-2-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND OTHER DIABETES COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the steps you need to take to protect your kidneys sound overwhelming, keep this in mind; controlling your blood sugar and blood pressure can help to reduce the risk or severity of several other debilitating diabetes complications, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision loss (due to diabetic retinopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve damage (called diabetic neuropathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke and heart attack (both of which can be fatal)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The same measures that are used in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease are also useful in preventing it.
