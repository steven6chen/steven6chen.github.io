There are multiple histologic subtypes of lupus nephritis (LN), and the optimal treatment varies with the subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although the clinical presentation, urinalysis, and estimates of renal function may suggest a specific subtype, renal biopsy is necessary to confirm the correct classification category or class.</p><p>The indications for renal biopsy among patients already diagnosed with SLE will be reviewed here. The various types and classifications of LN, their treatment, and the management of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are discussed separately.

The <span class=\"nowrap\">ISN/RPS</span> classification, which is widely used, is a modification of an older system that was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>The ISN classification divides the glomerular pathology of lupus into six different, main classes or patterns, with subcategorizations based upon activity and chronicity of the lesions by light microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although these subtypes tend to have distinct histologic, clinical, and prognostic characteristics, there is substantial overlap among the classes, based in part upon variations in sampling. In addition, a significant percentage of patients evolve from one form to another, either spontaneously or after therapy. In one older series, for example, the probability of a transition from membranous to combined membranous and proliferative LN was 35 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This observation is not surprising, since the different histologic types of LN represent nonspecific responses to immune complex deposition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and therapy of lupus membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimal mesangial LN (class I)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimal mesangial LN is the earliest and mildest form of glomerular involvement. The glomeruli are normal by light microscopy, but immunofluorescence and electron microscopy reveal mesangial immune deposits. Affected patients typically have a normal urinalysis and serum creatinine concentration. As a result, renal biopsy is generally not performed, and the diagnosis is not often established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesangial proliferative LN (class II)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Light microscopy in class II disease reveals mesangial hypercellularity (of any degree) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mesangial matrix expansion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80250\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80250 \">picture 1</a>). Electron-dense deposits are detected in the mesangium by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The presence of subendothelial deposits on light microscopy (a few isolated subendothelial and subepithelial deposits may be seen on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy) or global or segmental glomerular scars (which are thought to reflect previous endocapillary proliferation, necrosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> crescents) are inconsistent with the diagnosis and indicate either class III or IV disease.</p><p>Patients with class II disease typically present with microscopic hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subnephrotic proteinuria; hypertension is uncommon, and the nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency are virtually never seen unless the patient progresses to more advanced disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal proliferative LN (class III)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In class III disease, fewer than 50 percent of glomeruli have active or inactive endocapillary or extracapillary glomerulonephritis on light microscopy; glomerulonephritis may be segmental or global (ie, less than or more than 50 percent of the tuft, respectively). These lesions are usually associated with focal subendothelial and mesangial deposits on electron microscopy, and mesangial proliferative changes may also be present.</p><p>Hematuria and proteinuria are seen in almost all patients with class III disease, some of whom also have the nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and an elevated serum creatinine concentration. The variable clinical presentation may, in part, reflect an inability to accurately determine the percent of glomeruli involved (and therefore to distinguish between focal and diffuse proliferative disease) due to the potential for sampling error induced by the relatively small number of glomeruli that are typically obtained with percutaneous renal biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse proliferative LN (class IV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In class IV disease, more than 50 percent of glomeruli on light microscopy have active or inactive, segmental or global endocapillary or extracapillary glomerulonephritis, including necrotizing lesions and mesangial involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60218\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60218 \">picture 2</a>). Segmental (IV-S) and global (IV-G) diffuse LN are defined by more than 50 percent of affected glomeruli having segmental and global lesions, respectively. With active disease, proliferative and necrotizing lesions and crescent formation all may be present. At least during the active phase, immunofluorescence microscopy reveals diffuse immunoglobulin and complement deposition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70781 \">picture 3</a>), and electron microscopy reveals subendothelial and mesangial deposits.</p><p>Hematuria and proteinuria are seen in nearly all patients with active class IV disease, and the nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and renal insufficiency are all common. These patients typically have significant hypocomplementemia and elevated anti-DNA levels, especially in patients with active disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lupus membranous nephropathy (class V)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Class V disease is characterized pathologically and clinically by many findings similar to those in idiopathic membranous nephropathy: diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall on light microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56549\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56549 \">picture 4</a>) and subepithelial immune deposits (either global or segmental) on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69348 \">picture 5</a>). However, in lupus membranous nephropathy, mesangial involvement is typically present and includes mesangial proliferation observed by light microscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immune mesangial deposits observed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy.</p><p>Patients with pure lupus membranous nephropathy typically present with signs of the nephrotic syndrome, similar to that in idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Microscopic hematuria and hypertension also may be seen at presentation, and the serum creatinine concentration is usually normal or only slightly elevated in early disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and therapy of lupus membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Concurrent class III or IV proliferative LN can occur in patients with class V lupus membranous nephropathy and are designated as combined disease (eg, classes III and V, or classes IV and V). Patients with concurrent proliferative LN and lupus membranous nephropathy may have a more active sediment than patients with pure class V biopsies and may have an elevated serum creatinine concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced sclerosing LN (class VI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In class VI disease, more than 90 percent of glomeruli are globally sclerosed. The scarring represents healing of prior inflammatory injury, as well as the advanced stage of chronic class III, IV, or V LN.</p><p>Patients with sclerosing glomerulonephritis usually display slowly progressive renal dysfunction in association with proteinuria and, typically, some hematuria. Identification of class VI disease is important since immunosuppressive therapy is not beneficial. Instead, treatment is focused upon nonimmunologic therapies to slow progressive loss of renal function, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or other blockers of the renin-angiotensin system and other medications to treat hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of other renal lesions that can be seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in addition to typical immune complex glomerulonephritis. These include acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (almost always seen with concurrent glomerular disease), vascular disease (eg, thrombotic microangiopathy, antiphospholipid nephropathy, noninflammatory vasculopathy, or vasculitis), drug-induced lupus, lupus podocytopathy, and concurrent renal disease unrelated to lupus (eg, diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These lesions may have important therapeutic and prognostic significance.

This entity is called &quot;silent LN.&quot; These patients are typically not identified in routine clinical practice, since renal biopsy is not performed in patients with no evidence of renal disease. The available data suggest that these patients will either manifest clinical disease or have a benign long-term prognosis with improvement in or resolution of histologic findings on repeat biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Silent lupus nephritis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR RENAL BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless there is a contraindication, a renal biopsy should be performed in almost all lupus patients who have clinical or laboratory evidence of renal involvement (eg, abnormal proteinuria, active urine sediment, elevated serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased glomerular filtration rate) to establish the correct diagnosis and determine the histologic subtype of LN. Patients already on therapy for LN do not require a repeat renal biopsy unless the biopsy findings could alter management (eg, as in someone with worsening clinical parameters despite appropriate treatment). As noted above, the different subtypes have a different prognosis and may be treated differently.</p><p>Renal biopsy is important in patients with lupus and evidence of renal disease because the clinical presentation may not accurately reflect the histologic findings, as illustrated by the following examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with nephrotic syndrome and a bland sediment are likely to have lupus membranous nephropathy but may also have evidence on biopsy of a proliferative glomerulonephritis or a podocytopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an active sediment, no or low-grade proteinuria, a normal serum creatinine, and a normal blood pressure are likely to have minimal mesangial or focal proliferative LN but may have diffuse proliferative disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an elevated serum creatinine, an active urine sediment (red cells, white cells, and cellular casts), and nephrotic-range proteinuria almost certainly have diffuse proliferative LN but may also have marked crescent formation, which might alter selection of <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> response to therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of diffuse or focal proliferative lupus nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In addition to its role in patients with established lupus, renal biopsy may aid the diagnosis in patients for whom the diagnosis of lupus is uncertain, such as patients with nephrotic or non-nephrotic proteinuria without an active urinary sediment and with mild or no evidence of serological activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally perform a renal biopsy in patients who have one or both of the following clinical manifestations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein excretion greater than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An active urinary sediment with persistent hematuria (five or more red blood cells per high-power field, most of which are dysmorphic) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cellular casts.

They may have minimal mesangial or mesangial proliferative disease, neither of which requires immunosuppressive treatment.</p><p>Such patients should be followed for evidence of progressive disease such as increasing proteinuria, emergence of an active sediment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in serum creatinine. These manifestations suggest transformation to a more severe lesion and warrant renal biopsy.</p><p>In patients with an inactive sediment and less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of proteinuria, we suggest performing a urinalysis, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and serum creatinine every three to six months for at least three years; every three months is preferred in patients with anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypocomplementemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of initial biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal biopsy should be performed promptly (ie, within days to weeks) in patients who have an appropriate indication. Prompt diagnosis after the onset of LN and subsequent initiation of appropriate therapy are associated with improved outcomes, regardless of the histologic class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. A rapidly rising serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the development of new nephrotic range proteinuria are indications for urgent renal biopsy so that an accurate diagnosis can be established and appropriate treatment can be initiated as soon as possible.</p><p>The potential magnitude of the increase in risk with delayed renal biopsy was illustrated in a study of 91 patients with LN who were followed for a median of six years. Patients who had clinically recognized renal disease for six or more months prior to biopsy had a much higher rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (47 versus 14 per 1000 patient-years for those who had an earlier biopsy; hazard ratio 9.3, 95% CI 1.8-47.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similar findings were noted in another report in which the relative risk for subsequent renal insufficiency was 4.9 in patients with a delay between the time of detection of renal disease and first renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Some have raised the question of whether renal biopsy might be delayed for one or two months with careful monitoring in patients with mild manifestations of nephritis. However, <strong>none</strong> of the authors or peer reviewers of this topic review delay renal biopsy in such patients since delayed diagnosis has been associated with worse outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of diffuse or focal proliferative lupus nephritis&quot;, section on 'Delayed therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeat biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for a repeat biopsy include the emergence of an active sediment in someone with previously quiescent disease, a new elevation in serum creatinine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> worsening of proteinuria despite treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/4,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16-18</a>]. In a report from a single institution, transformation from one histologic pattern to another was noted in more than one-half of patients who underwent repeat renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The utility of repeat biopsy depends in part upon the histologic diagnosis obtained on the initial biopsy. Among patients with membranous lupus, a repeat biopsy is warranted for those who develop an active sediment since this suggests transformation to a proliferative lesion, which usually requires different treatment. In a retrospective study of 29 patients with membranous lupus, the probability of a transition from membranous to proliferative nephritis at 10 years was 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By contrast, recurrence of proteinuria generally is <strong>not</strong> an indication for repeat biopsy in lupus membranous nephropathy, since relapse of isolated proteinuria is common, especially after immunosuppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Renal biopsy is unlikely to provide any additional data that would affect treatment in most such patients. However, some clinicians would repeat a renal biopsy in this setting to determine the degree of chronicity and establish a new baseline prior to a change in treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of diffuse or focal proliferative lupus nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Settings in which repeat renal biopsy is helpful include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing proteinuria, which, in one report, was the indication for repeat biopsy in 45 of 57 patients with LN who had at least two renal biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As an example, new or worsening nephrotic syndrome in patients with treated proliferative LN may reflect a concurrent membranous lesion, and combined proliferative LN and lupus membranous nephropathy may be best treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil and a calcineurin inhibitor.

Such patients typically present with a gradual increase in protein excretion (non-nephrotic), a bland urine sediment without hematuria (although residual hematuria can occasionally be seen), and a gradual increase in serum creatinine. In a study of 45 patients who had a repeat renal biopsy for the evaluation of increasing proteinuria, the most common finding was a decrease in proliferative lesions and an increase in chronic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In these patients, treatment consists of blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and optimal blood pressure control, not immunosuppressive therapy.
