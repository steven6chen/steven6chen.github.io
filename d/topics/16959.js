The typical presentation of a TTH attack is that of a mild to moderate intensity, bilateral, nonthrobbing headache without other associated features.</p><p>Understanding the pathophysiology and clinical aspects of TTH is important for accurate diagnosis and optimum treatment. However, TTH is a relatively featureless headache, making it the least distinct of all the primary headache phenotypes. In addition, it is the least studied of all the primary headache disorders, despite having a very high socioeconomic impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the classification, pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of TTH in adults. Treatment is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Acute treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Preventive treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tension-type headache in children is also reviewed separately.

The underlying pathophysiology, impact on quality of life, and therapy differ among the subtypes, with peripheral pain mechanisms having more importance in episodic TTH, and central mechanisms having greater importance in chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Acute symptomatic treatments are used for infrequent or low frequency episodic TTH, while prophylactic treatments are used for high frequency episodic TTH and chronic TTH. The category of infrequent episodic TTH identifies individuals who typically do not require medical management, and separates them from those with frequent or chronic TTH; this avoids categorizing most people as having a significant headache disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, a precise diagnosis should be established. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who meet all but one of the criteria for the episodic subtypes of TTH and do not fulfill criteria for migraine without aura are considered to have probable episodic TTH. Patients who meet the criteria for chronic TTH and also meet criteria for medication overuse headache are considered to have probable chronic TTH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Each of the subtypes of TTH is additionally classified as occurring with or without pericranial muscle tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there are no data showing that patients with or without pericranial muscle tenderness differ in terms of TTH pathophysiology or response to treatment.</p><p>The term tension-type headache replaces previous terms such as stress or tension headache, muscle-contraction headache, psychomyogenic headache, and psychogenic headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tension headache was originally named for its suspected etiology (ie, excessive stress or tension leading to muscle contraction). Sustained contracture of pericranial muscles was long believed to be causative in TTH, although the concept is no longer considered valid. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of TTH is probably multifactorial, but the precise mechanisms are uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Environment influences development of episodic TTH more than chronic TTH, while genetic factors appear to play an important role in development of chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Given the wide variation in frequency and intensity in TTH, not only between individuals, but within individuals over time, it is likely that the underlying pain mechanisms in TTH are dynamic and vary from one individual to another, and potentially from one attack to another in the same individual.</p><p>The current pathophysiologic model of TTH posits that peripheral activation or sensitization of myofascial nociceptors are most likely of major importance in episodic TTH, while sensitization of pain pathways in the central nervous system due to prolonged nociceptive stimuli from pericranial myofascial tissues seems to be responsible for the conversion of episodic to chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-12</a>]. Thus, stimuli that are normally innocuous are misinterpreted as pain in chronic TTH. Continuous nociceptive input from peripheral myofascial structures may induce central sensitization. The increased nociceptive stimulation of supraspinal structures results in increased facilitation and decreased inhibition of pain transmission at the level of the spinal dorsal <span class=\"nowrap\">horn/trigeminal</span> nucleus, and in increased pericranial muscle activity. Measurements of pain tolerance thresholds and suprathreshold stimulation have shown presence of generalized hyperalgesia in patients with chronic TTH, while diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) function is reduced in chronic TTH. One voxel-based morphometric brain MRI imaging study showed loss of gray matter structures involved in pain processing in patients with chronic TTH, which correlated with increasing years of headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Pharmacologic studies have shown that tricyclic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors can reverse central sensitization and the chronicity of headache. Finally, low frequency electrical stimulation has been shown to rapidly reverse central sensitization and may be a new modality in treatment of chronic TTH and other chronic pain disorders.

However, in TTH, as in migraine without aura, there may be a lack of habituation when recording sympathetic skin responses compared with normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This electrophysiologic similarity to migraine without aura supports the hypothesis that some patients with TTH might be at the mild end of the migraine spectrum. Since lack of habituation was not always observed in TTH, it seems to be relevant only for a subgroup of patients. Decreased pain, thermal, and electrical thresholds reported in patients with chronic TTH probably represent a central misinterpretation of incoming signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Increased excitability of the central nervous system generated by repetitive and sustained pericranial myofascial input may be responsible for the transformation of episodic TTH into the chronic form.</p><p>Altered brainstem nociceptive reflex findings, including significantly lower subjective pain and reflex thresholds, have suggested that limbic-controlled descending pain systems may be abnormal due to deficient descending inhibition in patients with chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Nitric oxide may play a key role in the pathophysiology of TTH, and novel treatments for TTH that apply the antinociceptive effect of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors are under study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Compared with control subjects without headache, subjects with TTH (unlike those with migraine) have no significant difference in levels of serum N-acetyl-aspartate (a marker of neuronal dysfunction) or serum brain derived neurotropic factor (which interacts with calcitonin gene related peptide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Firm evidence for peripheral abnormalities in TTH is still lacking, but muscular factors may be important, especially in episodic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. Compared with matched control subjects without headache, subjects with episodic TTH demonstrate increased numbers of active and latent trigger points, forward head posture, and lesser neck mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Increased muscle tenderness is the most pronounced and consistent finding in TTH patients and probably represents the activation of peripheral nociceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The intensity and frequency of TTH positively correlates with pericranial muscle tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although the origin of muscle tenderness is unknown, nociceptors around blood vessels in striated muscle, tendon insertions, and fascia have been suggested as sources of the pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>].</p><p>In a small case-control study, levels of the inflammatory mediator interluekin-1 beta were significantly elevated in chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although this finding requires confirmation in additional studies, it lends support to the hypothesis that the pathology of chronic TTH involves sterile neurovascular inflammation.</p><p>As previously noted, sustained contracture of pericranial muscles was long believed to be causative in TTH, but this concept is no longer considered valid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to migraine, hereditary factors seem to play a minor role in the pathogenesis of episodic TTH.

In the population-based Danish twin registry, the one-year-period prevalence of TTH among 12- to 41-year-old subjects was 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of TTH may be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Although the overall prevalence of TTH is high, most patients with TTH have the infrequent episodic subtype, with headaches less than one day a month. Using the International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 (ICHD-2) criteria to classify TTH subtypes, the Danish twin registry found that the one-year-period prevalences of infrequent episodic TTH, frequent episodic TTH, and chronic TTH were 63.5, 21.6, and 0.9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. An earlier population study from the United States found that the one-year prevalences of episodic and chronic TTH were 38.3 and 2.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Women have a slightly higher prevalence of TTH than men, especially with regard to the frequent episodic and chronic subtypes of TTH. In a Danish population study, the lifetime prevalence of episodic TTH in men and women was 69 and 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In another Danish population-based study that evaluated 40-year-old subjects, men were more likely than woman to have no TTH and infrequent episodic TTH, while women were more likely than men to have frequent episodic TTH and chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These differences were all statistically significant.</p><p>Data regarding age dependence of TTH are limited. In a population-based study from the United States, the prevalence of episodic TTH peaked in the fourth decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Other studies have shown that TTH continues to be a problem in older patients, occurring in 20 to 30 percent of those over 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37,38</a>].</p><p>Finally, limited data suggest that whites have a higher prevalence of TTH than blacks of either sex in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Societal impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the high prevalence of TTH, the global burden of disability caused by TTH is greater than that caused by migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39</a>]. This indicates that the overall cost of TTH may also be greater than that of migraine. In one population study, episodic TTH sufferers reported a mean of nine lost work days and five reduced-effectiveness days, while chronic TTH sufferers reported a mean of 27 lost work days and 20 reduced-effectiveness days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The burden is particularly high for the minority who has substantial and complicating co-morbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The impact is greatest on those with TTH who continue to suffer into their geriatric years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37,38</a>].</p><p>While TTH is the most common form of headache, only a small percentage of TTH sufferers seek medical care because of this diagnosis, probably because most individuals with TTH have infrequent, mild headaches. In fact, some experts regard the infrequent episodic subtype of TTH not as a disease, but as a normal phenomenon that does not require medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical presentation of a TTH attack is that of a mild to moderate intensity, bilateral, nonthrobbing headache without other associated features. Descriptions of TTH pain are characteristically nondescript: &quot;dull,&quot; &quot;pressure,&quot; &quot;head fullness&quot;, &quot;head feels large,&quot; or, more descriptively, &quot;like a tight cap&quot;, &quot;band-like,&quot; or a &quot;heavy weight on my head or shoulders.&quot;</p><p>The pain in TTH may infrequently be unilateral or pulsating. In the Danish TTH population, a pulsating quality of pain with TTH was seldom or never present in 80 to 86 percent of the respondents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,41</a>].

Muscle tenderness in the head, neck, or shoulders (ie, pericranial tenderness) is associated with both the intensity and the frequency of TTH attacks and is typically exacerbated during the headache experience. The presence or absence of pericranial muscle tenderness should be elicited from the history and confirmed on examination by manual palpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Manual palpation is performed by applying firm pressure with the second and third finger and making small rotating movements on the pericranial muscles, including the frontal, temporal, masseter, pterygoid, sternocleidomastoid, splenius, and trapezius muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An in-vivo study in tender trapezius muscle in patients with chronic TTH during rest and static exercise provided evidence of normal interstitial levels of inflammatory mediators and metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

However, it may be difficult to distinguish episodic TTH from mild forms of migraine (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic challenges'</a> below).

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pericranial muscle tenderness'</a> above.)</p><p>The ICHD-3 criteria were designed to distinguish between TTH, migraine, and cluster headache. There are no auras with TTH, whether visual, language, sensory, motor, or coordination. Similarly, other features typically associated with migraine headache, such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and noise, are not features of episodic TTH. However, the presence of photophobia or phonophobia (but not both) does not exclude the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is an exception for chronic TTH that allows mild nausea as long as there is no photophobia or phonophobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The proportion of TTH associated with cranial autonomic features is currently unknown, but these are uncommon accompaniments in the author's experience.</p><p>When a patient has headaches that meet all but one of the TTH criteria, the attacks fulfill ICHD-3 criteria for probable TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the practitioner must also consider whether criteria are met for migraine or probable migraine. If so, all other available information should be used to decide whether the attacks are more likely to be probable migraine or probable TTH.</p><p>The distinction between episodic and chronic headache types is complicated by inaccuracies in patient-reported headache frequency when depending upon retrospective patient recall. As an example, a large survey study found that subjects tended to report monthly headache frequency rounded to the nearest five days. Women were more likely to round than men; rounding decreased with increasing age and increased with symptoms of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

This hypothesis was validated by the Landmark study, which evaluated 1203 patients visiting a primary practitioner with a complaint of episodic headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The subjects then recorded their next six headaches in diaries, and each headache was strictly classified according to the original 1988 International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Overall, ICHD-defined migraine was present in 94 percent of the subjects (including 76 percent with migraine and 18 percent with probable migraine), while TTH, by definition episodic, was present in 3 percent.</p><p>Diagnostic challenges occur when patients underreport symptoms by poorly describing them (typically underreporting migraine symptomatology) or when TTH-like headaches are more severe than typical TTH and associated with photophobia or phonophobia. In the Spectrum study, 32 percent of patients with an initial diagnosis of episodic TTH were diagnosed with migraine or probable migraine when headache diaries were reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Those TTH sufferers reclassified as migraineurs responded to triptans in the study, while episodic TTH sufferers not meeting criteria for migraine responded at placebo rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The results provide further support for the notion that patients with disabling episodic headache are more likely to suffer migraine than TTH.</p><p>Distinguishing episodic TTH from migraine without aura may be difficult. As an example, the diagnosis of probable TTH can be made according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) classification in a patient with a unilateral, severe, nonthrobbing headache that is not aggravated by normal physical activity and has no associated symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This same individual also meets ICHD-3 criteria for probable migraine. In such cases, the ICHD-3 recommends that all other available information should be used to decide which of the alternative diagnoses are more likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This information may include patient age, gender, longitudinal headache history (especially regarding how the headache started), family history, the effect of drugs, whether headaches are related to menses, and a range of other features. Fulfillment of all diagnostic criteria for any headache disorder (eg, TTH or any of its subtypes) always trumps fulfillment of criteria for any &quot;probable&quot; diagnostic category (eg, probable migraine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>As noted above, throbbing or pulsating pain may infrequently occur with TTH, presumably when the pain is most intense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thus, another possible presentation of headache that meets criteria for both TTH and migraine is that of a unilateral throbbing headache of mild to moderate intensity without aggravation by normal physical activity and without associated features. Nevertheless, one should be wary of classifying such a headache as TTH rather than probable migraine, since underreporting of migraine symptoms is a common problem. Descriptive reports of a series of headaches that record all details of each episode are warranted before being definitive about a primary TTH diagnosis in clinical practice.</p><p>Other headaches that may cause diagnostic confusion with episodic TTH include cervicogenic headache and sinus headache. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Secondary headaches'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic tension-type headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The challenges for a diagnosis of chronic TTH diagnosis are rather limited and fairly straightforward compared with episodic TTH. Typically, chronic TTH must be differentiated from other primary chronic daily headaches of long duration and, infrequently, from secondary headache disorders. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Secondary headaches'</a> below.)</p><p>The chronic daily headache disorders as a group are not addressed by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3); rather, the classification of chronic daily headache as a form of headache is based upon criteria proposed by Silberstein and Lipton (SL criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

Though only a minority of patients with headaches have a brain tumor, it is crucial to recognize those headache characteristics that may be more commonly associated with tumors. The features of brain tumor headache are generally nonspecific and vary widely with tumor location, size, and rate of growth. The headache is usually bilateral, but can be on the side of the tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-tumor-headache#H20626029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brain tumor headache&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Because pure TTH is uncommon in the office, practitioners must be especially vigilant about the possibility of brain tumor when patients present with a new, subacute, or progressive headache suggestive of TTH.

The development of MOH is typically preceded by an episodic headache disorder, usually migraine or TTH, that has been treated with frequent and excessive amounts of acute symptomatic medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of therapy for MOH headaches is cessation of the offending medications through drug withdrawal and detoxification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MOH represents a significant problem in patients with primary TTH, as such patients suffer stronger withdrawal symptoms on clean-out and have significantly higher relapse rates than patients with MOH who have other primary headache types at both one and four-year prospective follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. This is probably due, at least in part, to the withdrawal patterns peculiar to different agents used for different types of headache, since overuse of mixed analgesics was associated with a significantly higher relapse rate than overuse of triptans (typically used for migraine) at one year after drug withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Sinus headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus headache is commonly diagnosed by clinicians and self-diagnosed by patients, but acute or chronic sinusitis appears to be an uncommon cause of recurrent headaches, and many patients presenting with sinus headache turn out to have migraine or, less often, TTH.

Muscle tenderness in the posterior head and upper neck is a primary diagnostic criterion of cervicogenic headache, and is common in TTH as well.</p><p>While there is no consensus, a practical approach for establishing the diagnosis of cervicogenic headache relies on the use of controlled anesthetic blocks of cervical structures or their nerve supply.
