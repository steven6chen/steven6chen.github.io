Following its initial description in children by George Still in 1896, &quot;Still's disease&quot; became the eponymous term for juvenile inflammatory arthritis, subsequently termed systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In 1971, the term &quot;adult Still's disease&quot; was used to describe a series of adult patients who did not fulfill criteria for classic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but who had features similar to the children with systemic JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of ASD will be reviewed here. It is important to exclude other systemic conditions that may present with symptoms similar to ASD, such as infection and malignancy, before initiating immunosuppressive therapies. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ASD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult Still's disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30061651\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Controlling physical signs and symptoms of inflammation (eg, fever, rash, morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling) and, secondarily, controlling laboratory indices of inflammation (eg, elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and levels of C-reactive protein [CRP]) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult Still's disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventing end organ damage, including joint injury and other major organ complications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult Still's disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizing risk of adverse effects of therapy, including long-term effects of glucocorticoids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30061733\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION AND PREVENTION OF ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The baseline testing, screening, and preventive interventions generally performed prior to initiating certain pharmacotherapeutic agents (eg, vaccinations and screening for latent tuberculosis before the use of biologic agents) are generally the same as those used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); these are described in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-therapies-and-preventive-measures-for-patients-with-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic therapies and preventive measures for patients with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H111270327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>). However, vaccines should not be given until febrile episodes are controlled.</p><p>There is uncertainty regarding which patients with adult Still's disease (ASD), based upon their respective treatment regimens and medication doses, are likely to benefit from the additional use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP). Generally, patients being treated with both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in a dose of at least 20 mg daily for greater than a month and another immunosuppressive medication are among those most likely to benefit from prophylactic treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H3535363337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Regimens'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8180380\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We base our initial therapeutic decisions upon the degree of disease activity, including the extent and severity of organ system involvement. Subsequent treatment decisions depend upon the clinical response to initial therapies. Most patients present with mild to moderate disease, while a significantly smaller number present with severe disease. These groups can be distinguished as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild disease &ndash; Patients with mild disease may present with fevers and rash, as well as with arthralgias or mild arthritis. Some patients with mild disease will respond to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone, but the majority of such patients require at least low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for control of the inflammatory response and the signs and symptoms of disease. (See <a href=\"#H9267157\" class=\"local\">'Mild disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate disease &ndash; Patients with moderate disease may experience high fevers, debilitating joint symptoms, or evidence of internal organ involvement that is not life-threatening or severe. Initial treatment of such patients generally requires glucocorticoids to control the inflammatory response and disease manifestations. Nonbiologic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be needed for long-term management, prevention of joint and other organ injury, and treatment of refractory inflammatory manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H4759609\" class=\"local\">'Moderate disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe disease &ndash; Severe disease is defined by the presence of life-threatening organ involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conditions, such as severe hepatic involvement, cardiac tamponade, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disseminated intravascular coagulation. Such patients require high-dose or pulse glucocorticoid therapy and should receive early intervention with a biologic agent, such as an interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H4761235\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>There have been a lack of randomized trials to compare therapeutic options in this uncommon disorder, and treatment choices remain in evolution, with increasing use of IL-1 inhibitors early in therapy. Support for the use of IL-1 inhibitors as first-line therapy in severe adult Still's disease (ASD) is based upon the more extensive evidence supporting use of these agents in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), given its similarity to ASD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Direct evidence regarding the efficacy of different treatment strategies for ASD is principally derived from observational studies (including case series and individual cases) and from clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. Most of the available evidence regarding the use of IL-1 inhibitors in ASD is in patients resistant to standard therapies, although one open-label randomized trial has suggested that IL-1 inhibitor therapy is extremely effective in ASD and may minimize or avoid entirely the need for glucocorticoids in most patients, except those with incipient or active macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6523097\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for MAS'</a> below.)</p><p>The dosing regimens of nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs that we use in ASD are, in general, the same as those used in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9267157\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest starting treatment in patients with mild disease with an NSAID in antiinflammatory doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 500 mg twice daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg three to four times daily). About 20 percent of patients achieve control of the signs and symptoms of ASD (eg, fevers, rash, arthralgia, or mild arthritis) with such therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/3,6,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,12-14</a>]. Mildly abnormal liver function tests, including aminotransferase elevations, are not uncommon in patients with mild disease and also may respond to treatment with NSAIDs.</p><p>The relative efficacy and adverse effects of different NSAIDs in patients with ASD have not been examined in randomized trials. Salicylates, historically a mainstay of therapy for systemic JIA (Still's disease), are seldom used to treat either Still's disease or ASD because their therapeutic index is narrower than that of most non-salicylate NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin: Mechanism of action, major toxicities, and use in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The adverse effects of NSAIDs are generally the same as in other conditions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>); however, one additional concern with the use of NSAIDs in ASD is the potential for NSAID use to trigger the MAS, the term used for reactive hemophagocytic syndrome in patients with ASD, systemic JIA, and systemic lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. Patients with ASD being treated with NSAIDs require close monitoring for evidence of MAS. (See <a href=\"#H6523097\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for MAS'</a> below.) The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of MAS are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult Still's disease&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H23116141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H8905161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'MAS/Rheumatologic conditions'</a>.)</p><p>We attempt to use reduced NSAID doses (with dose strength and frequency consistent with an antiinflammatory regimen) in patients responsive to NSAIDs alone who remain asymptomatic for at least a month; however, we usually do not discontinue treatment with an antiinflammatory regimen until patients have been treated for a total of at least two to three months. In patients in whom symptoms recur after discontinuing NSAIDs, we resume such therapy; we do not add glucocorticoids unless NSAIDs are insufficient to control signs and symptoms of disease.</p><p>We initiate treatment with glucocorticoids, using the same approach as in patients with moderate disease activity at onset, in patients who do not become symptom-free (eg, no fever or synovitis) within 10 days to two weeks of treatment with NSAIDs alone. (See <a href=\"#H4761211\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4759609\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with moderate disease activity at presentation, such as those with high fevers, debilitating joint symptoms, or evidence of internal organ involvement that is not life-threatening or severe, require glucocorticoids at the onset of therapy. We taper glucocorticoids as tolerated, once control of disease is achieved. We use anakinra as the initial biologic in patients with primarily systemic symptoms and with no signs of joint erosions. If anakinra is inadequate to control disease, is contraindicated, or is not tolerated, other options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, or a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. In patients with predominantly joint disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) is used rather than anakinra to control inflammation, facilitate glucocorticoid tapering, and to prevent joint injury. (See <a href=\"#H4761211\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4760619\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-dependent patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4761211\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with moderate disease, we suggest the use of glucocorticoids to control symptoms. We also use glucocorticoids in patients with persistent disease despite the use of several weeks of NSAIDs to control signs and symptoms of disease. We initiate therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, depending upon the severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pulse intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> is reserved for patients with very severe or life-threatening disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/5,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4761235\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients usually respond to glucocorticoids within hours to a few days, but a longer period of therapy may be required in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. Approximately 70 percent of patients respond to glucocorticoids alone or to glucocorticoids used after a trial of NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19</a>]. In one study of 45 patients with ASD, among whom there were 56 trials of glucocorticoid therapy, those with the chronic articular pattern of disease were less likely to respond to glucocorticoids at disease onset than were ASD patients with systemic disease but without chronic articular involvement (7 of 20 versus 28 of 36 treatment trials [35 versus 78 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most patients in whom NSAIDS alone are inadequate to control symptoms should discontinue NSAIDs when they are switched to glucocorticoids. However, NSAIDs may be continued with caution while administering glucocorticoids in some patients with mild disease, if such co-therapy facilitates use of a lower dose or more rapid taper of glucocorticoids. NSAIDs may provide direct analgesic benefit, in addition to the pain reduction resulting from decreased inflammation with glucocorticoids. Patients receiving concomitant therapy with both NSAIDs and glucocorticoids should receive prophylactic therapy for the prevention of NSAID gastropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who are treated with systemic glucocorticoids, appropriate preventive measures to ensure bone health and to prevent other adverse effects of glucocorticoids should be pursued. The major side effects of systemic glucocorticoid use are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to systemic glucocorticoids, some patients (eg, those with one or two inflamed joints despite use of systemic medications) may benefit from intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. In this case, synovial fluid should be aspirated and should be sent for Gram stain and culture to exclude a joint infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Intraarticular therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Once control of symptoms is achieved for at least a month and laboratory indices have normalized, glucocorticoids are rapidly tapered to a low maintenance dose for two to three months to maintain control of signs and symptoms of disease. As an example, in a patient initially receiving 60 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily, we may decrease the daily dose of glucocorticoid every week with the aim of reducing prednisone dosing to below 10 mg daily within eight weeks, then discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy over the subsequent three months. In patients who are unable to progressively taper glucocorticoids to an acceptable level (eg, less than 10 mg daily of prednisone), treatment with a traditional or biologic DMARD should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4760619\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid-dependent patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic or nonbiologic DMARDs should be used in patients with ASD who are dependent upon glucocorticoids, as, despite their potent antiinflammatory effects, glucocorticoids are not effective for the prevention of progressive joint damage in patients with articular involvement and have undesired long-term side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The DMARD of choice depends upon whether inflammatory joint disease or systemic inflammatory disease is predominant clinically. We generally treat patients who have clinically significant arthritis with MTX or a TNF inhibitor, and we treat patients who have predominantly systemic inflammation with anakinra, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, based largely upon evidence of benefit from these agents in patients with systemic JIA.

The greatest experience is with MTX.</p><p>Most reports of DMARD use in the treatment of ASD involved combination therapy with NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biologic agents. Thus, the attribution of a good clinical response to the specific effects of a particular nonbiologic DMARD is usually difficult. The effectiveness of the biologic agents, compared with the historical observations regarding the more limited benefit of nonbiologic DMARDs other than MTX, have resulted in the use of these other nonbiologic DMARDs only infrequently. (See <a href=\"#H5264003\" class=\"local\">'Disease refractory to usual therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30062847\"><span class=\"h4\">Inflammatory joint disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with arthritis as the predominant manifestation, who are unable to reduce their dose of glucocorticoids to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 10 mg or less daily within two months, or who develop erosive changes on joint radiographs, we suggest the use of weekly MTX therapy using the same approach and dosing as those employed for RA. MTX is given on a weekly basis. The optimal starting dose and schedule for dose escalation are uncertain. We suggest initiating therapy at a dose between 7.5 and 15 mg once weekly for most patients, depending upon the degree of disease activity, upon the size and age of the patient, upon the presence of comorbidities, and upon renal function.

The maximum dose is 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. For patients in whom 20 to 25 mg of MTX orally once weekly is ineffective or poorly tolerated because of gastrointestinal symptoms, a trial of subcutaneous MTX administration is an alternative to switching to or adding another DMARD or a biologic agent.

MTX treatment requires meticulous monitoring for bone marrow, liver, and lung toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a> and <a href=\"#H2862652\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>We prefer to use MTX as the initial DMARD in ASD with significant and predominant joint involvement, rather than another nonbiologic or biologic DMARD, because of its demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of adult RA; the widespread experience with its use; its reported efficacy in ASD, especially for the treatment of joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/22-25,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25,37</a>]; and the potential risk of joint injury in ASD that is similar to that seen in RA.

However, prior to efforts to reduce the dose of MTX or other DMARDs, we try to lower the dose of glucocorticoids, gradually tapering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> as tolerated to 5 mg daily, in patients who have been clinically stable for at least a month on a given dose.

This is especially important during the weeks after starting treatment with NSAIDs, as use can precede the rare development of MAS in some patients. MAS is infrequent, but it can be difficult to distinguish from the underlying ASD and can be catastrophic if not treated. In patients starting these medications, we obtain laboratory studies every two weeks initially and with any escalation of the dose; the frequency of testing can be decreased to monthly if the dose is stable and if the aminotransferases remain within the normal range. The testing can be decreased to every three months after the liver function studies have remained normal for at least two to three months on a stable drug regimen.

In patients with significant residual joint involvement, with a good response of systemic symptoms to anakinra we also add MTX.
