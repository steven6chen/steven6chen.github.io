Selective COX-2 inhibition is associated with reduced prostaglandin I2 (PGI2 or prostacyclin) production by vascular endothelium with little or no inhibition of potentially prothrombotic platelet thromboxane A2 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Coxibs, like nonselective NSAIDs, should be avoided whenever possible in patients at an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and in patients with established CVD, based upon the evidence that these drugs increase the risk of ischemic CVD, heart failure (HF), increased blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia. The absolute risk of ischemic cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction (MI), is low, but risk increases with higher doses, frequency of use, and established CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/4,7,11,12,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,11,12,15,16</a>].

Increased risk compared with placebo has been found in large, long-term randomized trials of celecoxib for indications other than arthritis, including the prevention of adenomatous colonic polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Clinical trials directly comparing celecoxib with other NSAIDs in patients with arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>] and postmarketing population-based case-control studies of nonfatal MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/5,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26,27</a>] and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/6,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,28,29</a>] have supported the view that celecoxib use is associated with a similar degree of risk compared with most nonselective NSAIDs. The following trials and meta-analyses of multiple trial data are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2013 meta-analysis of multiple randomized trials, including comparisons of coxibs with either placebo (data from 88,367 trial participants) or with other nonselective NSAIDs (data from 138,695 trial participants) major vascular events, including non-fatal MI or stroke and vascular death, there was a trend in patients using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> toward a higher risk compared with placebo (rate ratio, RR, 1.36, 95% CI 1.00-1.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This trial, involving 24,081 patients with arthritis, compared the safety of celecoxib (100 to 200 mg twice daily) with naproxen (375 to 500 mg twice daily) and ibuprofen (600 to 800 mg three times daily). Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were present in approximately 90 and 10 percent, respectively. Notably, approximately 75 percent of subjects had no known cardiovascular disease but did have at least one risk factor (eg, hypertension or diabetes). In the intention-to-treat analyses (truncated at 30 months) and on-treatment analyses (truncated at 43 months), the trial found that the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib was not inferior to either of the nonselective NSAIDs. Depending upon the analysis, approximately 2 to 5 percent of subjects experienced a cardiovascular event during follow-up, which was slightly lower than expected. The numbers of patients who stopped the drugs were highly similar across the three groups, as were the proportion who were lost to follow-up. While some limitations of the trial have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], it has important strengths, including the extremely large number of patients, their clinical relevance, and the applicability of the study protocol to typical practice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cardiovascular risk of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> relative to other NSAIDs was also addressed by an indirect comparison of these agents in a 2011 network meta-analysis of large randomized trials involving celecoxib, rofecoxib, lumiracoxib, etoricoxib, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk of MI with each drug compared with placebo appeared lower for celecoxib (relative risk [RR] 1.35, 95% CI, 0.71-2.72) than for rofecoxib (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.26-3.56) and ibuprofen (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.50-5.77). The relative risk of celecoxib appeared greater than that for naproxen (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37-1.67), which had the most favorable cardiovascular risk profile. The data for celecoxib reflect the use of a wide range of doses, from 200 to up to 800 mg daily for many of the individuals studied, but the low numbers of patients treated with low doses and the complexity of the network were given as reasons for not dealing with dose-dependence or the dosing regimen (eg, once- versus twice-daily dosing) in the analysis.

The primary composite endpoint defining overall cardiovascular risk included cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, heart failure (HF), or a thromboembolic event. This endpoint was more frequent in patients receiving the highest dose of celecoxib (400 mg twice daily) (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.1) and was elevated for the lower twice-daily dose (200 mg twice daily) (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.8-3.1), but it was not increased significantly in patients receiving the lower total dose at one time (400 mg once per day) (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-2.0).

The beneficial antiplatelet effects of aspirin for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease result from irreversible acetylation of the active site of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 in platelets.
