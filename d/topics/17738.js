The mainstay of management is still symptomatic: treatment of behavioral disturbances, environmental manipulations to support function, and counseling with respect to safety issues. The future promises disease-specific and, hopefully, disease-modifying treatments.</p><p>The first step in management is an accurate diagnosis of the type of dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, a rudimentary, and nearly always negative, work-up was conducted to rule out a &quot;reversible&quot; cause of dementia, leaving &quot;senile dementia&quot; as a default diagnosis. When no disease-specific treatments were available, that approach had a certain logic, but it is no longer adequate.</p><p>A more precise diagnosis is required for effective management and accurate prognosis. As an example, a practitioner who misdiagnoses &quot;senile dementia&quot; in a patient with progressive memory problems and visual hallucinations, overlooking very mild parkinsonism, might initiate treatment of hallucinations with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>. This apparently sensible symptomatic treatment exposes the patient, who most likely has dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), to severe and even life-threatening deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Addressing the treatment of behavioral and sleep problems is an important aspect of the care of patients with dementia. This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disturbances and sleep disorders in patients with dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of medical problems can be more complex in patients with dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with dementia have a decreased ability to make decisions, to adhere to treatment plans (including medication compliance), and to report adverse effects of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A close discussion with the patient's caregiver is essential in mitigating these factors. Finally, patients with advanced stages of dementia appear to have diminished survival when faced with acute illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Available options for therapy and the outlook for new options, based upon our understanding of the pathophysiology of dementia, are discussed here.

Cholinesterase inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivastigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivastigmine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=galantamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">galantamine</a>) increase cholinergic transmission by inhibiting cholinesterase at the synaptic cleft and provide modest symptomatic benefit in some patients with dementia. The cholinesterase inhibitors are discussed in more detail separately.

The mechanism of action of memantine is distinct from those of the cholinergic agents; it is proposed to be neuroprotective. Glutamate is the principal excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter in cortical and hippocampal neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One of the receptors activated by glutamate is the NMDA receptor, which is involved in learning and memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Excessive NMDA stimulation can be induced by ischemia and lead to excitotoxicity, suggesting that agents that block pathologic stimulation of NMDA receptors may protect against further damage in patients with vascular dementia (VaD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, the physiologic function of the remaining neurons could be restored, resulting in symptomatic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Memantine</a> appears to have modest benefits in patients with moderate to severe AD: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 28-week randomized trial in 252 patients with Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores of 3 to 14 (mean approximately 8) at study entry found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> significantly reduced deterioration on multiple scales of clinical efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Adverse event rates with memantine were similar to placebo, and more patients taking placebo than memantine discontinued the study medication. An open label extension to this study demonstrated benefits for patients previously taking placebo in all efficacy measures relative to their previous rate of decline, and also confirmed the favorable adverse event profile seen in the double blind study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial of 295 patients with moderate to severe AD who were already taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a> compared the efficacy of four treatment strategies: no therapy (donepezil discontinued), donepezil continued alone, donepezil continued with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> added, and memantine therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After one year, patients assigned to receive memantine therapy had a higher score on the standardized MMSE and a lower score on the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (both implying benefit) compared to those not receiving memantine; however the average differences in scores (1.2 and 1.5 points respectively) did not meet the prespecified threshold considered to be clinically important. The trial was stopped early due to slow recruitment. With long-term follow up, memantine had no effect on the rate of nursing home placement over a four-year period after randomization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>There is little, if any, evidence that patients with milder AD benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a>. A systematic review reported the results of pooled data from three unpublished studies of memantine in mild to moderate AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Intention to treat analysis indicated a very small but statistically significant beneficial effect for memantine at six months on cognition (&lt;1 point on the 70-point ADAS-Cog) but no effect on behavior or activities of daily living. Another study analyzed data on 431 patients with mild AD (MMSE 20 to 23) from three trials and found no substantial benefit with memantine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Memantine</a> has shown some evidence of efficacy in patients with VaD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of vascular dementia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The prevalence of AD in older patients (&gt;40 years) with Down syndrome is very high, suggesting that treatments effective in the general population with AD might be of benefit in these patients as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1726646571\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Dementia/Alzheimer disease'</a>.) A randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> in 173 patients &gt;40 years in age with Down syndrome found no benefit to memantine therapy after 52 weeks on treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A low baseline prevalence of dementia (35 percent) at onset of treatment may have contributed to the negative results. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Memantine</a> also appears to have fewer side effects than the cholinergic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Dizziness is the most common side effect associated with memantine. Confusion and hallucinations are reported to occur at a low frequency, but we have noticed that memantine use seems to increase agitation and delusional behaviors in some patients with AD. Others have reported that worsening of delusions and hallucinations is particularly problematic in patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A number of questions about <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> remain to be answered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will long-term treatment benefit those with mild AD?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it truly neuroprotective?

Thus far, after 10 years of availability and use, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> does not appear to have significant side effects. A 2008 systemic review concluded that memantine has been shown to improve cognition and global assessment of dementia, but with small effects that are not of clear clinical significance; improvement in quality of life and other domains are suggested but not proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As a result, treatment decisions should be individualized and include considerations of drug tolerability and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Memantine plus cholinesterase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor in patients with advanced disease. A combination capsule of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a> and memantine in two different strengths is available.

The largest trials demonstrating the efficacy of combination therapy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 24-week trial studied the effects of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> or placebo in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a> in 322 patients with moderate to severe AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. MMSE scores ranged from 5 to 14 (mean approximately 10) at study entry. Treatment with memantine plus donepezil resulted in significantly better outcomes than placebo plus donepezil on measures of cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), global outcome, and behavior. Significantly more patients taking placebo than memantine discontinued the trial, and the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was lower in the memantine-treated group than the placebo group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second 24-week randomized trial compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> to placebo in 433 patients with mild to moderate AD who were on stable doses of a cholinesterase inhibitor (either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivastigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivastigmine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=galantamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">galantamine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Studies regarding the efficacy of this approach are limited by the lack of standardized techniques. A 2012 systematic review concluded that the studies to date provide evidence that cognitive stimulation programs benefit cognition, but that studies were of variable quality and further research is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Individualized therapy sessions focused on training patients and caregivers in the use of aids, coping behaviors, and other strategies to compensate for those functional deficits that were specifically problematic for the patient. Assessments of motor and process skills and activities of daily living were significantly improved compared with controls, both at six weeks and at three months, implying that the treatment has some durability. The intervention also appeared to be cost-effective, specifically reducing costs of informal care giving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>These multidisciplinary, nonpharmacologic approaches to management of dementia have significant advantages in having none of the side effects that significantly complicate drug treatment in this patient population.

Factors that would be important in considering patient referral are: uncertainty about the diagnosis of an early dementia (eg, when difficulty arises distinguishing dementia from normal aging, depression, or encephalopathy); when a non-Alzheimer dementia is likely (early and severe behavioral changes, languages problems, hallucinations or parkinsonism); when there is a young onset (&lt;65-years-old); and when there is a strong family history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factor control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification and treatment of risk factors for stroke, cardiovascular disease, and dementia may represent an important strategy for decreasing the incidence of dementia and for slowing the progression of cognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Patients whose vascular risk factors were treated had a slower decline in MMSE scores compared to those whose vascular risk factors were not treated. Patients with some but not all of their vascular risk factors treated had an intermediate rate of decline.</p><p>Data are not entirely consistent, however, and there are potential harms to overly aggressive risk factor management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As an example, one study in 172 patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) found that MMSE scores declined fastest in patients being treated with antihypertensive drugs who had the lowest tertile of daytime systolic blood pressures (&le;128 mm Hg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Orthostatic hypotension associated with overly aggressive blood pressure management is also of concern, particularly in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), who may have a measurable decline in cognition when standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. We therefore suggest attention to standing blood pressure in patients with dementia who are being treated for hypertension.</p><p>In addition, strong support from randomized controlled clinical trials of vascular risk factor treatment in patients with dementia is lacking. A randomized study of patients with AD found that after two years, progression of white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was less in those who were assigned to aggressive risk factor reduction, but clinical progression was not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dementia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The adjusted median survival for patients with probable AD, possible AD, and vascular dementia (VaD) was 3.1, 3.5, and 3.3 years, respectively.
