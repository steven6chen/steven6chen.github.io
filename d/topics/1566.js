A screening instrument enables detection of <span class=\"nowrap\">conditions/concerns</span> that may not be readily apparent without screening. Screening does not provide a diagnosis; it helps to determine whether additional investigation (eg, a diagnostic evaluation) by clinicians with special expertise in pediatric development is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Effective screening requires that results from standardized screening tests be considered in conjunction with clinical judgment. Desirable characteristics of developmental and behavioral screening tests are discussed separately.

Population-based ASD screening is not universally recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;, section on 'Guidelines for surveillance and screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;, section on 'Early intervention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tiered screening model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-tier screening is used to identify children at risk for ASD from a general population. Second-tier screening is used to discriminate ASD from other developmental disorders in children with developmental concerns. Second-tier screening tools are appropriate for use in children who have failed general developmental screening or an ASD-specific screening test, depending upon the age of the child and level of concern. Second-tier tools are usually more time consuming and may require more expertise to administer and interpret.

General developmental screening tools (ie, broadband screeners) are poor predictors of ASD because they assess different domains of developmental concern than autism-specific screening tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Studies evaluating the utility of broadband screeners find that they lack specificity and may result in over-referral for ASD diagnostic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, two-step strategies incorporating use of an autism-specific screener in those who fail general screening may improve identification of children at risk while reducing false positives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;, section on 'ASD-specific screening tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limitations of current screening tools</strong> &ndash; Although the available ASD-specific screening tools are more accurate than general developmental screening tools for identifying ASD, they have limited sensitivity (ability to identify young children with ASD) and specificity (ability to discriminate ASD from other developmental disorders, such as language disorders and global developmental delay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Due to the variability in the natural course of early social and language development, some children who have initial positive screens (suggesting that they are at risk for ASD) ultimately will not meet diagnostic criteria for ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other children who pass early screens for ASD may present with atypical concerns later in the second year of life and eventually be diagnosed with ASD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To optimize early identification of children at risk for autism, sensitivity is more important than specificity for first-tier screens. Thus, first-tier screening tools for ASD may be positive in children with variable (but eventually normal) social and language development and in children with other developmental disorders (eg, language disorders, global developmental delay). Such children will require follow-up <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> second-tier screening to better characterize their developmental concern(s). However, the potential over-referral of children with positive first-tier screens is preferable to missing children at risk for ASD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Importance of age</strong> &ndash; Screening tools that are appropriate for toddlers may be less sensitive when used for preschoolers or school-age children. The sensitivity and specificity of the ASD screening tools vary depending upon the age of the child and the severity of symptoms. The behavioral skills assessed to identify young children at risk for ASD (imitation, joint attention, and play) are developmentally sensitive. Older children with ASD and those who have received appropriate intervention can and do acquire these skills. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Validation</strong> &ndash; When choosing a screening tool, it is important to know how well the tool performs (eg, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value) in the population in which it will be used. Many of the screening tools for ASD have been validated in high-risk populations (ie, referral clinic, early intervention) but have not been validated in low-risk populations (eg, primary care, general population, community samples) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71355 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Other factors may influence interpretation of scores on various screening tests. Cut-off scores for &quot;failing screening&quot; may differ depending on comorbid developmental concerns such as language or motor delay (eg, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers [M-CHAT] appears to have low specificity in children who were born before 28 weeks' gestation and have associated motor, cognitive, visual, and hearing impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]; the Social Communication Questionnaire [SCQ] may be less valid in young children with limited language) or the child's sex (eg, median scores on the Childhood Autism Spectrum Test [CAST] differ between boys and girls). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Social Communication Questionnaire'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Childhood Autism Spectrum Test'</a> below.)</p><p>Some authors have raised concern regarding the use of a screening measure that relies solely on parent report, suggesting that parents may report skills that health professionals were not able to elicit, leading to falsely negative screens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TOOLS FOR CHILDREN &lt;3 YEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several screening tools have been developed for use in children younger than three years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71355 \">table 1</a>).

Thus, there are fewer studies of screening in older children and less direct experience with the available screening tools in clinical practice. However, the median age of diagnosis of ASD is still later than four years in many communities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Because older children spend a significant portion of their day and their peer interactions in the school setting, tools that incorporate observations or ratings from teachers could add useful information to the screening process. Further research is needed to guide clinicians about the best method of screening for ASD in older children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Social Communication Questionnaire</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), formerly known as the Autism Screening Questionnaire, was developed from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the gold-standard diagnostic interview used in research studies. The SCQ is used primarily as a second-stage screen in research; its use as a primary screen is limited by lack of validation in a large community population sample. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic tools'</a>.)</p><p>The SCQ was developed for use in preschool and school-age children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The SCQ is a parent-report screen that consists of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no</span> questions. There are two forms, one for children younger than six years and one for children age six years and older. The SCQ can usually be completed by the primary caregiver in less than 10 minutes and takes less than five minutes to score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The SCQ can be ordered through Western Psychological Services (www.wpspublish.com).</p><p>The SCQ was validated in a high-risk sample of 200 patients ages 4 to 40 years whose parents had previously completed the ADI-R; 160 patients had ASD according to the ADI-R [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A cut-off score of 15 on the SCQ had a sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 75 percent, respectively, for ASD according to the ADI-R.</p><p>In another study of 151 children (mean age five years) referred for evaluation, a cut-off score of 15 on the SCQ had a sensitivity of 71 percent and a specificity of 79 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The SCQ missed some children with milder phenotypes and higher IQs. Lowering the cut-off score to 11 improves sensitivity but lowers specificity.</p><p>In another study of 808 children aged 18 to 48 months referred to community child health or speech and language services, a cut-off score of 15 on the SCQ had a sensitivity of 64 percent and specificity of 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Different cut-off scores may be needed for verbal and nonverbal individuals since several items related to verbal language are not included in the final score for nonverbal individuals. In the validation study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], the authors concluded that a cut-off score of 15 could be used for verbal and nonverbal subjects without impacting the psychometric properties. However, in a subsequent study with a younger clinic population, researchers found differences between scores in verbal and nonverbal individuals related to missing data (parents leaving a question blank) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Questions remain regarding the optimal cut-off score, whether a shorter version would be more reliable in younger children, and whether scoring needs to be adjusted for items that are omitted (ie, items related to speech in nonverbal children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-screening-tools/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Studies evaluating the predictive value of the SCQ in a general population sample are lacking.
