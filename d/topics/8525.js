The disease course is highly variable, but it is well recognized that there is an increased risk of morbidity and sudden cardiac death (SCD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest and death in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In broad terms, the symptoms related to HCM can be categorized as those related to heart failure, chest pain, or arrhythmias. Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and are at an increased risk for SCD. Overall, age at death has a bimodal distribution with the highest frequencies in infancy and adolescence, and the poorest survival in patients with inborn errors of metabolism and malformation syndromes diagnosed before one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HCM is the most common cause of SCD in young, athletic, seemingly healthy individuals, accounting for more than one-third of SCD cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The terms &quot;idiopathic&quot; and &quot;familial&quot; HCM are sometimes used to describe patients who phenotypically have HCM in whom genetic testing is negative or was not performed, in the absence of evidence for a syndrome or systemic disease (&quot;idiopathic HCM&quot;) or in the presence of a positive family history (&quot;familial HCM&quot;). The assumption is that such patients are genetically-determined with a yet undiscovered mutation or gene.

In addition, secondary causes of LVH such as pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disease, endocrine disease (eg, maternal gestational diabetes), rheumatic disease, immunological disease, and cardiotoxic exposures are <strong>not</strong> considered HCM. (See <a href=\"#H489747930\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>There is debate over whether the phenocopies should be included when describing HCM, however the approach to therapy is often the same.

Based on data from various pediatric cardiomyopathy registries, the annual incidence of HCM from all causes (including sarcomeric, phenocopies, and idiopathic) is approximately 0.3 to 0.5 cases per 100,000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,6,7</a>]. The peak incidence is in infants &lt;1 year old, there is a slight male predominance, and in the US population, prevalence is higher in African American children than in white or Hispanic children. In total, HCM accounts for 25 to 40 percent of all pediatric cardiomyopathy cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. In adult populations, the prevalence of HCM is estimated at approximately 1 in 500 persons.

Because children with sarcomeric HCM often have no or minor symptoms, affected individuals are frequently diagnosed as a result of family screening, detection of a murmur during routine examination, or the identification of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients with syndromic or systemic disease may be brought to attention as part of screening, but only if providers appreciate the association. </p><p>A small subset of patients will progress to an advanced form of the disease that is characterized by relative left ventricle (LV) dilation and wall thinning and systolic dysfunction, the so-called &quot;burned out HCM&quot; phenotype. Such patients are managed according to the standard approach to patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and may progress to the need for mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation.

Many of the classically described physical examination findings in patients with HCM are associated with LVOT obstruction. Persons with minimal or no LVOT obstruction may have normal or nearly normal physical examinations.

The murmur may radiate to the axilla and base, but usually not into the neck. Altering preload and afterload can change the intensity of the murmur, which increases during the Valsalva maneuver or standing abruptly, and decreases with hand grip or squatting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H11876648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Left lower sternal border'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SAM of the mitral valve, or abnormal mitral valve anatomy related to papillary muscle or chordae tendineae abnormalities, can lead to impaired leaflet coaptation and mitral regurgitation. This usually results in a posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation jet, which produces a mid-late systolic murmur at the apex. Centrally directed mitral regurgitation, usually associated with primary mitral valve pathology, classically results in a holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex that radiates to the axilla. However, if the regurgitant jet is eccentrically directed, the murmur can radiate toward the base of the heart and may be confused with the murmur of LVOT obstruction.

The term HCM is applied broadly to a number of different clinical presentations, including sarcomeric HCM as well as HCM &quot;phenocopies&quot; that present similarly to sarcomeric HCM but that have different pathophysiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F107815\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107815 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1508167812\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1517651679\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of HCM in the general pediatric population is likely underestimated since many affected children have subclinical disease, with annual incidence of HCM from all causes (including sarcomeric, phenocopies, and idiopathic) of approximately 0.3 to 0.5 cases per 100,000 children. In adult populations, the prevalence of HCM is estimated at approximately 1 in 500 persons. (See <a href=\"#H4254758145\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings associated with HCM can develop in infants and pre-pubertal children, but are more commonly seen in teenagers and young adults following the growth spurt and other changes associated with puberty. An isolated heart murmur or signs and symptoms of heart failure are most common in infants &lt;1 year of age, while children &ge;1 year of age are most commonly asymptomatic. Presenting symptoms may include chest pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">presyncope/syncope,</span> palpitations, heart failure symptoms, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sudden cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">arrest/death,</span> and the physical examination may be normal or may reveal nonspecific abnormalities such as a systolic murmur, fourth heart sound, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a left ventricular lift. (See <a href=\"#H3082317211\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unless there is a positive family history or a commonly associated systemic disease, HCM is usually not the initial diagnostic consideration for patients with a systolic murmur or heart failure symptoms. However, once a family history of HCM has been identified in this setting, the diagnostic evaluation usually includes a three-generation pedigree, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional testing, which selectively may include ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise testing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy, may be warranted for diagnostic purposes (eg, if the diagnosis of HCM remains uncertain following echocardiography) and for prognostic purposes (eg, assessment of exercise tolerance, risk assessment for ventricular arrhythmias with ambulatory ECG monitoring). (See <a href=\"#H2255389630\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We offer genetic testing to all patients with HCM, unless there is clinical suspicion for a secondary cause of LV hypertrophy (eg, hypertension). In most cases, referral to a clinical geneticist is warranted to guide the evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H1905951551\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HCM is established based on echocardiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The hallmark finding is increased LV wall thickening without an identifiable hemodynamic cause (eg, hypertension, valve disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F110280%7ECARD%2F110302%7ECARD%2F110311%7ECARD%2F110312%7ECARD%2F110318%7ECARD%2F110319\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110280 graphicRef110302 graphicRef110311 graphicRef110312 graphicRef110318 graphicRef110319 \">image 1A-F</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F110321%7ECARD%2F110322\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110321 graphicRef110322 \">image 2A-B</a>). Other findings such as systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve or hyperdynamic LV support the diagnosis but are not obligatory. Identification of a known pathogenic mutation in the setting of otherwise unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is diagnostic for HCM; however, 30 to 40 percent of children with phenotypically-determined HCM will have no identified mutation. (See <a href=\"#H3960121516\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of HCM in children is broad and includes other causes of murmurs, chest pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96739 \">table 2</a>), syncope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60014 \">table 3</a>), and heart failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79989 \">table 4</a>), including primary cardiac and noncardiac etiologies. The clinical course, physical examination findings, ECG, and echocardiogram distinguish HCM from other causes. Other causes of LVH include hypertension; athlete's heart; valvar, subvalvar or supravalvar aortic stenosis; pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disease; endocrine disease (eg, maternal gestational diabetes); rheumatic and immunological disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus); and cardiotoxic exposures (eg, anthracyclines). These other causes of LVH can be distinguished from HCM on the basis of the echocardiogram, clinical history, family history including three-generation pedigree, blood pressure measurements, and metabolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H489747930\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All first-degree relatives of the proband should undergo screening that includes history, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography. Additionally, we proceed with targeted genetic testing in first-degree relatives only if a definite HCM-causing mutation has been identified in the proband. (See <a href=\"#H1152560368\" class=\"local\">'Screening of first-degree relatives'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Colan SD, Lipshultz SE, Lowe AM, et al.
