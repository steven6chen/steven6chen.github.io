In a subsequent report of forty 46,XY infants born with ambiguous genitalia in the Dominican Republic over a 10-year period, five (13 percent) were diagnosed with steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One of the five patients was traced to the original kindred of 38 affected subjects.</p><p>Additional clusters of patients have also been reported in Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and Papua New Guinea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is otherwise thought to be rare. The prevalence in the general population is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, patients with steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency have now been reported from a variety of countries and ethnic backgrounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H886527461\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency are 46,XY with normal testosterone production but impaired virilization during embryogenesis, due to defective conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The nature of the enzyme abnormality in this disorder was discovered when it was demonstrated that 5-alpha-reductase activity in cultured genital skin fibroblasts from affected subjects was reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Cloning of the cDNAs that encode the enzymes revealed that there are two steroid 5-alpha-reductases, termed types 1 and 2, involved in human sex development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid 5-alpha-reductase type 2 is defective in subjects with the disorder, whereas the type 1 enzyme is normal. Reduced DHT formation in androgen target tissues impairs virilization of the male urogenital tract in embryogenesis. The low but measurable serum concentrations of DHT in affected subjects could be due either to residual activity of the mutant enzyme or the normal type 1 isoenzyme. Studies in families in which the type 2 enzyme is believed to be absent suggest that the DHT in the serum of these subjects is predominantly derived from the type 1 enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virilization at the time of expected puberty in untreated subjects may be mediated by the increase in serum testosterone, which induces male-type body composition (muscle growth), or increase in DHT concentrations that occur at puberty through 5-alpha-reductase type 1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androgen and estrogen production are in the normal male range in 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This explains why affected subjects do not develop permanent gynecomastia at the time of puberty. In contrast, gynecomastia at puberty is common in subjects with mutations of the androgen receptor (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disorders of androgen action&quot;</a>). In addition, a steroid 5-alpha-reductase type 3 has been described, which does play a role in congenital disorders of glycosylation, but not in virilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H886527467\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This disorder is due to autosomal recessive loss of function mutations in the gene that encodes steroid 5-alpha-reductase type 2 (<em>SRD5A2</em>). Mutations are distributed throughout the coding region. Over 50 different mutations have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. Point mutations are responsible for most cases. Approximately 40 percent of subjects carry homozygous mutations, in keeping with the finding of frequent consanguinity in the families; the remainder are compound heterozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The disorder has worldwide distribution. Identical mutations have been detected in different ethnic groups. The R227Q mutation, which is associated with retention of approximately 3 percent of normal enzymatic activity, appears to be relatively frequent in Asian populations and may cause micropenis rather than ambiguous genitalia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In some instances, recurrent mutations are the consequence of a founder effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110017744\"><span class=\"h2\">46,XY individuals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical clinical features in 46,XY males with 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency are those reported in the two originally recognized families as well as others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/1,14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The external genitalia often are predominately female at birth; however, the range of undervirilization may be from almost complete male with isolated microphallus and varying degrees of hypospadias to completely female with clitoromegaly or normal female genital appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>]. Although the degree of virilization of the external genitalia is variable, masculinization of nongenital tissues, eg, muscle, at puberty is normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The internal urogenital tract is male, consisting of epididymides, vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts that empty into a blind-ending vagina.

No enlargement (normal female) occurred in four (7.3 percent), a slight degree of enlargement (clitoromegaly) in 27 (49 percent), and a greater degree of enlargement but less than normal male (microphallus) in 18 patients (33 percent). The degree of phallic enlargement at birth can also be judged by observing that 40 of the patients (72 percent) were initially assigned to female gender.</p><p>Concentrations of serum testosterone and estradiol are similar to those in normal men. The level of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) is normal in approximately one-half of subjects and slightly elevated in the rest. Levels of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may be elevated. Because of the defect in 5-alpha-reductase 2, the ratio of serum testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is increased basally in adults and after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, laboratory results may be nondiagnostic; therefore, molecular genetic analysis has been advocated for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>].</p><p>In the initial descriptions, affected subjects were identified when they developed variable virilization at adolescence. Now that many affected families have been reported, it is apparent that the manifestations vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Approximately 55 percent of affected subjects have a blind-ending or pseudovagina in which the Wolffian ducts terminate in the upper vagina. In 40 percent, the Wolffian ducts terminate in the perineum on either side of the urethra. The remainder are considerably virilized, so that they have a predominantly male appearance at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The testes are invariably outside the abdominal cavity either in the inguinal canals, labia majora, or scrotum, and spermatogenesis is often impaired.</p><p>One report of four individuals diagnosed as adults with intact testes found normal lumbar and hip bone mineral density in three individuals and mild lumbar osteopenia in the fourth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study of 16 adult subjects with the disorder, hip bone mineral density was not significantly different than a reference male population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110017677\"><span class=\"h3\">Gender role change at puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, when affected 46,XY children were raised initially as female, gender role behavior changed to male at the time of expected puberty in a variable percentage of patients. In a large extended kindred from the Dominican Republic, 18 of 19 subjects initially raised as females subsequently changed gender role behavior to male at the time of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similar results were described in a report from China; almost all patients from 11 families changed from female to male gender after puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In other reports, however, only 50 to 60 percent of affected individuals assigned female sex in infancy who then virilized in puberty changed their gender role behavior to male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/7,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,28</a>].

Three homozygous 46,XX women (siblings of the Dominican kindred described above) with 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency were identified based upon urinary steroid analyses and genotyping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Biochemical features included elevated urinary testosterone levels and increased testosterone to DHT ratios. They had a normal female phenotype but they had absent arm or leg hair and a decrease in axillary and pubic hair (due to low DHT). They all experienced late menarche (ages 15 to 18 years) but then had normal menstrual function and fertility. These observations suggest that DHT plays an important role in the growth of normal body hair and pathogenesis of hirsutism in women.

Adolescents who are not diagnosed in infancy are typically individuals who were initially assigned to a female gender, but then present at the time of puberty with marked masculinization and phallic growth. Further evaluation then demonstrates a blind vaginal pouch; the absence of a uterus; and bilateral, usually inguinal, testes.</p><p>The diagnosis is supported by the biochemical findings of a normal male serum testosterone concentration, but an increased ratio of serum testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (&gt;20), as well as urinary excretion patterns of 5-alpha- to 5-beta-reduced steroids. Measurement of the urinary analytes is difficult and not widely available; also, measurement of DHT with immunoassays may be unspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Once the decision has been made to maintain a female social role, management practices in many countries include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gonadectomy is done before puberty to prevent or minimize virilization and to prevent development of tumors in inguinal or labial testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Clitoromegaly may be surgically corrected by an experienced surgeon to maintain the glans clitoris. If vaginal development is insufficient, vaginal depth should be enhanced by use of dilators at the appropriate age, and if this is unsuccessful, an artificial vagina should be created surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This practice is still under debate, and any intervention depends upon social and medical standards, which vary by country. The approach may change once clearer practice guidelines become available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estrogen therapy appropriate for inducing and maintaining feminization should be started at the time of usual pubertal maturation or immediately after gonadectomy is performed in an adult, similar to that for treatment of primary or secondary hypogonadism in women. Such therapy is critical to promote breast development and to prevent osteoporosis. Specific studies on hormonal management are lacking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Raised as males or changed gender role to male</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Raising a subject as male requires complex decisions about the time and type of surgical and hormonal therapy. If patients are raised as males, surgical correction of the hypospadias and cryptorchidism (if present) should be performed by a surgeon experienced in these procedures at a time dictated by the degree of hypospadias and size of the phallus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H886529036\"><span class=\"h3\">Supplemental testosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since virilization is usually less than satisfactory, even when some phallic growth occurs after the time of sexual maturation, trials of supplemental androgen are sometimes undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/35,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,46</a>]. Although pharmacologic doses of testosterone esters may raise serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations to the normal range and cause acne and growth of facial and body hair, phallic growth is minimal in adults, and the long-term safety of this treatment is not established.</p><p>The results are different in prepubertal subjects. In one report, as an example, pharmacologic doses of testosterone (two intramuscular doses of testosterone ester 125 mg three weeks apart) led to more than a doubling of penis size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. An alternate approach is to administer DHT itself, either in the form of a transdermal cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] or an injectable ester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Both modes of DHT administration raise serum DHT concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], but neither preparation is commercially available and an optimal regimen or an evidence-based guideline has not been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H886529030\"><span class=\"h3\">Fertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sperm counts have been very low in most patients with 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency in whom sperm production has been measured.

As a consequence, most 46,XY persons were historically raised as females, a practice that is currently changing (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). 46,XX females with 5-alpha reductase deficiency have a normal female phenotype with the exception of late menarche. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'46,XX individuals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is suggested by the characteristic clinical features described above (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). It is further supported by an elevated ratio (&gt;20) of plasma testosterone to DHT in 46,XY individuals after the age of puberty, or in infants and prepubertal subjects after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The urinary excretion ratio of 5-alpha- to 5-beta-reduced steroids has also been used in the diagnosis, but these assays are only available in specialized laboratories. However, definitive diagnosis requires sequencing the DNA of the gene that encodes steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2, termed <em>SRD5A2</em>. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex assignment at birth &ndash; The fact that &ge;50 to 60 percent of 46,XY individuals with this condition who are raised as females undergo change in gender role from female to male after the time of expected puberty complicates sex assignment in infants and small children (see <a href=\"#H886528933\" class=\"local\">'Initial gender assignment'</a> above). Careful psychological assessment should be performed prior to any irreversible interventions, most importantly surgery, to augment male or female development, particularly in children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the complexity of gender assignment decisions in the newborn, we suggest that patients be treated in centers where multidisciplinary expertise in disorders of sex development (DSD) is available.
