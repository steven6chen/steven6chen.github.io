The results have been achieved in the setting of at least 6 to 12 months dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). A low but persistent risk of restenosis and stent thrombosis and increased risk of bleeding with prolonged DAPT remain areas of concern. This topic will present studies of coronary artery stent types including DES with bioresorbable vascular scaffolds. Stent types that have been approved for use are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of intracoronary bare metal stents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comparison of drug-eluting intracoronary stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289441181\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;bioresorbable&quot; (also called biodegradeable) and &quot;bioabsorbable&quot; are used in this topic. Bioresorbable refers to the complete breakdown and removal of a material over time and often by a known mechanism. Bioabsorbable refers to incomplete breakdown; the material may be partially digested and remain indefinitely in local tissue. Stent material and polymer may be bioresorbable or bioabsorbable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103379877\"><span class=\"h1\">BIORESORBABLE POLYMER DES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although bioresorbable polymer drug-eluting stents (DES) have theoretical advantages over durable polymer DES, the evidence from randomized clinical trials presented below suggests that they are comparable to second generation DES (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> or zotarolimus) in terms of efficacy and safety at two years. </p><p>The majority of currently approved DES have a durable polymer, which remains permanently on the stent after the drug is eluted. The polymer itself may result in vascular inflammation or delay endothelialization and healing, therefore contributing to the risk of stent thrombosis. One potential method to decrease the rate of late stent thrombosis with DES is to shorten the length of exposure to the drug-containing polymer. Under these circumstances, the polymer is removed as a potential chronic inflammatory stimulus, and the patient is left in effect with a bare-metal stent with the drug released into the vessel wall.

The difficulty in designing a polymer-free stent is achieving adequate levels of antiproliferative drugs over time to effectively inhibit neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis. In the ISAR-TEST trial, 450 patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions not involving the left main trunk were randomly assigned to a polymer-free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> stent or a conventional polymer-based <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of late lumen loss, angiographic restenosis, or target lesion revascularization due to restenosis.</p><p>There may be a role for a <span class=\"nowrap\">polymer-/carrier-free</span> drug-eluting stent (DES). In these stents, the drug, which is coated to the stent, is released into the vessel wall for about one month. For patients who cannot take dual antiplatelet therapy for periods greater than one month, such as those with a high bleeding risk, these stents may have advantages over bare metal stents. However, such a strategy, that is the use of a <span class=\"nowrap\">polymer-/carrier-free</span> DES in conjunction with one month of DAPT, has not been formally evaluated and we do not recommend such an approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents#H348517385\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of intracoronary bare metal stents&quot;, section on 'BMS compared with DES'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients#H599151795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;, section on 'Bare metal stents'</a>.)</p><p>In the LEADERS FREE trial, 2466 patients who were candidates for a bare metal rather than a drug-eluting stent were randomly assigned to a polymer- and carrier-free drug-coated stent that transfers umirolimus (biolimus A9) into the vessel wall over one month or a similar bare metal stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All patients received dual antiplatelet therapy for one month followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> alone. The primary safety end point, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis (ST), occurred less often in the drug-coated group at 390 days (9.4 versus 12.9 percent; p = 0.005 for superiority), owing to a difference in spontaneous and Type 4C (restenosis-related) myocardial infarction during follow-up. The primary efficacy end point of target lesion revascularization occurred less often in the drug-coated stent group (5.1 versus 9.8 percent; p&lt;0.001).

The higher-than-expected rates of early and late ST in both arms and the lack of a contemporary bare metal stent comparator are limitations of this study. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103379891\"><span class=\"h1\">BIORESORBABLE STENTS OR SCAFFOLDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bioresorbable vascular stents or scaffolds have been approved for use by regulatory agencies in some countries. The Absorb bioresorbable vascular stent (BVS, Abbott Vascular Corporation) and the DESolve 100 Novolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Coronary Scaffold System (Elixir Medical Corporation) have received a CE mark in Europe. </p><p>The Absorb stent was approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2016, but sale was halted worldwide by the manufacturer in September 2017 due to an increase in observed myocardial infarction and scaffold thrombosis. Other bioresorbable scaffolds are under evaluation. In Europe and the United States, regulatory agencies have issued letters to physicians alerting them to an increased risk of major adverse cardiac events for the Absorb BVS based on review of two-year data the Absorb III trial (see below). </p><p>The principle benefit of stenting is to reduce the risk of restenosis after balloon angioplasty; however, restenosis is uncommonly seen 9 to 12 months after the procedure. As a result, the clinical need for stent scaffolding after this period is likely limited. Clinical disadvantages of DES include the potential for permanent side branch occlusion, restriction of noninvasive imaging of coronary arteries with multislice computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the interference with the ability to place a bypass graft at the stented site. In addition, the development of late adverse events after placement of permanent metallic stents has been attributed to persistent inflammation, impaired vasomotion, ongoing tissue growth within the stent frame, and neoatherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Fully biodegradable stents, which are also referred to as bioresorbable stents or bioresorbable scaffolds, are being tested in clinical trials in an attempt to overcome some of the disadvantages of DES. In these devices, the scaffold is in place only long enough to protect against subacute closure, wall recoil, and restenosis. The use of these devices might improve outcomes in patients who need repeat percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery. The disadvantages of these devices are that they are more difficult to implant than metal alloy stents and the struts can fracture with over-deployment from balloon dilatation.</p><p>Early trials using a variety of polymers and scaffolding provided the basis for the current generation of bioresorbable scaffolds under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents/abstract/22-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-28</a>].

ABSORB III included 2008 patients with stable or unstable angina who were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive an everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) or an everolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with acute myocardial infarction and specific complex lesions were excluded. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of the primary outcome of target-lesion failure (cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia&ndash;driven target-lesion revascularization) at one year (7.8 versus 6.1 percent, respectively). Results for the individual components of the primary end point did not differ. Device thrombosis at one year occurred in 1.5 and 0.7 percent (p = 0.13 for superiority) of the two groups, respectively. &#160;</p><p>AIDA trial randomly assigned 1845 patients with stable and unstable coronary artery disease to an everolimus-eluting, bioresorbable vascular scaffold, or an everolimus-eluting metallic stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. After a median follow-up of 707 days, there was no significant difference in the composite primary end point of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization. Specifically, there was no significant difference in the rate of target-vessel revascularization (8.7 versus 7.5 percent, respectively). However, definite or probable device thrombosis occurred more frequently in the scaffold group (two-year cumulative event rates, 3.5 versus 0.9 percent; hazard ratio 3.87, 95% CI 1.78-8.42). Limitations of the study include lack of predilation at a 1:1 balloon-to-artery ratio and lack of routine use of intravascular imaging.</p><p>These studies suggest no advantage for efficacy and a higher rate of stent thrombosis and target vessel failure for the Absorb BVS out to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].
