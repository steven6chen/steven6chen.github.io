The terms are often confusing because they have been variably used to describe clinical syndromes and histopathologic abnormalities that may result from a variety of processes causing injury to the small airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The nomenclature of bronchiolitis has been confusing because clinicians and pathologists have sometimes used one term to describe different disease processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/3,4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7-9</a>]. The following are definitions of the various descriptors used in reference to bronchiolar disorders: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute bronchiolitis</strong> &ndash; Acute bronchiolitis is histologically characterized by intense inflammation of small bronchioles with associated epithelial necrosis and sloughing. Acute bronchiolitis is rare in adults, but has been most commonly associated with infections and inhalational injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchiolitis obliterans</strong> &ndash; The term bronchiolitis obliterans (also called obliterative bronchiolitis) is used by clinicians to describe the clinical syndrome of dyspnea and airflow limitation not reversible with inhaled bronchodilator that is associated with small airways injury due to a spectrum of inhalational agents, infections, systemic diseases, and hematopoietic cell or lung transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70650 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is typically associated with the histopathologic description of constrictive bronchiolitis (see below). However, in the older literature, pathologists used this term to describe intrabronchiolar polypoid protrusions that obliterate the lumen from within, what is now called proliferative bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)</strong> &ndash; Patients who have undergone lung transplantation or hematopoietic cell transplantation can develop bronchiolitis obliterans. BOS is a clinical term that refers to the progressive airflow limitation caused by small airways obstruction that is used when the patient has not had confirmatory lung biopsy. As an example, following lung transplantation, the diagnosis of BOS can be made on the basis of airflow limitation, not by histology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Constrictive bronchiolitis</strong> &ndash; Constrictive bronchiolitis is the histopathologic correlate of the clinical syndrome bronchiolitis obliterans and is characterized by fibroproliferative thickening of the bronchiolar walls causing narrowing of the bronchiolar lumen, which may progress to the complete obliteration of bronchioles. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Proliferative bronchiolitis</strong> &ndash; Proliferative bronchiolitis is a distinct histopathologic pattern in which characteristic intraluminal fibrotic buds, called Masson bodies, extend beyond alveolar ducts to alveoli. When proliferative bronchiolitis is associated with extension of inflammatory cells into the more distal lung parenchyma, the process is called organizing pneumonia. The cryptogenic form of organizing pneumonia, previously called idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H3935023\" class=\"local\">'Proliferative bronchiolitis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory bronchiolitis</strong> &ndash; Respiratory bronchiolitis is seen predominantly in cigarette smokers and is associated with the characteristic finding of tan-pigmented macrophages in the respiratory bronchioles. Respiratory bronchiolitis is typically asymptomatic; when the process advances enough to cause symptoms and radiographic opacities, it is called respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD). (See <a href=\"#H48749398\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory bronchiolitis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cellular bronchiolitis</strong> &ndash; Cellular bronchiolitis is a pathologic term that refers to the presence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate (eg, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils) involving the bronchioles. Follicular bronchiolitis, respiratory bronchiolitis, and diffuse panbronchiolitis are forms of cellular bronchiolitis. Cellular bronchiolitis can also be seen in association with diseases such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48749157\"><span class=\"h1\">BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as obliterative bronchiolitis, refers to the clinical syndrome associated with small airways injury caused by a spectrum of inhalational, infectious, and drug exposures, and also lung or hematopoietic cell transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F101928\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101928 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The clinical syndrome is typically characterized by dyspnea, airflow limitation that is not reversible by inhaled bronchodilator, and a chest radiograph that shows normal or hyperinflated lungs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most instances, the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis remains poorly defined. Injury to the bronchiolar epithelium appears to initiate the process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70237 \">figure 1</a>). The alveoli immediately adjacent to the small airways are also frequently involved. The repair process may result in complete recovery or may be characterized by excessive proliferation of granulation tissue that causes narrowing or obliteration of the airway lumen. In some cases, fibrosis is primarily submucosal and peribronchiolar in distribution, resulting in extrinsic narrowing or obliteration of the bronchiolar lumen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3934638\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A broad range of agents and disease processes can cause lung injury that leads to bronchiolitis obliterans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70650 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/3,10-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-17</a>]. Examples include inhalation of nitrogen oxides, ammonia, welding fumes, or food flavoring fumes (eg, diacetyl); infection with respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, or <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>; and treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, gold, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>. Lung inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases can also lead to bronchiolitis obliterans. Additionally, bronchiolitis obliterans is a manifestation of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients who have undergone lung or hematopoietic cell transplantation. Rarely, bronchiolitis obliterans has also been reported in association with paraneoplastic pemphigus, sometimes presenting prior to the appearance of the underlying neoplasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lung disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Airway obstruction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H464750157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary complications after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Airflow obstruction and bronchiolitis obliterans'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-pemphigus#H337139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic pemphigus&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary disease'</a>.)</p><p>Cryptogenic bronchiolitis obliterans in adults is also described, although less commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a case series, 9 of 29 nontransplant-related cases of bronchiolitis obliterans were cryptogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3934624\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of constrictive bronchiolitis usually include dyspnea and cough, sometimes with sputum production. Symptoms are generally slowly progressive over weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/3,4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,18</a>]. Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, symptoms typically follow the onset of joint symptoms by several years (mean 9.5 &plusmn; 10 years), although they may precede or present concomitantly with the diagnosis in approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>On examination, tachypnea, crackles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheezing may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3934583\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiolitis obliterans should be considered in patients who present with the insidious onset of dyspnea and cough, especially when the symptoms and signs do not follow a typical pattern for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or the patient has a predisposing exposure or condition. As an example, bronchiolitis should be in the differential when airflow limitation is irreversible or associated with a gas transfer abnormality in a nonsmoker. </p><p>A multidisciplinary approach that considers the etiologic and histopathologic classifications and radiographic pattern is often helpful. The clinical setting may also alert the clinician to suspect bronchiolitis; for example, recent toxic fume exposure, symptoms of viral infection, history of organ transplantation, or concomitant connective tissue disease.</p><p>When bronchiolitis is suspected, the most helpful tests are chest imaging, usually a high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, and pulmonary function testing with diffusing capacity and ambulatory oximetry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3934601\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is helpful for excluding other diagnostic possibilities, providing support for the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, and defining the severity of disease. In bronchiolitis obliterans, PFTs may be normal or show obstructive changes with air trapping, but without reversibility following inhaled bronchodilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/4,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,17</a>]. Given the vast number of bronchioles, a large percentage can be narrowed or obstructed before a significant loss of function occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lung volumes may show air trapping (eg, increased residual volume and functional residual capacity). Occasionally, there is a mixed pattern of obstruction and restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or restriction alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], possibly related to the proportion of airways that are fully obstructed. </p><p>The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is usually reduced, particularly as the disease progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Resting hypoxemia is frequently present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3936193\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases of chronic bronchiolitis, the plain chest radiograph is normal or shows only increased bronchial wall thickening or hyperinflation (without marked flattening of the diaphragms or hyperlucent areas that would suggest emphysema).</p><p>HRCT is more likely to identify findings consistent with bronchiolitis than plain chest radiographs, particularly when inspiratory and expiratory HRCT images are obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F101928\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101928 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The most consistent abnormalities on HRCT are expiratory air trapping (mosaic or diffuse) and bronchial wall thickening (eg, nodules and &quot;v&quot; or &quot;y&quot; shaped branching linear opacities). The nodules are centrilobular, consistent with the anatomic location of bronchioles. In addition, ground glass opacity in a mosaic pattern of attenuation is seen in some patients; the mosaic attenuation may be enhanced on expiratory views due to air trapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Except for a mosaic pattern of attenuation, which is highly suggestive of bronchiolitis obliterans, it is often difficult to distinguish severe asthma from bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>].</p><p>Cylindric bronchial dilation or bronchiectasis can be seen with bronchiolitis obliterans, particularly in cases related to transplantation, rheumatic disease, inhalation of toxic fumes, and previous infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Subpleural distribution of patchy consolidation or ground glass density is a characteristic finding of proliferative bronchiolitis on HRCT. Well or poorly-defined nodules on CT scans may correlate with areas of organizing pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3936224\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage in bronchiolitis obliterans are nonspecific. However, bronchoscopy can be helpful in identifying features suggestive of other disease processes in the differential diagnosis, such as the high bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocyte counts in hypersensitivity pneumonitis or endobronchial nonnecrotizing granulomas in airway sarcoid. In patients with bronchiolitis obliterans following lung transplantation, bronchoscopy is useful to exclude other airway abnormalities that can cause airflow limitation on spirometry, such as stenosis at the anastomotic site or endobronchial tumor. In addition, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can help diagnose infection or malignancy as a cause of deteriorating lung function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans#H23527792\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;, section on 'Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage'</a>.)</p><p>Transbronchial lung biopsies generally yield insufficient tissue to make a diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans, as the histopathologic findings are subtle and patchy. However, in lung transplant recipients, transbronchial biopsy may be helpful in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans, although data are conflicting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans#H23527682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;, section on 'Role of transbronchial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3936390\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans usually requires a lung biopsy, although in a high probability clinical setting such as a known predisposing inhalational exposure or hematopoietic cell or lung transplantation, the combination of airflow limitation on spirometry and HRCT showing expiratory air trapping (mosaic or diffuse), bronchial wall thickening, and centrilobular nodules may be sufficient to make the diagnosis.

Transbronchial lung biopsy is often <strong>inadequate</strong> for diagnosis, because these processes involve the respiratory and membranous bronchioles. One exception to this is in the case of bronchiolitis obliterans following lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans#H23527682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;, section on 'Role of transbronchial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713172906\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis obliterans are often subtle, and specific attention must be placed on examining the small airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F101929\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101929 \">table 3</a>). This may include step sectioning of the tissue and using special stains (elastic stains) to identify remnants of the small airway walls. Constrictive bronchiolitis, the histopathologic lesion most commonly seen following inhalation injury, is characterized by alterations in the walls of membranous and respiratory bronchioles, often without extensive changes in alveolar ducts and alveolar walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-adults/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>].

However, severe asthma can be associated with a component of irreversible airflow limitation. A reduction in diffusing capacity is uncommon in asthma, but common in bronchiolitis.

HRCT scans of airway-centered interstitial fibrosis show a combination of peribronchovascular ground glass opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and thickening of bronchial walls.

A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis as only 25 percent of patients were clinically suspected to have aspiration as the underlying cause of their lung disease.

It occurs mainly among the Japanese and is rarely reported outside Southeast Asia. The histologic lesion of DPB is centered on the respiratory bronchiole, and consists of a transmural infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and distinctive lipid-laden &quot;foamy&quot; macrophages. Patients present in their second to fifth decade with sinusitis, productive cough, breathlessness, and wheezing. The clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of diffuse panbronchiolitis are discussed separately.

The main types are bronchiolitis obliterans (also called constrictive bronchiolitis), acute bronchiolitis, proliferative bronchiolitis, follicular bronchiolitis, respiratory bronchiolitis, airway centered interstitial fibrosis, and diffuse panbronchiolitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F101929\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101929 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3934302\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiolitis obliterans may be caused by inhalation injury, infection, or drugs; associated with organ transplantation, rheumatic disease, or paraneoplastic pemphigus; or may be idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70650 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3934638\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiolitis obliterans is typically suspected in a patient with the insidious onset of dyspnea and cough, especially when the symptoms and signs do not follow a typical pattern for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or the patient has a predisposing exposure or condition for bronchiolitis obliterans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F101928\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101928 \">table 1</a>). Pulmonary function testing (PFT) may be normal or show obstructive changes with air trapping, but without reversibility following inhaled bronchodilator. The diffusing capacity may be reduced. The role of bronchoscopy is to exclude diseases with a similar presentation, such as sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. (See <a href=\"#H3936224\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic findings consistent with bronchiolitis (eg, air trapping, mosaic attenuation, centrilobular nodules, and &quot;v&quot; or &quot;y&quot; shaped branching linear opacities) are more likely to be identified on high resolution CT scans (HRCT) than on plain chest radiographs, particularly when inspiratory and expiratory images are obtained; however, HRCT may also be normal. (See <a href=\"#H3936193\" class=\"local\">'Chest imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of cases, open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required to make a definitive diagnosis, although tissue confirmation may not be necessary in patients with a clear predisposition (eg, known inhalational exposure or prior lung or hematopoietic cell transplantation) and typical HRCT. (See <a href=\"#H3936390\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, bronchocentric granulomatosis, diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, and hypereosinophilic obliterative bronchiolitis. (See <a href=\"#H3936181\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential culprit exposures or medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70650 \">table 2</a>) should be stopped in any patient who develops bronchiolitis. (See <a href=\"#H3935757\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically prescribe cough suppressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guaifenesin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guaifenesin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>) and inhaled bronchodilators for patients with cough related to bronchiolitis obliterans. Supplemental oxygen is provided according to current guidelines. (See <a href=\"#H192358484\" class=\"local\">'Symptom-based therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with bronchiolitis obliterans (constrictive), we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (200 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or another macrolide antibiotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The role of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in <strong>nontransplant</strong>-related bronchiolitis obliterans is unclear. Most case series have not found clear benefit, but a trial of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids following guidelines for asthma is reasonable for patients with clinical features that overlap with asthma.
