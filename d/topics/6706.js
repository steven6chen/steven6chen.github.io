Risk factors for strabismus include, but are not limited to, a positive family history and low birth weight (particularly those premature or low-birth-weight infants who have a history of retinopathy of prematurity or neurologic complications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. </p><p>Conditions that predispose to strabismus include vision deprivation (eg, corneal scars, cataracts, severe ptosis, and longstanding vitreous hemorrhage), muscular disorders, hyperopia, cerebral injury, anisometropia, amblyopia, and impairment of binocular fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Strabismus can even be a presenting sign of retinoblastoma when it involves the fovea and thus causes vision deprivation in an eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

As described above, ocular instability of infancy is the unsteady ocular alignment that is often sporadically present in normal newborns during the first few months of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudostrabismus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudoesotropia is the most common form of pseudostrabismus. It is the apparent esotropia that typically occurs in children with a wide nasal bridge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large epicanthal folds during the first few years of life. It is not a true strabismus, but rather an optical illusion in which the wide nasal bridge or epicanthal folds cover the nasal sclera making the eye appear esotropic, particularly when the child looks in lateral gaze (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70572\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70572 \">picture 1</a>). Normal ocular alignment is demonstrated by the corneal light reflex and the cover and <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> tests. The use of a diagram may help in explaining the concept of pseudoesotropia to the parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p>Pseudoexotropia also can occur. Pseudoexotropia is most commonly seen in children with temporal dragging of the macula secondary to retinal traction. Retinopathy of prematurity is the most common cause of pseudoexotropia; other causes include vascular abnormalities, choroiditis, macular scars, and other peripheral retinal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As with pseudoesotropia, pseudoexotropia can be differentiated from true strabismus with the <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> test and alternate cover test. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p>Pseudostrabismus can also be caused by orbital deformities or tumors that cause dystopia but not true strabismus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Strabismus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to distinguish between congenital and acquired strabismus, as some forms of acquired strabismus can be caused by a life-threatening or vision-threatening condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78228 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary strabismus entities include idiopathic infantile esotropia, intermittent exotropia, and the strabismus associated with various syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59573 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important causes of secondary strabismus include disorders causing poor central vision (ie, sensory strabismus caused by retinoblastoma, optic nerve hypoplasia, or macular scars), head trauma with secondary skew deviation or cranial nerve palsies, orbital fracture, myasthenia gravis, and Graves' disease.

It is most important to detect manifest deviations because they have greater potential to cause amblyopia, a functional reduction in the visual acuity of an eye caused by disuse or misuse during the critical period of visual development. Latent deviations are rarely associated with amblyopia. In addition, it is important to rule out causes of sensory strabismus that can be life threatening (eg, retinoblastoma); after leukocoria, esotropia is the most common presenting sign of retinoblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amblyopia in children: Classification, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinoblastoma-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinoblastoma: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating a child with ocular misalignment, the history focuses on characterizing the symptoms and identifying an underlying cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78228 \">table 2</a>). Questions to ask include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the <span class=\"nowrap\">developmental/birth</span> history?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of strabismus?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the deviation been present since early infancy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there any history of head or eye trauma?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there any other medical problems (eg, neuromuscular or genetic disorders)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of exposure to toxins or medications?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the duration and severity of the deviation?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When is the deviation present?

In this test, an accommodative target (eg, a small toy) is held several feet in front of the child's face, and a penlight is held next to the toy. If ocular alignment is normal, the light reflex is positioned centrally and symmetrically in each eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63631\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63631 \">figure 4</a>). Deflection of the corneal light reflex in one eye is noted if a moderate to large ocular misalignment is present. Each millimeter of deflection is associated with approximately 15 to 20 prism diopters of deviation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because the corneal light reflex test can overlook small deviations, it should be used in conjunction with the cover test and the <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Cover test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cover test is one of the most important tests used in the detection of manifest strabismus (tropia). In this test, the child is asked to visually fixate on a target at distance or near. The examiner briefly covers one eye while observing the opposite eye for movement. No movement is detected when covering either eye if the child has normal ocular alignment (orthotropia). Manifest strabismus (tropia) is present if the eye that is not occluded with the cover test shifts to refixate on the target when the fellow, previously fixating eye, is covered. The test should be repeated on each eye. The child should be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist if manifest strabismus is detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Cover/uncover test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> test is used to detect latent strabismus (phoria). If the cover test detects a tropia, the primary care provider need not perform additional testing with the <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> test since the abnormal cover test alone is sufficient basis for referral to an ophthalmologist. In the <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> test, the child is asked to visually fixate on a target at distance or near. A cover is placed over one eye for a few seconds and then it is rapidly removed. The eye that was under the cover is observed for refixation movement. If a phoria is present, this previously covered eye will shift back into the orthotropic (straight-ahead) position to re-establish sensory fusion with the other eye. If such movement is detected, latent strabismus is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68374 \">figure 5</a>). Latent strabismus is held in check by ocular fusion. Small, barely perceptible phorias are common and not pathologic. Large phorias can be associated with asthenopia (eye strain) and diplopia and should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Br&uuml;ckner test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Br&uuml;ckner test, also known as the simultaneous red reflex test, is another test that is useful in detecting small-angle strabismus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In this test, the examiner positions himself or herself 18 to 20 inches away from the child's face and uses a direct ophthalmoscope with the largest diameter of light to view both of the child's red reflexes simultaneously. The lenses on the ophthalmoscope are adjusted until the skin around the eyes is in focus, and the child's attention is directed at a target adjacent to the direct ophthalmoscope. This permits both pupillary red reflexes to be examined at the same time. They should be identical in size, shape, color, and brightness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66431\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66431 \">figure 6</a>). The child should be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist if a difference in any of the above between the two eyes is noted. Asymmetry of the red reflexes on Br&uuml;ckner testing may indicate a serious ocular disorder, including strabismus, significant anisometropia (imbalance of refractive error), or media opacity that is obstructing the visual axis (eg, cataract, anterior chamber or vitreous disorder, coloboma, or retinal tumor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Blood tests (including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuroimaging studies may be indicated, but are rarely required for routine strabismus.

Therapy may include the refractive error correction with prescription of glasses or contact lenses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occlusion therapy or pharmacologic or optical penalization of the preferred eye. In addition, surgical procedures may be necessary to correct conditions that obstruct the visual axis (eg, cataract, ptosis, hemangioma).

Observation with regular follow-up by an ophthalmologist every three to six months is appropriate for children in whom the deviation is small (ie, less that approximately 10 to 12 prism diopters), intermittent, and moderately or well controlled; and in whom fusion or stereopsis can be demonstrated. </p><p>Both surgical and non-surgical interventions are used to correct ocular alignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Non-surgical therapies include the prescription of spectacles or contact lenses, prism therapy miotic drops to manipulate accommodation, occlusion therapy, and visual training exercises (orthoptics).</p><p>Surgical procedures to improve ocular alignment include recession, resection, and transposition of the extraocular muscles and a variety of other procedures that are beyond the scope of this topic review.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraocular muscle recession involves repositioning of the muscle insertion posterior to the original insertion on the sclera, which effectively weakens its effect on globe position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraocular muscle resection involves shortening the muscle, which permits it to act as a passive restraint, effectively increasing its effect on globe position.</p><p/><p>As a general rule, recovery from strabismus surgery is rapid, and serious complications are rare. Nausea and vomiting are not uncommon on the first postoperative day and sometimes require treatment with antiemetics. Pain is typically mild and can be managed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>. A small amount of blood-tinged discharge from the operated eye(s) for the first 48 to 72 hours is normal. Postoperative subconjunctival hemorrhage and conjunctival injection typically resolve by two to three weeks after surgery. Temporary diplopia is not uncommon, but typically resolves after a few days. Less commonly, bacterial conjunctivitis can occur postoperatively; it is typically mild and readily clears with topical antibiotics. More serious postoperative infections, preseptal cellulitis and endophthalmitis, are rare. Warning signs of infection include marked chemosis and injection of the conjunctiva and lids, decreased vision, purulent discharge, and occasionally pain. Children who develop these findings should be seen by the ophthalmologist emergently.

Strabismus can occur in one or both eyes, and in any direction. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are six extraocular muscles in each eye that are responsible for eye movement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80501 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 1</a>). Evaluation of the cardinal positions of gaze helps the examiner isolate which extraocular muscle(s) are causing the strabismus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101135\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101135 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Neuroanatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major considerations in the differential diagnosis of strabismus in infants are pseudostrabismus and ocular instability of infancy, which are frequently present in normal newborns during the first few months of life. Pseudoesotropia is an optical illusion in which a wide nasal bridge or epicanthal folds obscure the nasal sclera (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70572\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70572 \">picture 1</a>). Normal ocular alignment is demonstrated by the corneal light reflex and the cover and <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> tests. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pseudostrabismus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older children, it is important to distinguish between congenital and acquired strabismus because some forms of acquired strabismus can be caused by a life-threatening or vision-threatening condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78228 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Strabismus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of the history include: <span class=\"nowrap\">developmental/birth</span> history; family history of strabismus; onset of deviation (eg, early infancy?); history of head or eye trauma; other medical problems (eg, neuromuscular or genetic disorders); exposure to toxins or medications; duration and severity of the deviation; whether the deviation is constant or intermittent and, if intermittent, what exacerbates it (eg, fatigue, positions of gaze); and other symptoms (headaches, abnormal head posture, diplopia, eye strain). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of the primary care provider's physical examination include assessment of general health and neurologic status, and the presence of abnormal head posture. The primary care provider's eye examination should include an assessment of visual function, pupillary reactivity, eyelid position, extraocular movements <span class=\"nowrap\">(ductions/versions),</span> corneal light reflex test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63631\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63631 \">figure 4</a>), cover test, <span class=\"nowrap\">cover/uncover</span> test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68374 \">figure 5</a>), and the Br&uuml;ckner simultaneous red reflex test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66431\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66431 \">figure 6</a>). In addition, the ophthalmologist's examination should be comprehensive and include cycloplegic refraction to determine if there is a need for refractive correction. This is especially important in esotropia to rule out accommodative esotropia.
