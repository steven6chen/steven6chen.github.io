Prognosis and treatment depend upon both the clinical symptoms and their duration, the location of the tumor within the brainstem, and, increasingly, the mutational profile. </p><p>Approximately 80 percent of pediatric brainstem gliomas arise within the pons, while the remaining 20 percent arise in the medulla, midbrain, or cervicomedullary junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53866 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. The majority of pontine tumors are diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas, which are usually high-grade, locally infiltrative, and have a uniformly poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Histologically, these tumors are usually anaplastic astrocytomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade III) or glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). However, patients with WHO grade II tumors identified by biopsy do not have an improved prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.) </p><p>By contrast, most nonpontine tumors involving the cervicomedullary junction and tectum, as well as focal, cystic, and dorsal exophytic lesions, are low-grade astrocytomas, mostly grade I pilocytic astrocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These are discrete, well-circumscribed tumors, often without evidence of locally invasive growth or edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of nonpontine gliomas will be high grade and are treated similarly to diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.</p><p>Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas will be reviewed here. Gliomas arising from other sites within the brainstem are discussed separately.

Brainstem gliomas are more common in children than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/3,4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11,12</a>]. In the United States, for example, there are approximately 300 pediatric cases and 100 adult cases reported each year. In children, the median age at diagnosis is five to nine years of age, and the incidence is approximately equal between males and females.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H992298657\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology and grade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used classification system for central nervous system tumors is that of the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Astrocytomas account for greater than 95 percent of all brainstem lesions. Most centers classify these tumors based on the WHO criteria, which encourage use of integrated and layered diagnoses to accommodate histologic and genetic parameters into a single diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109509 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H261416033\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'Histopathologic and molecular classification'</a>). For diffuse intrinsic pontine tumors, clinical and radiographic characteristics continue to be the most important predictors of outcome.</p><p>When biopsied, diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas are usually high-grade astrocytomas, although up to one-quarter appear low grade on classic histologic features, and nearly all tumors progress rapidly. Importantly, histopathologic grade does not correlate with prognosis in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and even low-grade diffuse pontine lesions behave aggressively and carry a similarly poor prognosis compared with high-grade tumors.</p><p>Glial tumors of the pons have rarely metastasized to distant sites at the time of diagnosis. Instead they tend to progress along established fiber tracts, especially into the thalamus and cerebellum. Spinal seeding is rare but can be observed in the end stages of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. With an average life expectancy of less than a year, the absence of metastatic disease may be the result of the rapidly fatal course of the primary tumor, rather than a lack of the metastatic potential of these tumors.</p><p>Tumors of the cervicomedullary junction, as well as focal and dorsal exophytic lesions, tend to be low grade based upon the WHO classification. When a high-grade component of one of these lesions is observed, the tumor tends to behave similarly to high-grade glial lesions in other parts of the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1035240859\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant insights have been gained into the molecular biology of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas using biopsy tissue and autopsy material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Despite similar histopathology, adult and pediatric diffuse gliomas are now recognized to contain distinct underlying genetic events.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutually exclusive mutations in either <em>H3F3A, </em>one of two genes<em> </em>encoding the histone H3.3 variant, or <em>HIST3BHI, </em>one of several genes encoding histone H3.1, have been identified in nearly 80 percent of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and appear to be present in all tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Both mutations involve a substitution of lysine 27 to methionine (H3 K27M), which results in altered binding of mutant histone H3 to polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a key developmental regulator of gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. <em>H3F3A</em>-mutant tumors may also harbor mutations in <em>PMM1D,</em> which alter the DNA damage response pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amplification and overexpression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) A and c-Met proteins seem to be important molecular events in the transformation of cells to a malignant phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], seen more commonly in H3.3-mutant tumors. Activating mutations in <em>PI3K</em> are identified in approximately 15 percent of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and seem to be more common in H3.1-mutant tumors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent somatic mutations in <em>ACVR1</em>, a gene that encodes a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 1 receptor, have been identified in up to one-third of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Mutations result in activation of the BMP pathway and increased expression of a variety of downstream effectors, including SMAD proteins and members of the <em>ID</em> gene family, which may represent potential therapeutic targets. These mutations are often associated with concurrent mutations in <em>PI3K</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>] and the H3.1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) or <em>IDH2</em>, which define a large proportion of adult grade II and III diffuse gliomas, are notably absent in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

As an example, pharmacologic inhibition of histone demethylation in a xenograft model of <em>H3F3A</em>-mutant brainstem glioma results in increased H3 K27M methylation and significant antitumor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2394381212\"><span class=\"h2\">H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant is a new diagnostic entity as of the 2016 revised version of the WHO classification of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As discussed above, approximately 80 percent of biopsied diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas harbor mutations at position K27 in one of several histone-encoding genes. (See <a href=\"#H1035240859\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>H3 K27M-mutant midline gliomas are high-grade gliomas, by definition WHO grade IV, associated with local infiltration and a uniformly poor prognosis, even when they have the histologic appearance of a low-grade glioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/13,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,34</a>]. Although the pons is the most common location, H3 K27M-mutant gliomas also occur in the thalamus, spinal cord, and other midline sites and can affect both children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The natural history and treatment implications of these tumors in locations outside the brainstem are not yet well defined.</p><p>Importantly, H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma is a pathologic diagnosis and is not synonymous with the clinical and radiologic entity of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, which does not require biopsy for diagnosis (and is often not biopsied) and behaves uniformly poorly, regardless of histologic grade or H3 K27M status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas can present with varied symptoms depending on the location of the lesion. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial nerve palsies, long tract signs (eg, hemiparesis), and ataxia in over 50 percent of patients.

Symptomatic hemorrhage may eventually occur in up to 20 percent of children, usually in necrotic areas of tumor.</p><p/><p>None of these symptoms are pathognomonic of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Other brainstem tumors can present with similar symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-brainstem-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal brainstem glioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervicomedullary tumors typically present with lower cranial nerve dysfunction and ataxia and have a prolonged clinical course, often progressing over years rather than days or weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal tumors tend to interfere with the cranial nerves adjacent to the site of origin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike other brainstem tumors, tectal plate lesions present with hydrocephalus in over 90 percent of cases. Although these tumors are rarely biopsied, those that have been studied are almost always low-grade astrocytomas.</p><p/><p>In contrast to focal brainstem gliomas, diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas usually present with a short duration of symptoms (typically less than three months). The duration of symptoms in the context of classic radiographic findings is an important predictor of prognosis in brainstem tumors. Patients with symptoms of greater than six months' duration at the time of diagnosis tend to do much better than patients with a shorter duration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-brainstem-glioma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal brainstem glioma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas have been reported in the neonate. Unlike supratentorial glioblastoma, which in infants has a significant proportion of long-term survivors, diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas in this age group appear to do as poorly as in those over the age of three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, spontaneous remissions have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROIMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and less frequently computed tomography (CT), are the standard method of diagnosis and classification for brainstem tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The brainstem is one of the most eloquent areas of the brain, making biopsy difficult in centers without expertise in this area. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.) </p><p>Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas have a typical appearance on CT scans with hypodense to isodense appearance, and variable contrast enhancement. Calcium is rarely identified within the tumor. MRI is superior to CT for defining these lesions. On MRI, diffuse pontine lesions are expansile, typically hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100714\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100714 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>High-grade tumors typically invade adjacent areas including the medulla or midbrain. Axial growth is commonly observed through the cerebellar peduncles and into the cerebellum, and the tumors expand the pons, instead of displacing it. They frequently have exophytic components into the prepontine cistern and often encircle the basilar artery. On sagittal images, the tumors appear to respect the pontomedullary boundary.</p><p>Contrast enhancement within the tumors can be variable and may be ring-enhancing with central areas of necrosis. The apparent well-circumscribed appearance of ring-enhancing lesions on MRI is often not confirmed at the time of surgery or autopsy and does not indicate a lower-grade lesion or more benign clinical course. Many diffuse pontine tumors have no contrast enhancement. Tumors that demonstrate diffuse uniform enhancement are more likely low-grade, are usually associated with prolonged symptoms, and may have a better outcome.</p><p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with estimation of choline to N-acetylaspartate (Cho:NAA) ratios is another noninvasive method that can be used to support the diagnosis and may provide prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In one series, children with a maximum Cho:NAA ratio greater than 4.5 had a median survival of 22 weeks, and all 13 patients died by 63 weeks. By contrast, the projected survival of patients with a Cho:NAA ratio &le;4.5 was significantly better, 50 percent at 63 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Other potentially useful techniques to further assist in nontissue-based diagnoses for brainstem tumors include rapid diffusion MRI, thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and positron emission tomography (PET) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As an example, 111In-pentreotide binds the somatostatin receptor, which is frequently expressed in gliomas. Scanning with this agent can both help support the diagnosis and, if labeled, potentially target radiation therapy to these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. While these methods continue to undergo further development and refinement, they are being used more frequently to assist MRI-based diagnosis, particularly in difficult or unclear cases.</p><p>While MRI has become the standard method of evaluation of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, the heterogeneous signal characteristics of these lesions and interobserver variability make serial assessment difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Evaluation of new therapies should therefore be based upon overall survival rather than MRI changes whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in imaging techniques and the difficulty in obtaining an adequate biopsy sample make the interpretation of the imaging studies critical in the differential diagnosis. If imaging findings are typical, biopsy is not usually necessary to confirm the diagnosis and should only be performed in the context of a formal clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>A long duration of symptoms and atypical clinical or imaging findings suggest the possible presence of a lesion other than diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Such patients should be considered for biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26802734\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular malformations, encephalitis, rare parasitic cysts, demyelinating disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis), and hamartomas in patients with neurofibromatosis are the most common causes of nontumorous lesions in the brainstem. Rare examples of metastases from extracranial carcinomas in adults have also been reported in the pons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of a patient with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma includes control of peritumoral edema, as well as specific measures directed at the tumor (surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). Participation in clinical trials is encouraged, particularly as the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors is unravelled and targeted therapies begin to enter clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H1035240859\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3133738929\" class=\"local\">'Investigational therapies'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of corticosteroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) is an important initial step in the treatment of patients with high-grade brainstem tumors. Peritumoral edema often contributes prominently to symptoms, which can improve rapidly after steroid therapy. Although steroids do not treat the underlying problem, improved clinical performance can be an important matter for quality of life in patients with a limited life span.</p><p>Unfortunately, many patients require prolonged administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, resulting in significant steroid-related complications. In some cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been used to modulate peritumoral edema without the complications of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The morbidity associated with surgery in this eloquent region of the brain and the sampling error associated with biopsies preclude routine biopsy to identify patients with lesions that are not high-grade astrocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/10,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,51,52</a>]. Pontine biopsy should only be performed by surgeons with expertise in this procedure and in the context of a clinical trial where the analysis will influence therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Adults are more likely to benefit from a stereotactic biopsy. In this setting, determining the final histologic grade (low- versus high-grade) may permit a more precise estimation of prognosis. In addition, up to 30 percent of biopsied patients had a diagnosis other than astrocytoma (eg, lymphoma, ependymoma, or infection) in studies that were completed both before and after availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Given the hazards of the surgical approach and rarity of brainstem lesions, referral to a highly specialized and dedicated neurosurgical team should be made before treatment is initiated, particularly for lesions that lack some of the classic clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imaging features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Advances in neurosurgical techniques have permitted biopsy of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas to be performed safely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In one series of 24 patients, diagnostic material was obtained in all. Two patients had transient neurologic deficits as a result of the biopsy but no permanent deficits resulted. In two patients, low-grade glial tumors were identified, which required modification of the treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Based on this study, pretherapy biopsy is being performed in the context of formal clinical trials to identify molecular pathways aberrant in these tumors and to use this information to guide treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy is the only treatment that appears to alter the clinical course of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Despite multiple trials of dose-escalation, altered fractionation, and radiosensitization, none of these modulations have been proven more effective than the conventionally delivered radiation therapy. These are reviewed below. Investigations with targeted therapies together with radiotherapy are ongoing. Radiation therapy treatment fields are typically restricted to the tumor volume plus 1 to 2 cm of adjacent brainstem tissue. The standard treatment dose is 1.8 Gy daily given five days per week, to a total dose of between 54 and 59.4 Gy. Patients with severe symptoms may require urgent initiation of radiation therapy.</p><p>Although the degree of tumor shrinkage induced by radiation therapy can be dramatic, the response is generally transient and patients are not cured by this approach. The median survival is approximately 10 months and the two-year overall survival rate is less than 10 percent.</p><p>In older studies, the duration of response was correlated with the tumor grade, as well as the bulk of disease, although this has not been demonstrated in more recent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The time to progression may be prolonged in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 and in children as compared with older adults.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly 80 percent of biopsied diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas harbor mutations at position K27 in one of several histone-encoding genes. Other important molecular changes in subsets of tumors include alterations in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), <em>PI3K</em> mutations, and recurrent somatic mutations in <em>ACVR1</em>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histopathologic grade does not correlate with prognosis in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and even low-grade diffuse intrinsic pontine lesions behave aggressively and carry a similarly poor prognosis compared with high-grade tumors. (See <a href=\"#H992298657\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology and grade'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of their location in an eloquent area of the brain, diagnosis is usually based upon imaging studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100714\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100714 \">image 1</a>) and classic clinical features. Surgery or surgical biopsy is not routinely indicated, unless atypical features are present or patients are part of a formal clinical study. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroids are used to control tumor-associated edema in symptomatic patients with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend external beam radiation therapy as the primary approach to antitumor therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Our typical approach is to give a total dose of 54 to 59.4 Gy, in fractions of 1.8 Gy five times per week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alternative radiation therapy techniques (hyperfractionation, radiation sensitizers, brachytherapy) have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Despite aggressive therapy, the prognosis remains poor, with an average survival of less than one year. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy does not have an established role in the management of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Currently, chemotherapy in conjunction with radiation therapy is considered investigational and should be provided in the context of a clinical trial. We recommend against use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Two phase II multicenter trials have found no benefit compared with historical controls, and the risk of side effects and toxicity is increased compared with radiation alone.
