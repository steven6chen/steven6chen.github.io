With evidence of benefit from several well-controlled studies, the National Autism Center's National Standards Report, a systematic review of the peer-reviewed behavioral and educational literature (1957-2007) considers intensive behavioral intervention to be an &quot;established&quot; treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-behavioral-and-educational-interventions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Intensive behavior programs may improve core symptoms of ASD and maladaptive behaviors but should not be expected to lead to typical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-behavioral-and-educational-interventions/abstract/10,11,14-16,19,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,14-16,19,35</a>]. The studies revealing the most gains for intensive behavior programs included a high level of intervention (eg, 30 to 40 hours per week of intensive one-on-one services for two or more years and starting before the age of five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-behavioral-and-educational-interventions/abstract/10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,36</a>].

However, there is empirical support for the use of certain strategies, particularly those based on Applied Behavior Analysis or general behavioral principles, to increase and maintain desirable behaviors, reduce maladaptive behaviors, teach new skills, and generalize behaviors to new environments or situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-behavioral-and-educational-interventions/abstract/3,35,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35,87</a>].</p><p>Educational interventions for adolescents should continue to include the core attributes of successful programs (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Attributes of successful programs'</a> above). The program should focus on achieving social competence, emotional and behavioral regulation, educational success, and the functional adaptive and vocational skills necessary for independence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-behavioral-and-educational-interventions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Transition planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By age 16 years, the individualized education program (IEP) for a child with ASD should include a plan for transition from child- to adult-oriented activities, but the process of transition planning should begin much sooner, as early as age 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-behavioral-and-educational-interventions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Comprehensive transition planning involves the student, parents, teachers, medical home, and community agencies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Children and youth with special health care needs&quot;, section on 'Transition planning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have varying degrees of impairment in social and behavioral function. Behavioral and educational interventions targeting core symptoms should be tailored to the child's specific needs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overarching goals of treatment are to maximize functioning, move the child toward independence, and improve the quality of life. Specific goals are to improve core symptoms and adaptive skills, decrease negative behaviors, and promote academic functioning and cognition. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practical and ethical factors have made it challenging to evaluate intervention programs for individuals with ASD in randomized controlled trials. Systematic reviews of behavioral and educational interventions for children with ASD suggest that earlier and more intensive therapies are associated with better outcomes. However, the evidence is insufficient to endorse any particular therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expert reviews of treatment programs for ASD have identified the following core attributes of successful programs (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Attributes of successful programs'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A high staff-to-student ratio (1:1 or 1:2)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individualized programming for each child</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Family involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Teachers with special expertise in working with children with autism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A minimum of 25 hours per week of services</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Functional analysis of behavior problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ongoing program evaluation and adjustment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Close monitoring and modification as the child's needs change</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A curriculum emphasizing attention, imitation, communication, play, and social interaction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A highly supportive teaching environment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Predictability and structure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transition planning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventional models for treatment may include a variety of techniques. Behavioral-based interventions and developmental models have support for efficacy, especially when provided early and intensively. However, it is important to monitor response to interventions and have clearly targeted symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Interventional models'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of parent-mediated interventions to other types of intervention may help families interact with their child, promote development, and increase parental satisfaction, empowerment, and mental health. However, which parental interventions maximize outcomes is unknown. In addition to providing direct interventions, general parental involvement in the treatment program is essential and should include parent training and collaboration. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parental role'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with ASD benefit most from language interventions that span settings and are incorporated into their daily routines. There is insufficient evidence to support a specific methodology (eg, traditional speech and language interventions, behaviorally based strategies, augmentative communication strategies, visual support), and a variety of methods may be used. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Communication interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions that address social skills deficits that have evidence of benefit from well-controlled studies include interventions that address joint attention, modeling, peer training, and story-based interventions; the long-term outcomes of these interventions is unclear. There is less evidence to support social and pragmatic groups, although these are used in clinical practice with success. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Social skills instruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional occupational therapy is often used to address deficits in adaptive functioning and fine motor skills. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Traditional OT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory integration therapy for children with ASD is controversial, and the evidence regarding its benefits is inconsistent. It may be warranted for specific indications (eg, to calm the child, reinforce desired behaviors, or help with transitions) within a comprehensive behavioral and educational program. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Sensory integration therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the strategies that are used to address the deficits in autism in preschool children may not be appropriate for toddlers or children with significant cognitive impairment, but early intensive therapy is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Programs for toddlers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Programs for older children and adolescents should focus on achieving social competence, emotional and behavioral regulation, and the functional adaptive and vocational skills necessary for independence. They should continue to include the core attributes of successful programs, including a plan for transition to adulthood.
