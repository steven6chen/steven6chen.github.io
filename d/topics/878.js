It is a severe defect and is not compatible with survival. Infants that are alive at birth generally die within hours, but occasionally survive for a few days or weeks. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of anencephaly are discussed in this topic review.</p><p>Anencephaly is one of the three major neural tube defects (NTDs). The others are encephalocele and myelomeningocele, which are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalocele is a herniation of the brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meninges through a defect in the skull (cranium bifidum) that is &quot;closed&quot; or covered with skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-congenital-encephalocele\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary (congenital) encephalocele&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelomeningocele is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324094\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The central nervous system (CNS) appears as a plate of thickened ectoderm called the neural plate at the beginning of the third week of embryonic life. The lateral edges of the neural plate become elevated to form the neural folds and fuse to form the neural tube; the fusion begins in the cervical region and proceeds in both the rostral and caudal directions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81711 \">figure 1</a>). The rostral neuropore closes on the 25<sup>th</sup> day after conception, and the caudal neuropore closes two days later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Neural tube defects (NTDs) result from failure of the neural tube closure between 25 and 27 days after conception. The embryology of the neural tube is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types#H19221419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed spinal dysraphism: Pathogenesis and types&quot;, section on 'Normal cord development in humans'</a>.)</p><p>Anencephaly is a severe defect of development of the neuraxis, in which the developing forebrain and variable amounts of the brainstem are exposed in utero and fail to develop or are destroyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Anencephaly results from failure of the rostral neuropore to close around postovulatory day 25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], whereas spina bifida results from failure of the caudal neuropore to close around postovulatory day 27.</p><p>The craniofacial abnormalities in anencephaly are caused by abnormal neural induction from prosencephalic and mesencephalic neural crest tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This mechanism is also seen in other anomalies of craniofacial development such as holoprosencephaly.</p><p>Craniorachischisis totalis is a related NTD, in which anencephaly is accompanied by a contiguous open defect of the spine (spina bifida totalis). It is an extreme example of defective closure of the neural tube during early embryogenesis, around 20 to 22 days gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324782\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to data from birth certificates reported to the National Center for Health Statistics, the prevalence of anencephaly in the United States in 2001 was 9.40 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. During 1999 to 2004, 2116 cases of anencephaly were reported in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Hispanic infants had the highest prevalence. The malformation is more common in girls than boys, in whites than blacks, and in mothers at the younger and older extremes of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of anencephaly in live births underestimates the actual rate of occurrence because of unknown numbers of spontaneous abortion or pregnancy termination of affected fetuses.</p><p>The birth prevalence of anencephaly decreased 20 percent between the 1999 to 2000 period and the 2003 to 2004 survey periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This decline is thought to be due to mandatory fortification of foods with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a>, which began in January 1998.</p><p>There is considerable variation in the rates of anencephaly and other NTDs worldwide, with particularly high prevalence in Ireland and the British Islands as compared with continental Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Rates in Asia and Africa tend to be lower, although there are pockets of higher prevalence in the northern provinces of China and in India, which are not easily explained by geographic or ethnic gradients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324789\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENCE RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of recurrence for NTDs (spina bifida or anencephaly) is approximately 2 to 4 percent when there is one affected sibling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. With two affected siblings, the risk is approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk of recurrence appears to be higher in countries such as Ireland where the prevalence of NTDs is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This familial clustering is due to genetic factors, environmental influences, or a combination of the two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The environmental influences that contribute to anencephaly risk are similar to those of other NTDs. (See <a href=\"#H13324831\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324796\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is accomplished by maternal screening of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and ultrasonography. Prenatal detection usually is followed by termination of the pregnancy.</p><p>The sonographic diagnosis of anencephaly is based upon the absence of brain and calvaria superior to the orbits on coronal views of the fetal head. The sonographic diagnosis of this condition is highly accurate and should be obvious on any routine second- or third-trimester ultrasound examination. Another sonographic feature is polyhydramnios, which develops in up to 50 percent of the cases during the second and third trimester due to decreased fetal swallowing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound diagnosis of neural tube defects&quot;, section on 'Anencephaly'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324803\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the most common type of anencephaly, the forebrain and variable amounts of upper brainstem are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Exposure in utero results in destruction of neural tissue, which appears as a hemorrhagic, fibrotic, nonfunctioning mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70158\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70158 \">picture 1</a>). Major portions of the CNS are absent or malformed. The hypothalamus is typically missing. The cerebellum, brainstem, optic nerves, and spinal cord may be malformed. Underdevelopment or absence of the pituitary leading to adrenal hypoplasia is always present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Large portions of the cranium are absent in this disorder. The frontal, parietal, and portions of the occipital bones are most often affected. The absent cranial vault results in the characteristic appearance of bulging eyes and absent neck. The defect in the skull sometimes extends through the level of the foramen magnum and involves the cervical spine. This abnormality is known as holoacrania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324810\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated malformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other congenital malformations frequently accompany anencephaly. In a registry of 456 affected stillborn and liveborn infants in British Columbia, additional malformations, including cleft lip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palate or omphalocele, occurred in 12.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Craniofacial and ocular anomalies often occur. Cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and skeletal malformations may be associated. Aganglionosis of the intestine is a frequent finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324817\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates with anencephaly typically have brainstem function, with spontaneous breathing and often with suck, root, and gag responses. However, they are permanently unconscious. Without intensive care, the majority of them die within two days of birth, and none survive longer than two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324824\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 75 percent of anencephalic infants are stillborn. Liveborn infants generally die within hours but occasionally survive for a few days or weeks. There are no neurosurgical management options. In most developed countries where abortion is legal these pregnancies are interrupted earlier. Therefore, prevention is the most important aspect of management of anencephaly.</p><p>Because of their poor prognosis, anencephalic infants have been considered as potential organ donors for transplantation. To assess the feasibility of this approach, one group modified the medical care of 12 liveborn anencephalic infants for one week to determine whether organ viability could be maintained and whether the criteria of total brain death could be met. Among six anencephalic infants who received intensive care during the first week after birth, organ function was maintained, but five were not candidates for organ donation because they had persistent brainstem activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anencephaly/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among six other infants who did not receive intensive care during the first week of life, most organs were damaged, precluding organ donation. These findings suggest that anencephalic infants are not good candidates for organ donation because they do not generally meet criteria for brain death until their clinical condition has declined to the point where the solid organs are damaged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13324831\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several lines of evidence suggest a link between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> deficiency and the development of neural tube defects (NTDs) including anencephaly. Risk factors for NTDs include dietary deficiency of folic acid, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> or folic acid antagonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a>, and genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding folate-dependent enzymes. Moreover, randomized trials have consistently shown that folic acid supplementation reduces the incidence of NTDs.</p><p>Other contributors to NTD risk that are probably not related to folate metabolism include maternal diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control during the first trimester, hyperthermia, and some genetic syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Treatment failures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-of-a-diabetic-mother#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant of a diabetic mother&quot;, section on 'Congenital anomalies'</a>.)</p><p>Periconceptional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> supplementation is recommended for all women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. Higher doses of folic acid supplements are usually recommended for women who are taking anticonvulsant drugs or who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a NTD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13325264\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anencephaly is a severe defect of development of the neuraxis, in which the developing forebrain and variable amounts of the brainstem are exposed in utero and destroyed or fail to develop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70158\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70158 \">picture 1</a>).
