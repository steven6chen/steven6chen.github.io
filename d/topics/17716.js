In addition, the prevalence of anti-HCV antibody is higher among patients on hemodialysis compared with healthy populations, suggesting that dialysis patients may be at higher risk of acquiring HCV infection. In fact, the prevalence of a positive HCV antibody test in the hemodialysis population in the United States is 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Antiviral treatment in these patients can be complicated because many of the agents used for anti-HCV therapy can accumulate to toxic levels in the setting of renal impairment. Thus, patients with renal disease and chronic HCV infection represent an important population that warrants specific consideration. </p><p>It is anticipated that the management of HCV in adults with significant kidney disease (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) will undergo substantial changes over the near future due to the availability of new direct-acting antiviral agents. New HCV medications have allowed for interferon-free, and in some cases, ribavirin-free treatment regimens in patients without renal impairment. However, these agents have to be studied in the patient populations with kidney disease before they can be adopted for widespread use in this historically difficult-to-treat population.</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to antiviral therapy of HCV-infected patients with renal impairment. However, other management issues, such as immunosuppressive therapy as well as treatment of proteinuria and hypertension or other complications of renal disease, may be important in such patients. Discussions of renal disease associated with HCV infection, the epidemiology and prevention of HCV infection among dialysis patients, and HCV infection associated with renal transplantation are found in detail elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of renal disease associated with hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-patients-on-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in patients on maintenance dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in kidney donors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C infection in kidney transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1907695881\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main reason for antiviral treatment in patients with chronic HCV infection is to prevent liver complications. In the patient with advanced chronic kidney disease who is a potential kidney transplant candidate, an additional reason is to prevent kidney transplant-related complications specific to HCV infection. In the less common scenario of HCV related vasculitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glomerulonephritis (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia), an additional rationale for antiviral treatment is to eradicate the immunologic stimulus (ie, HCV itself) for the vasculitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glomerulonephritis.</p><p>The main sequelae of chronic HCV infection usually develop over the span of decades and include cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Eradication of HCV prior to the development of decompensated cirrhosis results in decreased all-cause mortality, liver-related death, need for liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma rates, and liver-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/3-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-13</a>].

For patients who have renal disease related to HCV, successful antiviral therapy is also associated with an amelioration of the extrahepatic complications of HCV infection. In several studies of patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mixed cryoglobulinemia, improvements in the cutaneous vasculitis, cryoglobulin titers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69711 \">figure 1</a>), proteinuria, and in the plasma creatinine concentration were observed in the majority patients who achieved HCV viral suppression on interferon-based treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/14-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-28</a>]. In one study of 14 patients, protein excretion fell among viral responders from 6.1 to 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> while there was a lesser, non-statistically significant reduction in protein excretion in nonresponders (6.1 versus 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Cessation of interferon therapy resulted in recurrence of viremia and vasculitis in most patients in these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/14,16,17,19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17,19,29</a>]. This observation suggests that the efficacy of interferon is directly related to its antiviral activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In general, when patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and HCV are treated for HCV and achieve a sustained virologic response, the mixed cryoglobulinemia and its renal manifestations usually (but not always) resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As the treatment paradigm for HCV infection has moved away from interferon-containing regimens in all patients, including those with kidney disease and mixed cryoglobulinemia, case reports and series have emerged demonstrating the efficacy of newer direct-acting antiviral agents in the treatment of HCV and mixed cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].</p><p>Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis deserve eventual antiviral treatment. Much less is known about the extrahepatic effects of successful antiviral treatment of HCV associated glomerulonephritides without mixed cryoglobulinemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1907695888\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to deciding on antiviral treatment for patients with kidney disease is evolving. Prior to the availability of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) agents that could be safely used in patients with kidney disease, including those on dialysis, deciding to treat these patients represented a management challenge. With non-DAA-based regimens (ie, standard or pegylated interferon with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>), the efficacy of antiviral therapy was suboptimal, and the potential toxicity of therapy was high, depending on the extent of renal impairment and the comorbid conditions. As new DAAs that can be used safely in patients with kidney disease, including those on dialysis, are being introduced, the decision to treat HCV infection is becoming less challenging. For those in whom a DAA-based regimen is appropriate, we agree with the guidelines from the AASLD and IDSA that recommend treatment for all patients with chronic HCV infection except those with short life expectancies due to comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The feasibility of a DAA-based regimen and the estimation of life expectancy differs by severity of renal impairment, as below. (See <a href=\"#H51072114\" class=\"local\">'Mild or moderate renal impairment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H51072120\" class=\"local\">'Severe renal impairment or dialysis'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with renal impairment from HCV-associated vasculitis or glomerulonephritis, another important management consideration is whether immunosuppressive therapy is also indicated. The selection of patients who should also receive immunosuppressive therapy and the suggested immunosuppressive regimens are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome#H17909481\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;, section on 'Immunosuppressive therapy for severe mixed cryoglobulinemia'</a>.) </p><p>Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral treatment in general is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51072114\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild or moderate renal impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the vast majority of patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) who have access to newer generation DAA agents, a highly effective interferon-free regimen with minimal toxicity is available. Thus, we treat such patients who otherwise do not have major limitations to life expectancy. Particular prioritization of antiviral treatment is given to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, those with significant HCV-related kidney disease from mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and those with HCV-related glomerulonephritis. The exact regimen depends on genotype, presence or absence of cirrhosis, and prior treatment history. When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> is required as part of the regimen, dose reductions should be made according to the eGFR. (See <a href=\"#H1907695951\" class=\"local\">'Regimen selection'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 2 and 3 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-4-5-and-6-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 4, 5, and 6 infection in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51072120\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe renal impairment or dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe renal impairment (ie, eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or on dialysis, decisions to provide these patients with HCV treatment should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis. We agree with the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, which state that the anticipated benefits and risk of HCV therapy, life expectancy, comorbidities, and potential for kidney transplant candidacy be taken into account when making the decision to treat HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The first step is to assess life expectancy. In many cases, individuals with renal impairment and incidental HCV infection (ie, the renal disease is not associated with HCV) have significant comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which have contributed to the development of or coexist with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the setting of advanced CKD and with such competing comorbidities, it is difficult to determine whether treatment of chronic HCV infection would actually provide the patient with a survival benefit. Considerations about life expectancy for patients with advanced CKD on hemodialysis who are not kidney transplant candidates should be made individually.</p><p>In contrast, patients with HCV-related renal disease are likely to experience improvement in renal function and symptoms related to renal failure with successful treatment, and in the authors' opinion, treatment is warranted even if life expectancy may otherwise be limited due to other comorbidities.</p><p>If it is determined that the life expectancy should not preclude antiviral treatment, the next step is to assess whether prompt treatment is indicated. Although DAA-based regimens are feasible for many patients with severe renal impairment, we reserve HCV antiviral therapy to those who are most likely to benefit from it in the short term. These include patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, patients who are renal transplant candidates, those with significant HCV related kidney disease from mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and those with HCV-related glomerulonephritis. For patients with vasculitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glomerulonephritis that warrant immunosuppressive therapy, another consideration is the timing of antiviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1907695895\" class=\"local\">'Timing of treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The threshold for treatment also depends on the options for treatment, which in turn depend in part on the genotype. As an example, the threshold is lower for genotypes 1 and 4 infection because of the option of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbasvir-and-grazoprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elbasvir-grazoprevir</a>, which has phase III clinical trial evidence for efficacy and safety in renal impairment. The threshold is higher for genotypes 2, 3, 5, and 6 infection, given the uncertainties about safety with sofosbuvir-containing regimens and thus the potential need for interferon-based regimens for treatment of these genotypes. (See <a href=\"#H1907695951\" class=\"local\">'Regimen selection'</a> below.)</p><p>Decisions to treat patients with severe renal impairment and decompensated cirrhosis are more complicated, as most treatment trials of patients with decompensated cirrhosis have excluded those with eGFR &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These patients should be managed&nbsp;by an expert in the care of such patients, preferably at a transplant center. (See <a href=\"#H885581843\" class=\"local\">'Decompensated cirrhosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1907695895\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of antiviral therapy is relevant for patients who have HCV-related renal disease as well as for patients with end stage renal disease awaiting transplant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602866320\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with HCV-associated renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe, acute vasculitic manifestations associated with HCV infection immunosuppressive therapy may be warranted. We initiate immunosuppressive therapy first and delay antiviral therapy for one to four months. This approach is in agreement with the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Italian Group for the Study of Cryoglobulinemias (GISC) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Immunosuppressive therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome#H17909481\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;, section on 'Immunosuppressive therapy for severe mixed cryoglobulinemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of renal disease associated with hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although these recommendations were formulated prior to the availability of newer direct-acting antiviral agents, there are still limited data on the efficacy and safety of these agents with concomitant use of potent immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, we continue to favor initiation of immunosuppression for severe vasculitic sequelae <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HCV related renal disease before starting antiviral medications.</p><p>The rationale for delaying antiviral therapy by one to four months in patients who require immunosuppressive therapy is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy can rapidly improve inflammation and resolve target organ damage. Clinical improvements due to antiviral therapy are gradual. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose immunosuppressive therapy and antiviral therapy each have side effects. Thus, patients may not be able to tolerate both treatments simultaneously. This rationale will become less important as the field moves towards interferon-free regimens for all genotypes. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602866359\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney transplant candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HCV infection who are expected to require kidney transplant and are candidates for antiviral therapy could undergo treatment prior to kidney transplantation, if feasible. </p><p>However, kidney transplantation should not be prohibited if HCV patients without advanced liver fibrosis have not yet been treated. If willing, such patients may also be able to receive a kidney from a HCV positive donor. Utilizing hepatitis C positive kidney donors could decrease wait time and decrease wait-list mortality if used more uniformly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Interferon-free treatment can be undertaken post-transplant under the guidance of an experienced clinician, although some agents have drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H1907704959\" class=\"local\">'Kidney transplant'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C infection in kidney transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1907695944\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL EFFICACY AND SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large registration trials of agents used for the treatment of chronic HCV infection have generally excluded patients with significant renal impairment, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glecaprevir-and-pibrentasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbasvir-and-grazoprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elbasvir-grazoprevir</a>. Much of the data on antiviral efficacy in the setting of severe renal impairment is with standard interferon, which, in the general population, is substantially less effective than regimens that are currently standard of care. Additionally, there are no data directly comparing the efficacy of antiviral therapy in patients with and without significant renal impairment. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that patients with renal impairment can expect a virologic response rate to a given regimen similar to that observed in the general population, as long as the regimen is tolerated. </p><p>In the United States and elsewhere, many new direct-acting antiviral regimens are currently available, and additional agents are expected. Experience with the use of these newer agents in patients with chronic kidney disease is variable and will be reviewed below.

In the largest study on this topic, 18 percent of liver transplant recipients had renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)<sup> </sup>five years after transplantation. Risk factors for post-liver transplant renal disease include pre-transplant renal dysfunction, perioperative renal failure, early allograft dysfunction, infections, and most importantly, calcineurin inhibitors. The management of renal disease in such patients is discussed elsewhere.

We agree with the joint guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) that recommend a direct-acting antiviral-based regimen for liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

In a study of 100 liver or kidney transplant recipients (80 of whom were liver recipients) without cirrhosis, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for 12 weeks resulted in an SVR rate of 98 percent without serious adverse events leading to drug discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Although patients with severe renal impairment were not included in this study, the safety of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir in the setting of renal impairment is well documented.

For patients with renal impairment, additional reasons are to prevent HCV-associated kidney transplant complications in those who are transplant candidates and to eradicate an immunologic stimulus in those who have HCV-related vasculitis or glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H1907695881\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for antiviral treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to treat HCV in patients with renal impairment should be made on a case by case basis. Multiple host factors contribute to this decision, including extent of renal impairment, the extent of liver disease, and the presence of comorbidities that affect the potential toxicity of antiviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1907695888\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe, acute vasculitic manifestations associated with HCV infection, we initiate immunosuppressive therapy first and delay antiviral therapy for one to four months. For patients who are expected to require kidney transplant and are candidates for antiviral therapy, we initiate antiviral therapy so that it is completed prior to kidney transplantation if possible. However, kidney transplantation should not be prohibited in untreated HCV-infected patients without advanced fibrosis, as patients can receive effective interferon-free HCV treatment post transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1907695895\" class=\"local\">'Timing of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Much of the data on antiviral efficacy in the setting of severe renal impairment is with standard interferon, which is substantially less effective than regimens that are currently standard of care for the general HCV-infected population, with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates less than 50 percent. It is unclear if peginterferon provides additional efficacy over standard interferon in the setting of severe renal impairment, but the combination of peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> is more effective than peginterferon alone. Limited data on the use of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens among patients with severe renal impairment suggest comparably high efficacy as seen in the general population. (See <a href=\"#H1907695944\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral efficacy and safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with renal insufficiency, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> accumulates and can cause severe anemia. Ribavirin should therefore be used with caution and dose reduction in patients with mild renal insufficiency. The use of ribavirin in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment is controversial. We use it in such patients only with a low starting dose, close monitoring of the hemoglobin level, aggressive dose reductions for anemia, and adjunctive use of erythropoietic growth factors. (See <a href=\"#H1693270499\" class=\"local\">'Safety of ribavirin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical data are limited on the safety of most DAA agents in the setting of severe renal impairment. Most agents are metabolized hepatically. The main concern is with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a>, which is renally eliminated. (See <a href=\"#H3577299823\" class=\"local\">'Regimens with direct-acting antivirals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The selection of the antiviral regimen among patients with renal disease depends upon the extent of renal impairment in addition to the genotype, extent of underlying liver disease, and history of past antiviral treatment. Despite the limited data on DAA-based regimens in severe renal insufficiency, we favor these over interferon-based regimens. (See <a href=\"#H1907695951\" class=\"local\">'Regimen selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, regimen selection is the same as that for patients without renal impairment.
