Although initially described in 1849 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], it was not recognized as a distinct clinical entity until the 1930s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Earlier terms for this condition include toxic postpartum HF, Meadows&rsquo; syndrome, Zaria syndrome, and postpartum myocardiosis.</p><p>This topic will discuss the etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PPCM. Treatment and prognosis of PPCM, critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period, HF during pregnancy, and issues related to pregnancy in women with acquired or congenital heart disease are discussed separately.

We favor the definition developed by the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Working Group on Peripartum Cardiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The Working Group sought to avoid under-diagnosis of PPCM by adopting a broad definition (which was also included in the 2011 ESC guidelines on management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. </p><p>The 2010 ESC Working Group defined PPCM as an idiopathic cardiomyopathy with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of heart failure (HF) toward the end of pregnancy or within five months following delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of another identifiable cause for the HF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 45 percent.

The term pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy (also known as early pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy) has been used to describe this condition. The characteristics of early-onset disease were evaluated in a review of 123 women with a history of cardiomyopathy diagnosed during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One-hundred women met the traditional criteria for PPCM, presenting at a mean of 38 weeks, and 23 presented earlier at a mean of 32 weeks. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of age, race, associated conditions, LVEF (29 versus 27 percent), the rate and time of recovery, and maternal outcomes. These observations suggest that patients with an early presentation are likely part of the spectrum of PPCM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large prospective international registry of 411 women from 43 countries has demonstrated that PPCM occurs globally, affecting women from all ethnicities on all continents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, incidence rates vary widely depending on geographical location.

Also, the incidence of PPCM may be higher as milder forms may be missed. </p><p>The wide range in reported incidence may reflect an overestimation in studies that rely solely on clinical criteria to make the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H947517023\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). There may also be differences in search criteria and a lack of chart review when large national registries are used. The high incidence in Nigeria may be related to a local Hausa custom of eating kanwa, a dry lake salt for forty days after delivery. It has been suggested that the development of PPCM in these patients may be related in part to hypervolemia and possibly hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22,23</a>].

While a number of potential factors have been evaluated and may contribute, experimental research suggests that these multiple factors result in a common final pathway with enhanced oxidative stress, cleavage of prolactin to an angiostatic N-terminal 16 kDA prolactin fragment, and impaired vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling because of upregulated soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFLT1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,15,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292685\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiogenic imbalance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from studies in mice and humans suggest that PPCM may be caused by systemic angiogenic imbalance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26-28</a>]. Mice that lack cardiac PGC-1&alpha;, a regulator of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, develop severe PPCM. The PPCM is rescued by dual pro-angiogenic therapy (VEGF plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>). </p><p>These data may also explain why preeclampsia and multiple gestations are risk factors for PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. During late gestation, the human placenta secretes VEGF inhibitors such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFLt1), which also damages the vasculature, with higher levels seen with multiple gestation or preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among women with preeclampsia, subclinical cardiac dysfunction (as detected by the myocardial performance index) correlates with sFlt1 levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292787\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of prolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Altered prolactin processing is involved in the pathogenesis of PPCM. Mice with a knockout in the cardiac tissue-specific signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) develop PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Reduction in STAT3 leads to increased cleavage of prolactin into an antiangiogenic and proapoptotic 16kDa isoform by cathepsin D. Thus, alterations in prolactin processing may contribute to the angiogenic imbalance described above. (See <a href=\"#H292685\" class=\"local\">'Angiogenic imbalance'</a> above.)</p><p>The 16 kDa prolactin fragment (16K PRL) also causes endothelial damage and myocardial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. 16K PRL induces microRNA-146a expression in endothelial cells, which leads to most of the anti-angiogenic effects of 16K PRL. Women with PPCM have elevated levels of microRNA-146a compared with healthy postpartum women or women with other cardiomyopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>, an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, prevents the development of PPCM in these mice.

The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated 11 African women in Nairobi who presented with the clinical features of PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Endomyocardial biopsies in five patients were consistent with a &quot;healing&quot; myocarditis. Of the nine patients with at least six months follow-up, three of four with myocarditis had persistent HF, while four of five with no or sparse evidence of myocarditis had improvement in HF symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular (LV) size and function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two other series, myocarditis was present in 4 of 14 and 14 of 18 patients with PPCM, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In comparison, myocarditis was present in only 5 of 55 patients (9 percent) in a comparator group with an idiopathic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 26 patients with PPCM who had evidence of interstitial inflammation, viral genomes were noted in eight (31 percent). Viral genomes have also been noted in other forms of myocarditis.

This incidence was comparable to that found in an age- and sex-matched control population undergoing transplantation for idiopathic DCM (9.1 percent).</p><p>The reason for the discrepancy among the various studies is unclear. In addition to small sample size, the timing of biopsy in relation to the onset of symptoms may also be important, since the incidence of inflammation is greater in patients who are biopsied soon after presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>]. Other potential reasons for the variability of the prevalence of myocarditis include: the inclusion of patients outside the accepted time frame of PPCM, variability among patient populations, and limitations of endomyocardial biopsy as a means of diagnosis of myocarditis. These limitations include sampling error (since myocardial involvement may be patchy) and variability in histologic criteria for myocarditis (ie, whether patients with borderline myocarditis were included together with those with active myocarditis as defined by the Dallas criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been suggested that a maternal immunologic response to a fetal antigen can lead to PPCM. Fetal cells may escape into the maternal circulation and remain there without being rejected due to weak immunogenicity of the paternal haplotype of the chimeric cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. If these cells lodge in the cardiac tissue, they can trigger a pathologic autoimmune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>High titers of autoantibodies compared with controls have been described against normal human cardiac tissue proteins (including myosin), adenine nucleotide translocator, and branched chain alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,43</a>]. In addition, the immunoglobulins in patients with PPCM may be significantly different in frequency and reactivity to those in DCM cohorts and healthy donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In contrast to these findings, a study of humoral immunity in 39 Nigerian women with PPCM found no difference compared with controls in the levels of serum immunoglobulins, circulating immune complexes, or cardiac muscle antibodies between subjects and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Overall, the available data are insufficient to establish whether abnormal maternal immunological response is the cause of PPCM.

Familial clustering of PPCM together with DCM has been observed and DCM-associated mutations have been identified in some patients with PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. A study examined sequences of 43 genes with variants associated with DCM in each of 172 women with PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Twenty-six distinct truncating variants were identified in eight genes. The prevalence of truncating variants (26 of 172 or 15 percent) was similar to that seen in a cohort of patients with DCM (17 percent) but significantly higher than that seen in a reference population (4.7 percent). Two-thirds of identified truncating variants were in TTN, which encodes the sarcomere protein titin. Seven of the TTN-truncating variants were known to be associated with DCM. In a subgroup of 83 patients, the presence of a TTN-truncating variant was significantly correlated with lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at one-year follow-up. In fact, some patients with PPCM and these TTN-truncating variants may be presenting with an initial manifestation of familial DCM. Studies have reported that women with a family history of DCM have poorer recovery rates than those without a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47</a>].<strong> </strong></p><p>African genomic ancestry may be a risk factor for the development of PPCM and explain the high prevalence of PPCM in Haiti, Africa, and black women in the United States. It may also explain why black patients have a delay in recovery of LVEF and a higher proportion do not recover to an LVEF greater than 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].<strong> </strong>It has been demonstrated that the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins beta-3 subunit (GNB3) has a polymorphism called C825T [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, low plasma renin, and cardiac remodeling. It has a prevalence of 50 percent in black individuals compared with 10 percent in white individuals. In a study of 97 women of whom 30 percent were black, the GNB3 TT genotype was associated with lower LVEF at 6 and 12 months in women with PPCM. Given the higher frequency of this genotype in black individuals, it is felt that it likely contributes to the lower LVEF recovery noted in black women with PPCM.</p><p>PPCM may also develop in female carriers of X-linked forms of cardiomyopathies such as Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy and Danon disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,52,53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, there is a 40 to 50 percent increase in blood volume and cardiac output, which results in transient LV remodeling and hypertrophy. It is possible that there is an exaggerated remodeling response with decrease in LV systolic function in women who develop PPCM. The hemodynamic stress of gestational hypertension, which is more common in women with PPCM, may contribute to the development of HF, though an angiogenic imbalance may better explain the association between preeclampsia and PPCM.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H84779113\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of PPCM is unknown, with possible causes including angiogenic imbalance, altered prolactin processing, genetic, inflammatory, hormonal, hemodynamic, and autoimmune factors. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of risk factors for PPCM have been identified, including greater age, multiple gestation, African descent, and a history of preeclampsia, eclampsia, or postpartum hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of PPCM is variable and similar to that in other forms of systolic heart failure due to cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The echocardiogram generally reveals global reduction in LV systolic function with LVEF nearly always &lt;45 percent. The LV is frequently but not always dilated.
