The appropriate therapy for SAH depends in part upon the severity of hemorrhage. Level of consciousness on admission, patient age, and the amount of blood on initial head computed tomography (CT) scan are the most important prognostic factors for SAH at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subarachnoid-hemorrhage-grading-scales/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A number of grading systems are used in practice to standardize the clinical classification of patients with SAH based upon the initial neurologic examination and the appearance of blood on the initial head CT. This topic will provide an overview of the more commonly used clinical and radiologic grading scales for SAH. Treatment and other aspects of SAH are discussed separately.

The GCS is not a true SAH grading scale, but is rather a standardized method for evaluating the level of consciousness in a number of neurologic conditions including SAH. The GCS assigns points based on three parameters of neurologic function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye opening (spontaneous = 4, response to verbal command = 3, response to pain = 2, no eye opening = 1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Best verbal response (oriented = 5, confused = 4, inappropriate words = 3, incomprehensible sounds = 2, no verbal response = 1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Best motor response (obeys commands = 6, localizing response to pain = 5, withdrawal response to pain = 4, flexion to pain = 3, extension to pain = 2, no motor response = 1)</p><p/><p>In a prospective series of 765 patients with SAH, a higher GCS correlated with better outcome after aneurysm surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subarachnoid-hemorrhage-grading-scales/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, a significant difference in outcome was observed only between patients with GCS scores of 15 and 14, while no significant differences were found between the remaining adjacent GCS scores.</p><p>The interobserver variability of the GCS for patients with SAH is moderate (kappa 0.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subarachnoid-hemorrhage-grading-scales/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The GCS has been incorporated into several additional SAH grading systems.

As an example, a rare presentation of SAH may include severe headache (ie, Grade 2), normal level of consciousness, and severe hemiparesis (ie, Grade 4).

In a study assessing a series of 185 patients with SAH, the Hunt and Hess score correlated more strongly with outcome at six months than the GCS or World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subarachnoid-hemorrhage-grading-scales/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In a single prospective study, patients with Ogilvy and Carter grades 2, 3, and 4 had statistically worse outcomes compared with those in the adjacent lower grade. Interobserver variability for the Ogilvy and Carter scale is very good, reflecting substantial observer agreement. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ogilvy and Carter grading system'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subarachnoid-hemorrhage-grading-scales/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hijdra A, van Gijn J, Nagelkerke NJ, et al.
