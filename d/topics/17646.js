As a result, almost all patients should be treated, even those who are asymptomatic and those in whom the disorder does not seem to be progressing. One exception is a patient with a short life expectancy who is not expected to live long enough to benefit from therapy.</p><p>The treatment of acromegaly will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acromegaly are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy in patients with acromegaly are to lower the serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration to within the normal range for the patient's age and gender, control adenoma size and reduce mass effects, improve symptoms, and reverse metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;, section on 'Metabolic'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to lowering IGF-1, another biochemical goal is to lower the serum growth hormone (GH) concentration to &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> as measured by immunoradiometric or chemiluminescent assay, as this also correlates with control of acromegaly. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the IGF-1 criterion may be better since some patients who appear to have active disease clinically and by elevated IGF-1 concentration have serum GH values that suppress to &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Serum IGF-1 concentrations also correlate better than serum GH with insulin sensitivity in patients with acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H56212924\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When serum GH and IGF-1 concentrations decline to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the characteristic soft tissue overgrowth and related symptoms gradually recede and the metabolic abnormalities, such as diabetes mellitus, improve. In addition, life expectancy returns to that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, bony abnormalities generally do not regress and joint symptoms persist. (See <a href=\"#H3315970343\" class=\"local\">'Amelioration of symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms due to the direct effects of the somatotroph adenoma (headaches, vision loss), without causing hypopituitarism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689545547\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A summary of treatment effects is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55079 \">table 1</a>). The choice of initial treatment depends upon the size and location of the adenoma, the presence of symptoms due to size (such as impairment of vision), and the patient's ability to undergo surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116165\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116165 \">algorithm 1</a>). The approach outlined here is similar to the Endocrine Society's 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1122883082\"><span class=\"h2\">Transsphenoidal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the majority of patients with acromegaly, we recommend transsphenoidal surgery as the initial therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116165\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116165 \">algorithm 1</a>). This includes patients with a microadenoma, a macroadenoma that appears to be fully resectable, or a macroadenoma causing impairment of vision. We also recommend that transsphenoidal surgery be performed by a neurosurgeon with considerable experience in pituitary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses#H21308014\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas and other sellar masses&quot;, section on 'Somatotroph adenomas (acromegaly)'</a>.)</p><p>We suggest <strong>surgical debulking</strong> for patients with macroadenomas abutting or adjacent to the chiasm (followed by medical therapy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116165\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116165 \">algorithm 1</a>). Medical treatment may be more effective after surgical debulking.

Long-term deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones has been reported in up to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Patients treated with both surgery and radiation are particularly prone to develop pituitary hormonal deficiencies, including growth hormone (GH) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4236941880\" class=\"local\">'Should GH deficiency be treated?'</a> below.)</p><p>Other major complications of surgery occur in approximately 8 percent of patients. These include central diabetes insipidus (2 percent), cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (2 percent), and meningitis (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. All are more common in patients with macroadenomas.</p><p>These complication rates reflect results from neurosurgeons with the most experience with transsphenoidal surgery. Rates with less experienced surgeons are much higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2299947389\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early cure rate in patients with acromegaly is 80 to 90 percent for microadenomas and less than 50 percent for macroadenomas (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Surgical cure rate'</a> below). We measure insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and a random growth hormone (GH) approximately 12 weeks after surgery as it may take this long for IGF-1 to normalize; a decision can then be made whether adjuvant therapy should be initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116165\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116165 \">algorithm 1</a>). If a random GH is &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> we remeasure GH after a glucose load; a post-glucose serum GH less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> is consistent with control of acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The early cure rate in patients with acromegaly is 80 to 90 percent for microadenomas and less than 50 percent for macroadenomas. (See <a href=\"#H56212924\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical outcomes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Surgical cure rate'</a> below.)</p><p>We also suggest performing a pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study at least 12 weeks after surgery to look for residual tumor and assess adjacent structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116165\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116165 \">algorithm 1</a>). It is important to wait 12 weeks to allow for involution of gel foam and fat packing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172923319\"><span class=\"h4\">Normal IGF-1 and no residual tumor on MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If transsphenoidal surgery results in normalization of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration and no evidence of residual tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we suggest no further therapy.

We often use a somatostatin analog first because it tends to decrease the size of the adenoma, as well as its secretion of GH. Pegvisomant is another option for medical therapy in this setting. If a somatostatin analog is started first and treatment does not reduce IGF-1 levels to normal, we recommend adding pegvisomant, which blocks the action of GH.
