Flexible bronchoscopy is used for a growing number of diagnostic and therapeutic indications such that the clinician should be aware of the potential value of this procedure for their patient. </p><p>The general principles of patient preparation, as well as the procedural technique and complications of flexible bronchoscopy are reviewed here. The equipment, indications, contraindications, and procedures that can be performed using a flexible bronchoscope are described separately.

This involves discussing the potential complications, benefits, and alternatives of the planned procedure and the type of sedation (moderate versus general anesthesia). Questions should be answered. Implied consent is acceptable when the bronchoscopy is emergent, the patient is incapable of giving consent due to altered mental status, and a surrogate decision maker is unavailable (eg, removal of a foreign body causing life-threatening airway obstruction). In such cases, the clinician should carefully document the reason that the informed consent is not possible and indicate why the emergent procedure is medically necessary.

These patients usually have an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube that is connected to the ventilator. A special adapter is necessary for such procedures to avoid any air leak so that the patients can be adequately mechanically ventilated during the bronchoscopy. The adaptor allows the flexible bronchoscope to be inserted through the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube while the patient is being ventilated. </p><p>Similarly, special masks are available for patients on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) so that continued NIV can be administered while patients are undergoing bronchoscopy to avoid any leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-preparation-procedural-technique-and-complications/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, bronchoscopy while on NIV is not commonly performed in the United States. </p><p>It is important to check and make sure that equipment is in the room and is functional prior to administering sedation. This check can be done during the &quot;universal time-out&quot; procedure. (See <a href=\"#H3510156359\" class=\"local\">'Pre-procedural universal protocol'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717925769\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical airway anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After informed consent has been obtained and the setup complete, the patient is usually brought into the procedure or operating room unless they are in the intensive care unit or emergency department. It should be confirmed that the patient has not had anything to eat or drink during the six hours prior to the administration of topical airway anesthesia. The patient is then placed on continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitors, supplemental oxygen is administered (generally 2 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> by nasal cannula), and intravenous access is established. The oropharynx and both nasal passages are generally anesthetized topically which takes 15 to 20 minutes to perform:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oropharynx</strong> &ndash; The upper airway (oropharynx, vocal cords, and trachea) is typically anesthetized by aerosolizing topical anesthetic (usually 1 or 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, occasionally 4 percent) so that the gag reflex is inhibited during bronchoscopy. This can be done using a nebulizer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> manual spray which deposit anesthetic into the posterior oropharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-preparation-procedural-technique-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasal</strong> &ndash; The nasal passage is also typically anesthetized by squirting anesthetic gel (usually 1 to 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) into the nostril using a 1 or 2 mL slip-tip syringe. The patients may be asked to sniff the gel into the nostrils. A cotton tip swab covered with topical anesthetic gel is then gently inserted into the nostril (using a twisting motion) until it reaches the back of the nasopharynx. This maneuver also helps identify for the operator whether or not the bronchoscope can easily pass through the nasal passage which is the preferred route for entering the tracheobronchial tree. It is important during this latter step not to force the swab in order to avoid inducing an episode of epistaxis. (See <a href=\"#H876897868\" class=\"local\">'Entering the tracheobronchial tree'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>For patients who are intubated or have a tracheostomy in place, the monitors are typically already in place and the physician must be assured that enteral has been discontinued for at least six hours. Some experts administer 1 to 2 mL of topical anesthesia (eg, 1 or 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) via the endobronchial tube (ETT), although this practice is variable and not well validated. In addition, topical anesthesia to the nasal passages is sometimes done in intubated patients when parts of the oropharynx above the ETT or tracheostomy tube need to be visualized. </p><p>When an oral route is planned, a bite block is placed in the mouth to prevent the patient from damaging the bronchoscope by accidental biting. However, topical anesthesia of the oropharynx is still necessary and topical anesthesia of the nasal passage is also often performed in case the nasal route becomes necessary if the oral route fails. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2227557760\"><span class=\"h2\">Route of entry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The route of entry is usually pre-planned. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasal</strong> &ndash; The nasal route is preferred in most non intubated patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral</strong> &ndash; Choosing an alternative route depends upon factors including nasal bleeding risk and size or abnormalities of the nasal cavity (eg, presence of polyps, edema, septal deviation). As an example, in patients with thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, small nasal cavities, or obstructing polyps, the nasal route is generally avoided and the oral route is preferred. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endotracheal devices</strong> &ndash; For patients who are intubated with an ETT or have a tracheostomy tube in place, the bronchoscopist will enter the tracheobronchial tree via the <span class=\"nowrap\">ETT/tracheostomy</span> device usually at mid-level trachea. Thus, visual inspection of the upper airway is bypassed. Occasionally, when upper airway obstruction or oropharyngeal lesions is suspected in this population, the bronchoscope can be passed through the nose and mouth as for a non-intubated patient. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both the bronchoscope and <span class=\"nowrap\">ETT/tracheostomy</span> size should be taken into consideration. Typically an endotracheal device with an inner diameter of 7.5 mm or greater is needed for most patients who undergo bronchoscopy with a conventional bronchoscope. If not feasible, alternatives are to change the device or use a smaller bronchoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ventilator alarm settings and the fraction of inspired oxygen will need to be increased to accommodate the increased airway pressure and reduction in oxygenation that typically occurs during bronchoscopy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngeal mask airways (LMA)</strong> &ndash; Laryngeal mask airways (LMA) are being used during flexible bronchoscopy. It is not as invasive as an ETT (as it is placed above the vocal cords) and can maintain adequate ventilation during a procedure with longer duration. As an example, endobronchial ultrasound and many interventional bronchoscopic procedures use LMAs. Similar to ETTs, the bronchoscope is passed through the LMA and the bronchoscopist enters the tracheobronchial tree at the level of the vocal cords. When LMAs are used, the epiglottic aperture bars (if present) are typically cut prior to LMA insertion to facilitate passage of the bronchoscope. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3510156359\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-procedural universal protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The universal pre-procedural and time-out protocol should be performed prior to beginning the procedure. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pre-procedure verification process requires that the clinician confirm that the correct patient is present and that the correct procedure is about to be performed on the correct site. In addition, the clinician must confirm that all of the relevant documentation (eg, history and physical exam, documentation of allergies, signed consent form) and radiologic studies are available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The time-out requires that each member of the procedure team agree that the patient, procedure, and site are correct. Documentation of the time-out is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bronchoscopist or operator should confirm with the team that all equipment necessary for the procedure is available and functional.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is a good practice to communicate any potential risks (eg, fire if laser is used or if there is high risk for bleeding) with the team and have the appropriate plan and supportive personnel in place (eg, anesthesiologist and thoracic surgeon).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3257540215\"><span class=\"h1\">SEDATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate sedation (previously known as conscious sedation) is generally used during bronchoscopy. Sedation should not be initiated until the procedure room is prepared, equipment checked, the time-out is done, the upper airway is anesthetized, and all required personnel are present. Agents typically used include short-acting benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) and opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>).

Antibiotics may be prescribed if the fever continues for more than 24 hours since bacterial infection can complicate bronchoscopy. Chest radiography may not be helpful in distinguishing transient fever from that due to infection since radiographic abnormalities are common following bronchoscopy especially when BAL has been performed. Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely required except for patients with a prosthetic valve or history of endocarditis, and asplenic patients.

This includes ongoing assessment and documentation of alertness, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxyhemoglobin saturation. The patient is not allowed to eat for a minimum of 1 to 4 hours after the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Discharge criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Inpatients should return to their baseline functional and physiological status prior to returning to the inpatient ward. Once they are back on the inpatient ward, personnel should monitor them for return of their gag reflex (assuming that they had a gag reflex prior to the procedure). Eating and drinking can be resumed once the gag reflex returns (up to 1 to 4 hours). The goal is to ensure that the patient is able to eat and drink without aspirating.</p><p>Outpatients should be alert and oriented, have stable vital signs, have returned to baseline ambulation status, and have controlled nausea and vomiting before being discharged. We also monitor patients for return of their gag reflex and, once their swallowing reflex returns, we evaluate their eating or drinking prior to discharge.</p><p>For patients who are intubated, vital signs are routinely monitored and ventilator settings should be slowly weaned to the original settings. </p><p>Chest radiography is routinely performed in those in whom a transbronchial biopsy was performed (preferably in expiration) and in those in whom barotrauma is suspected.

Ideally, the bronchoscopy team should include an experienced bronchoscopist, a nurse, and a technician. All equipment and materials necessary to perform the procedure, administer sedation, and manage the airway should be set up and functional prior to the bronchoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H891151336\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H672453366\" class=\"local\">'Informed consent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1757948217\" class=\"local\">'Equipment and supplies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible bronchoscopy must be performed in a monitored setting including an endoscopy suite, operating room, emergency department, postoperative anesthesia care unit or intensive care unit. Intravenous access should be established, cardiorespiratory monitoring started, supplemental oxygen administered, and the upper airway anesthetized. The route of entry is usually pre-planned, with the nasal route being the most common. The universal pre-procedural and time-out protocol should be performed prior to beginning the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1717925769\" class=\"local\">'Topical airway anesthesia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2227557760\" class=\"local\">'Route of entry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3510156359\" class=\"local\">'Pre-procedural universal protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate sedation is generally used during flexible bronchoscopy. Sedation should not be initiated until the procedure room is prepared, equipment checked, the time-out is done, the upper airway is anesthetized, and all required personnel are present. Agents typically used include short-acting benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) and opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>).

Advanced diagnostic procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound and therapeutic procedures including laser resection, argon plasma coagulation, photodynamic therapy, electrocautery, cryosurgery, balloon dilatation, brachytherapy, stenting, valve placement, and bronchial thermoplasty can also be performed using a flexible bronchoscope.
