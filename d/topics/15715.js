The written record of occupational lung disease caused by silica inhalation extends back to ancient Egypt and Greece. Despite a clear understanding of how to prevent this disease, new cases of silicosis continue to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentations, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of silicosis will be reviewed here. The imaging of occupational lung disease and the evaluation of pulmonary disability are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of occupational lung diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-pulmonary-disability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of pulmonary disability&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H288862875\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical presentations of disease have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute silicosis &ndash; Acute silicosis, also known as acute silicoproteinosis, develops after exposure to high concentrations of respirable crystalline silica and results in symptoms within a few weeks to a few years after the initial exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic silicosis &ndash; Chronic silicosis usually has the radiographic pattern described below as simple silicosis. In a minority of those with chronic disease, nodules coalesce resulting in progressive massive fibrosis (PMF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simple silicosis &ndash; Simple silicosis is characterized radiographically by innumerable, sharply marginated, small rounded opacities composed of hyalinized, collagenous nodules, with a predilection for dorsal aspects of the upper lobes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progressive massive fibrosis &ndash; PMF, also known as complicated or conglomerate silicosis, is characterized by nodular lung lesions 1 cm or greater in diameter that have radiating strands extending out from the nodule. These nodules can contain air bronchograms and calcifications. The lesions of PMF occur predominantly in the upper lung zones of the chest radiograph. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated silicosis &ndash; Accelerated silicosis is associated with high-level exposure to silica and develops within 10 years of initial exposure. Accelerated silicosis is differentiated from chronic disease only by its more rapid development following first exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Workers in a broad range of industries are exposed to crystalline silica (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55812 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/4,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-10</a>]. Up to 200,000 miners and 1.7 million non-mining workers in the United States have experienced significant occupational exposure to inhaled silica, and new cases of silicosis are recognized worldwide every year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Among hard rock miners, radiographic evidence of silicosis is present in approximately one-third. The rate of positive chest radiographs correlates at least in part with the degree of dust exposure, although other factors such as race may play a role. African Americans have a two to seven times higher rate of developing silicosis compared with white workers with the same dust exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>It is estimated that there were between 3600 and 7300 cases per year of silicosis in the United States between 1987 and 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. During that decade, nearly 3000 deaths were attributed to silicosis in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The overall mortality attributable to silicosis has decreased substantially in the United States over the past 30 years, largely because of improved workplace protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. From 1968 to 2002, silicosis was recorded as an underlying or contributing cause of death on 16,305 death certificates; of these, 15,944 (98 percent) deaths occurred in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. From 1968 to 2002, the number of silicosis deaths decreased from 1157 (8.91 per million persons aged <em>&ge;</em>15 years) to 148 (0.66 per million), corresponding to a 93 percent decline in the overall mortality rate. Subsequently, the Centers for Disease Control assessed deaths in the United States found an overall gradual decrease from 164 (0.<span class=\"nowrap\">74/million</span> persons aged <em>&ge;</em>15 years) in 2001 to 101 (0.<span class=\"nowrap\">39/million</span> persons aged <em>&ge;</em>15 years) in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMS OF SILICA AND MECHANISM OF TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Silica (silicon dioxide) is the most abundant mineral on earth. Silica exists in both crystalline and amorphous forms. Amorphous forms, including vitreous silica and diatomite (formed from skeletons of prehistoric marine organisms), are relatively nontoxic after inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, inhaled crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite) is associated with a spectrum of pulmonary diseases.</p><p>Quartz is the most common type of crystalline silica and is a major component of rocks including granite, slate, and sandstone. Granite contains about 30 percent free silica, slate about 40 percent, and sandstone is almost pure silica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Cristobalite and tridymite occur naturally in lava and are formed when quartz or amorphous silica is subjected to very high temperatures. </p><p>The toxicity of crystalline silica appears to result from the ability of crystalline silica surfaces to interact with aqueous media, to generate oxygen radicals, and to injure target pulmonary cells such as alveolar macrophages. Resultant generation of inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor beta) by target cells lead to cytokine networking between inflammatory cells and resident pulmonary cells, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>&quot;Free&quot; crystalline silica is unbound to other minerals. &quot;Combined&quot; forms of silica, called silicates, are compounds in which silica is bound to other minerals. Examples of silicates used in industry include asbestos (hydrated magnesium silicate), talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2), and kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), a major component of kaolin (china clay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The pulmonary effects of asbestos inhalation are substantial, and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SILICA IN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any occupation that disturbs the earth's crust or involves processing or using silica-containing rock or ores has potential risk for silicosis. The history of occupational exposure to silica should include the types and duration of employment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55812 \">table 1</a>), dust levels, and use of effective respiratory protection. Determining whether the worker's occupational silica exposure is sufficient to cause silicosis can be difficult. Silicosis can occur in many industries and work settings including mining, quarrying, sandblasting, masonry, foundry work, and ceramics. Occupations that involve crushing or grinding of quartz-containing materials are also hazardous.</p><p>Current workplace exposure limits in the US are not fully protective of all exposed workers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-pulmonary-disability#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of pulmonary disability&quot;, section on 'History and physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mining and hydraulic fracturing</strong> &ndash; Underground mining for coal or metal can cause silicosis, particularly when tunneling through rock with high silica content or when using sand as a friction material on rails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Although dust exposure levels are generally lower in surface and strip mines, silicosis also occurs in these settings, particularly among drillers and their assistants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Exposure to respirable silica has also been described in hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas recovery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sandblasting</strong> &ndash; Sandblasting generates respirable aerosols of silica and is associated with an especially increased risk for silicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. The very high risk associated with sandblasting may be due to generation of freshly fractured silica particles, which appear to be particularly toxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. High rates of silicosis have also been described in Turkish workers using silica to sandblast denim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34</a>]. The United Kingdom restricted use of abrasives containing silica in 1949, and other European countries abandoned sandblasting during the 1960s. In contrast, there are no special restrictions on the use of sand for abrasive blasting in the United States, except in the underground mine environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Foundry work</strong> &ndash; Foundry workers can have significant exposure to aerosolized silica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In foundries, metal castings are made by pouring molten metal into molds. These molds generally contain finely milled quartz sands, and exposure to respirable crystalline silica aerosols occurs both when the mold is knocked off the cast and when the cast is cleaned or polished. These aerosols often contain cristobalite, which is formed as a result of the intense heat associated with producing casts and is particularly toxic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Masonry</strong> &ndash; Production of silica flour, sand, concrete, and silica-based ceramics are also associated with an increased risk of silicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/4,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,38-41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other settings</strong> &ndash; The short list of high-risk industries specifically noted above is not complete, as silicosis can occur in many dusty settings, even ones where risk was not previously appreciated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55812 \">table 1</a>). As an example, nine cases of silicosis were confirmed among dental laboratory technicians in the United States between 1994 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other occupations (eg, agriculture, highway repair) in which the soil is disturbed can lead to significant exposures to respirable silica in airborne soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/4,39,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,39,42,43</a>]. Although occupation is the major risk factor for silicosis, rare cases have been reported of chronic silicosis after environmental exposures in regions where soil silica content is high and dust storms are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363392039\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE SILICOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute silicosis develops after exposure to high concentrations of respirable crystalline silica and results in symptoms within a few weeks to a few years after the initial exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/3,45-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,45-50</a>]. Acute silicosis is rare; most individuals with extremely high silica exposures initially display radiographic features identical to those of simple silicosis, which progress to progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) over a period of as few as four to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/45,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,48</a>]. The reason that some individuals develop acute silicosis while others develop accelerated silicosis after overwhelming silica exposure is not known; genetic factors may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/6,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,51,52</a>].

These symptoms may precede significant radiologic findings. On physical examination, crackles are usually present. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363392076\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When acute silicosis is suspected due to the onset of cough, dyspnea, and sometimes fever or pleuritic chest pain in a patient with high dose exposure to silica in the recent past (eg, months to a few years), the evaluation is aimed at documenting the exposure history and excluding other processes in the differential diagnosis, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia, lipoid pneumonia, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

The opacities may be perihilar or basilar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. These features may progress from a pattern of lower zone opacities to large masses of coalesced parenchymal tissue in the mid and lower zones, which are typically bilateral but not always symmetrical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/45,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases#H952818812\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of occupational lung diseases&quot;, section on 'Silicosis'</a>.)</p><p>The high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings consist of numerous bilateral centrilobular nodular opacities, focal ground glass opacities, and patchy areas of consolidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In a small series that compared pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and acute silicosis, the most common HRCT finding in PAP was &ldquo;crazy paving&rdquo;, while the most common finding in acute silicosis was dependent consolidation and nodular calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In acute silicoproteinosis, BAL yields a thick, opaque (milky) effluent similar to that seen in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. On cytologic examination, the macrophages in the BAL are foamy and the lipoproteinaceous material stains brightly positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Silicotic nodules are rarely seen, and, if present, are usually poorly developed. As described for BAL fluid, proteinaceous material fills the alveoli and consists largely of phospholipids or surfactant (or surfactant-like material) and stains with PAS reagent. The interstitium is thickened with inflammatory cells; a minimal amount of pulmonary fibrosis is typically present. Alveoli may be lined with prominent epithelial cells, the majority of which are hypertrophic type II pneumocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In addition, desquamated pneumocytes, macrophages, and silica particles are found in the alveolar spaces. The histologic appearance of acute silicosis resembles that of idiopathic alveolar proteinosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76748\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76748 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

A lung biopsy is not necessary in the setting of a definite exposure history and these characteristic findings. </p><p>Once lipoproteinaceous fluid has been obtained by BAL or observed on biopsy, other causes of alveolar proteinosis or lipidosis are usually identified by history of inhalational exposure (eg, titanium, indium-tin oxide, or aluminum), testing for GM-CSF antibodies, lipid-laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (suggest lipoid pneumonia), stains <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cultures obtained from bronchoscopy (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii or Nocardia), or presence of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood.

It is not uncommon for the radiographic appearance of silicosis to occur many years after cessation of employment in a job associated with exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The progressive coalescence of silicotic nodules leads to replacement of upper lobe parenchyma by the nodules and air trapping and emphysema in the lower lobes due to fibrotic retraction of the upper lobes with resultant respiratory impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H288863049\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of chronic silicosis is variable. Individuals with simple silicosis may be asymptomatic with the only manifestation being an abnormal chest radiograph.

As a consequence of better industrial hygiene practices, silicosis afflicts far fewer people in the United States than in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The 2016 proposed Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for respirable silica is a time weighted average of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/m<sup>3</sup></span> over an eight hour shift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/135-137\" class=\"abstract_t\">135-137</a>]. The proposed standard also includes other requirements for exposure assessment, methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and record-keeping. A number of studies suggested that the previous PEL of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/m<sup>3</sup></span> was not protective of workers with exposure over an entire working lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/24,63,138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,63,138,139</a>].

Above this concentration of crystalline silica, powered respirators are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p>Although primary prevention through exposure control is the critical component of silicosis prevention, health monitoring of workers with exposure to respirable crystalline quartz using chest radiographs and spirometry may assist in the early identification of people developing disease from their exposures. Efforts at secondary prevention only work if there are effective interventions resulting in reductions of quartz exposure for affected workers and others comparably exposed. Many industrialized countries mandate health surveillance for workers at risk of developing silicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. A number of NIOSH publications are available addressing such issues as awareness of silica as a workplace hazard, environmental controls, personal protection, and medical monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silicosis/abstract/143-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">143-145</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The crystalline forms of silica (eg, quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite) are associated with a spectrum of pulmonary diseases known collectively as silicosis. Workers in a broad range of industries (eg, sandblasting, mining, masonry, foundry work, glass and ceramic manufacturing) are exposed to respirable silica (silicon dioxide) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55812 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Forms of silica and mechanism of toxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Silica in the work environment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three patterns of silicosis have been described. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute silicosis, also known as acute silicoproteinosis, develops after exposure to high concentrations of respirable crystalline silica and results in symptoms within a few weeks to a few years after the initial exposure. Symptoms include cough, weight loss, fatigue, and sometimes pleuritic pain. It is associated with a bilateral alveolar filling pattern, similar to that of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. (See <a href=\"#H363392039\" class=\"local\">'Acute silicosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H363392082\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic silicosis (includes simple silicosis and progressive massive fibrosis) has multiple, upper lung zone nodules that are rounded and less than 10 mm in diameter. It typically appears 10 to 30 years after exposure. Progressive massive fibrosis refers to coalescence of the nodules of chronic silicosis in association with hilar lymphadenopathy and calcification. Presentations vary from asymptomatic radiographic findings to progressive respiratory insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Chronic silicosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Accelerated silicosis develops within 10 years of the initial exposure and is associated with high level exposure. The radiographic pattern is that of simple silicosis although the development of radiographic abnormalities is more rapid. Patients with accelerated silicosis are at greater risk for progressive massive fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Accelerated silicosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute silicosis is based upon the history of an acute, high dose silica exposure, imaging findings of diffuse nodular and patchy consolidative opacities, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) effluent that is milky and lipoproteinaceous, and exclusion of other potential explanations (infection, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia, primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis). (See <a href=\"#H363393466\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of chronic silicosis is based on the combination of a history of sufficient respirable silica exposure to cause the clinical findings, a compatible chest radiograph, and the absence of an alternative explanation. Lung biopsy is reserved for situations in which a confident clinical diagnosis cannot be made (eg, insufficient occupational exposure history, imaging suggestive of malignancy or infection). (See <a href=\"#H288861788\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all forms of silicosis, further exposure to silica should be avoided or minimized, if complete avoidance isn&rsquo;t possible. No specific therapy has been established for any form of silicosis. Symptomatic therapy includes smoking cessation (if needed), treatment of airflow limitation with bronchodilators, vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus, and use of supplemental oxygen (if indicated) to prevent complications of chronic hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"#H288861795\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole lung lavage may be an option for patients with acute silicoproteinosis and progressive respiratory failure, based on the known benefits in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and limited data in acute silicoproteinosis. (See <a href=\"#H363392100\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Whole lung lavage'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced silicosis and no contraindications may be candidates for lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H288865363\" class=\"local\">'Lung transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions associated with silicosis include mycobacterial and fungal infection, airflow obstruction, chronic bronchitis, rheumatic disease, and lung malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H363393784\" class=\"local\">'Other conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As there is no proven therapy for silicosis, efforts should be directed towards prevention through a comprehensive lung health protection program focused on exposure avoidance and use of personal protective equipment.
