In contrast, children presenting with nonheritable retinoblastoma typically have unilateral and unifocal disease, have a negative family history, and usually present at a later age.

The most important risk factor for developing ROP is prematurity. However, more than 50 separate risk factors have been identified. ROP causes leukocoria only when ROP is severe and results in tractional retinal detachment (stage 4, 5). Bilateral and symmetric presentation, tractional retinal detachment, and a history of prematurity are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis.</p><p>ROP is discussed in greater detail separately.

Uveitis (pars planitis) is an occasional cause of leukocoria in patients with inflammatory or infectious retinal diseases such as toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus retinitis. Large vitreous seeds from retinoblastoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99878\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99878 \">picture 11</a>) can also mimic the inflammatory &quot;snowballs&quot; of pars planitis.
