Initially, rubella was thought to be a variant related to measles or scarlet fever and was called the &quot;Third Exanthematous Disease of Childhood&quot; or the &quot;three day measles&quot;. In 1866, Veale, a Scottish clinician serving as an English Royal Artillery surgeon, proposed changing the name to rubella, from the Latin &quot;little red&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The viral etiology of rubella was suspected by Hess in 1914 based on experiments of inoculating monkeys with blood obtained from children with acute manifestations of rubella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This was later confirmed by the transmission of filtered secretions from individuals with acute rubella to susceptible children by Hiro and Tosaka in 1938 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The Australian ophthalmologist Norman McAlister Gregg first made the seminal observation of the teratogenic effects of rubella in 1941 by describing the association of congenital cataracts with maternal rubella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Subsequently, rubella infection during early gestation was associated with the devastating array of congenital defects comprising the congenital rubella syndrome. This led to the development of live-attenuated rubella vaccines</p><p>In countries employing mass immunization campaigns and recommendations for universal immunization of children, rubella cases and congenital rubella cases declined precipitously. In regions of the developing world lacking rubella immunization programs, a high proportion of women of childbearing age remain susceptible to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>].</p><p>The microbiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of rubella will be reviewed here.

The family name Togavirus comes from &quot;toga&quot; or &quot;ring,&quot; since electron microscopy demonstrates a characteristic lucent ring between the nucleocapsid core and envelope with a unique, helical outer surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Rubella virus is the only member of the Rubivirus genus. Its genomic structure and replication process are similar to those of the alphaviruses. In contrast to the alphaviruses, however, humans are the only natural host, though experimental rubella virus infection may be induced in a range of vertebrate animals.</p><p>Rubella virus's positive-sense, single-stranded RNA encodes three structural proteins: C, E1, and E2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These proteins are encoded as a single precursor on a 24S subgenomic mRNA and cleaved by cellular peptidases. The capsid protein, C, surrounds the RNA of the virion while the glycosylated proteins, E1 and E2, form transmembrane spikes and serve as the major antigenic sites of the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].</p><p>Attachment of the virus occurs at the cell surface, and cell entry likely occurs by transportation into endosomes mediated by specific cellular receptors. The cellular receptor for rubella virus has not yet been elucidated, but the virus's wide tissue tropism suggests membrane phospholipids and glycolipids may be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Viral replication takes place in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Virus particles assemble on intracellular membranes. The mechanism of virus release from cells remains undefined, but the cytoplasmic domain of E1 is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].</p><p>Rubella virus can be grown in many primary and continuous cell lines derived from human, non-human primate, and other vertebrate tissue. Induction of apoptosis appears to be the primary mechanism by which cytopathic effect (CPE) is produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, identification and quantification of rubella virus in these cell lines are commonly problematic because the CPE is often minimal and variable. Identification is more reliably accomplished by antigenic and molecular assays, such as immunofluorescence and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Rubella virus's replication in tissue culture also may be detected by its ability to interfere with the replication of another virus for which the cell line is sensitive (ie, interference).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND VACCINE DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the development and introduction of rubella vaccine, outbreaks of rubella occurred variably every few years, peaking in the winter and early spring in temperate areas. The incidence tended to be highest among school-age children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1962, rubella virus was first isolated in cell culture, allowing for the development of attenuated strains for candidate vaccines. Three live-attenuated vaccines were licensed in the United States in 1969 to 1970: HPV-77 grown in duck embryo cells, HPV-77 grown in dog kidney cells, and Cendehill vaccine grown in rabbit kidney cells. Use of these vaccines resulted in a precipitous fall in the number of reported rubella cases.</p><p>The RA <span class=\"nowrap\">27/3</span> vaccine, grown in human diploid fibroblasts, was licensed in Europe in 1971-1972. The RA <span class=\"nowrap\">27/3</span> vaccine provides better individual protection, herd immunity, and fewer adverse joint manifestations. Thus, RA <span class=\"nowrap\">27/3</span> became the single vaccine licensed in the United States in 1979 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].</p><p>Accurate estimates of the number of cases of rubella in the United States were not possible until rubella and congenital rubella syndrome became nationally notifiable diseases in 1966 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70446\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70446 \">figure 1</a>). In 1964-1965, over 12 million cases of rubella and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome were recorded. In 1969, just before the introduction of the vaccine, the reported incidence of rubella was 58 cases per 100,000 populations. By 1983, fewer than 0.5 cases per 100,000 populations were reported. Resurgence of rubella occurred during 1990 and 1991 due to outbreaks in California and Pennsylvania. The lowest number of cases reported annually was seven, in 2003. In 2004, rubella was officially declared eliminated from the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In 2015, rubella was officially declared eliminated from the Americas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Global occurrence of rubella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of rubella vaccine generally correlates with a country's economic development. At the end of 2002, rubella immunization existed in 100 percent of industrialized nations, in 71 percent of countries with economies in transition, and in 48 percent of developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In 2006, 123 (58 percent) of 212 countries and territories had national immunization programs for rubella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, outbreaks of rubella may still occur in countries that have a national immunization program if there is a substantial proportion of the population that remains susceptible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. As an example, Japan introduced rubella vaccination for adolescent females in 1976 and for all children aged one to six years in 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although the number of cases remained low from 2000 until 2010, the incidence of rubella subsequently increased rapidly, such that over 8500 cases were reported in the first five months of 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Most of these cases were in men aged 20 to 49 years, a subset of the population that was not included in the initial rubella vaccination. While the majority of cases were reported in the Kanto area, which includes Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures, the epidemic progressively spread throughout Japan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period of rubella is usually 14 to 18 days (range 12 to 23 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/17,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23,24</a>]. Rubella is acquired via inhalation of infectious large particle aerosols and thus is augmented by close and prolonged contact with infected individuals. Initial replication occurs in nasopharyngeal cells and regional lymph nodes. Viremia occurs five to seven days after inoculation, allowing the virus to spread throughout the body. The virus can be isolated from the pharynx and blood during this period and on occasion may be isolated subsequently from a number of other sites including synovial fluid, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Infected individuals may shed virus and are potentially contagious for one to two weeks before the infection becomes clinically apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In many cases, rubella infection is asymptomatic, and the shedding and infectiousness of the infected individual is never recognized. With the appearance of the rash, typically 14 to 17 days after exposure, viral shedding decreases concurrent with the development of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the rash has been postulated as being immune-mediated.</p><p>IgG antibodies produced after rubella infection provide protective immunity, but reinfection can occur. Re-exposure can produce a significant rise in the pre-existing titer, but rarely results in detectable viremia or risk to a developing fetus. A few cases of fetal infection following maternal reinfection have been reported, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of postnatally acquired rubella are generally mild, and many cases are subclinical or asymptomatic. Illness among children tends to be milder than illness among adults, with fewer prodromal symptoms and complications.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of postnatal rubella infection among children typically include the acute onset of a maculopapular rash with minimal systemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/13,15,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,23,25</a>]. Low grade fever and lymphadenopathy may occur concurrently or one to five days prior to the appearance of the exanthem. The lymphadenopathy characteristically involves the posterior cervical, posterior auricular, and suboccipital lymph nodes.</p><p>The exanthem consists of pinpoint, pink maculopapules. The rash first appears on the face, spreads caudally to the trunk and extremities, and becomes generalized within 24 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61263\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61263 \">picture 1</a>). The rash usually is evident for about three days, but may last only one to two days or occasionally as long as eight days. Although the distribution of the rubella rash is similar to that of rubeola, the spread is much more rapid, and the rash does not darken or coalesce. Mild nonexudative conjunctivitis and an enanthem on the soft palate (Forchheimer spots) also may be observed, and occasionally acute thyroiditis develops.</p><p>Primary infection among teenagers and adults tends to be of longer duration than that among young children. Patients are more frequently symptomatic, and symptoms are more frequently accompanied by a prodrome of fever and systemic complaints. The exanthem in adults is similar to that in children, as described above. Arthralgias and arthritis occur among as many as 70 percent of teenagers and adult women. Therefore, these findings are not considered complications, but rather part of the case definition in these groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among children and adult males, joint manifestations are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Arthritis and arthralgias usually occur concurrently with the rash and may persist for a month or more. The knees, wrists, and fingers are most frequently involved. Although cases of chronic arthritis with rubella have been reported occasionally, the role of rubella virus in causing chronic forms of arthritis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a>). Additional findings may include conjunctivitis, testalgia, and orchitis.</p><p>Complications of rubella are infrequent; they are observed more frequently among teenagers and adults than children. Postinfectious encephalitis occurs in about 1 per 6000 rubella cases, usually within a week of the exanthem, but may occur without any rash. The encephalitis may be immune-mediated. In general the prognosis is good, although fatal cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. Progressive rubella panencephalitis is a rare and devastating complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Hemorrhagic complications are estimated to occur in approximately 1 per 3000 cases and more frequently among children than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital rubella syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent defect associated with congenital rubella syndrome is hearing loss, followed by mental retardation, cardiovascular defects, and ocular defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-rubella-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital rubella syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-rubella-syndrome-management-outcome-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital rubella syndrome: Management, outcome, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of rubella includes infectious and noninfectious causes such as skin diseases and drug reactions. Infections that should be considered include scarlet fever and parvovirus infections since these are common infections with similar rashes. Parvovirus infection in adults also is similarly associated with arthritis and arthralgia. Roseola (human herpesviruses 6 and 7), rash-associated enteroviral infections, infectious mononucleosis, mild and vaccine-associated measles, and toxoplasmosis also may have similar rashes.</p><p>Routine nonspecific laboratory tests are not specific or helpful in differentiating rubella from other diseases. Specific laboratory diagnosis is appropriate when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital rubella syndrome is suspected</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is sought for a condition compatible with known complications of rubella, such as arthritis, hemorrhagic purpura, and central nervous system disease</p><p/><p>Rubella infection is most commonly diagnosed by detection of rubella-specific IgM antibodies using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with commercially available kits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/15,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32</a>]. The EIA capture assay provides greater specificity than the indirect EIA, which may give false positive results in the presence of rheumatoid factor and some viral infections such as parvovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus.</p><p>Specific IgM antibody can be detected as early as four days after the onset of rash and is usually detectable after primary infection for six to eight weeks or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The positive predictive value of rubella IgM detection is particularly low in populations with high immunization rates and low prevalence of rubella virus. Rubella infection and reinfection can be demonstrated by a fourfold rise in rubella IgG antibody concentrations between acute and convalescent sera. Recent infection may also be detected by measurement of low avidity IgG rubella antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/15,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,34</a>].</p><p>Viral isolation from nasopharyngeal secretions can be used to confirm acute rubella infection during pregnancy. Congenital infection may be confirmed by viral isolation from the cord blood or placenta, as well as from nasopharyngeal secretions and urine of the newborn. Viral isolation, however, is rarely used or available because of its technical difficulty and expense. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays have been used to diagnose in utero rubella infection by detection of rubella RNA in amniotic fluid and other products of conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/12,15,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,35</a>].

Immunization of all young children is required to reduce rates of congenital rubella syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/13,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31</a>]. Available rubella vaccines are based on the <span class=\"nowrap\">RA/23</span> strain grown in human diploid cell cultures. At least one dose of live attenuated rubella-containing vaccine is recommended for all individuals 12 months of age or older; one dose of rubella vaccine produces a seroconversion rate of about 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rubella/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In many locations, including the United States, the rubella vaccine is only available as part of the combined measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR) and the MMR combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> (MMRV).

The rash is usually an erythematous, discrete maculopapular exanthem that begins on the face and spreads caudally. It usually disappears within three days but may persist for eight days. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rubella is acquired through the inhalation of large particle aerosols of infectious secretions with initial infection of nasopharyngeal cells and subsequent viremia and spread to other body sites. The incubation period is usually 14 to 18 days with a range of 12 to 23 days. Virus may be shed for up to one to two weeks prior to the appearance of the rash. Patients may be contagious one to two weeks before the infection becomes clinically apparent. Subclinical or asymptomatic infection is common.
