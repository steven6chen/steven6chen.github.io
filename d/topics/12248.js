The increasing rates of survival among the smallest of premature infants due to changes in antenatal and postnatal respiratory management, such as antenatal steroids and surfactant replacement, contribute to an overall increase in the incidence of BPD despite advances in the care of premature infants that reduce the risk or severity of BPD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The outcome of infants with BPD is reviewed here.

Data on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is often based upon the following classification of preterm infants, categorized by birth weight as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low birth weight (LBW) - BW less than 2500 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very low birth weight (VLBW) - BW less than 1500 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) - BW less than 1000 g</p><p/><p>These terms are used throughout this discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRENDS OVER TIME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathology and clinical course of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been altered by the widespread use of surfactant after its introduction in 1980, and the increased survival rate of extremely low birth weight infants. As a result, the long-term outcome of BPD continues to change along with these factors. In particular, results vary depending upon whether the study was performed prior to or after the introduction of surfactant in the 1980s. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the definition of BPD has also evolved over time. Studies that were performed prior to the 2001 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) modified consensus definition may have used definitions that are less accurate at predicting outcome, because of the increasing survival rate of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and the increased prevalence of milder forms of BPD due to improved treatment of RDS.

After adjusting for confounding factors, no significant differences were detected in growth at school age in children who had BPD compared with those who did not have BPD.
