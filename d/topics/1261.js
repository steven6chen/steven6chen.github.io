Outbreaks of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) have also been reported, mainly in populations of men who have sex with men. Other sexually transmitted pathogens causing genital ulcers are less common in the United States but may be more prevalent in other parts of the world. The presence of genital ulcers is a risk factor for the transmission of HIV.</p><p>The challenge for the clinician is to determine the cause of the genital ulcer in order to institute appropriate therapy and to decrease the risk of transmission to others. However, determining the etiology can be complicated due to limitations of current diagnostic testing modalities and the fact that more than one infection may coexist. </p><p>The approach to the patient with genital ulcers is discussed below.

Painful ulcers tend to be more typical of HSV and chancroid, while ulcers associated with syphilis, LGV, and granuloma inguinale are usually painless. However, a diagnosis made solely on the presence or absence of pain may be misleading and, in the absence of obvious vesicles that strongly suggest genital herpes, is unreliable for making an etiologic diagnosis.

During the initial evaluation, we typically test for HSV and syphilis, even if the patient does not endorse being at risk, since patients may not be aware of their exposure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may not feel comfortable disclosing sensitive information. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) &ndash; </strong>During the workup of a patient with new genital ulcers, we obtain testing for herpes simplex. However, repeat HSV testing is generally not necessary in a patient with prior laboratory-confirmed genital HSV and with clinical manifestations consistent with recurrent disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To test for HSV, the lesion should be swabbed and directly tested for HSV. Nucleic acid amplification methods (NAATs), including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, are now commercially available and are the test of choice, as they have a higher sensitivity than culture or direct immunofluorescent antibody testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers/abstract/24,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If HSV PCR is not available, a viral culture of the base of the ulcer can be obtained. If a vesicle is present, vesicular fluid is preferred because of its higher diagnostic yield. Direct fluorescent antibody testing performed on a scraping of the base of an ulcer can also be performed in lieu of viral culture. Cytologic detection of cellular changes associated with HSV infection (ie, Tzanck preparation) is an insensitive and nonspecific method of detection and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In addition, tests for HSV-1 cannot distinguish between oral and genital infections. However, obtaining HSV serologies may be considered in select clinical scenarios. As an example, if no active lesions are present, the presence of HSV-2 serum antibodies in someone with recurrent genital ulcers is highly suggestive of the diagnosis.

Some of the assays have low sensitivity (eg, viral culture for herpes simplex virus [HSV], syphilis IgG during primary syphilis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. More sensitive assays, such as real-time HSV polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are more costly to perform and are often unavailable in emergency rooms, sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, and resource-limited settings, though this may change in the future. </p><p>Empiric treatment decisions are based primarily upon the clinical evaluation and sexual history. Knowledge of the local epidemiology of the agents that cause genital ulcers in a given geographic area can also be instructive, particularly in the setting of an outbreak. Public health departments can often provide helpful information since syphilis, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) are reportable infections in most jurisdictions.

If surveillance data are inaccurate, certain infections can be under-recognized and undertreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. However, even with a thorough evaluation, up to 25 percent of patients who have genital ulcers have no laboratory-confirmed diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Accurate diagnoses are also important from a public health standpoint, since treatment of sexual contacts of patients with syphilis, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum is important in curbing the spread of these infections. Diagnosis and treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) decreases viral shedding and, subsequently, the risk of HSV transmission. However, treatment of HSV has not been shown to decrease the risk of HIV transmission from patients who are coinfected with both HSV and HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers/abstract/24,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,38</a>]. </p><p>It is important that patients have a confidential, easily accessible setting where they can go for screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Many STI clinics offer services for no fee as part of their mission to diagnose and control the spread of infection. Introduction of even a modest clinic fee of USD $15 for Denver residents during a budget shortfall led to 3250 fewer STI clinic visits in 2003 (a decline of 29 percent) compared with the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1174691229\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

There are five sexually transmitted pathogens that can cause genital ulcer disease (GUD): herpes simplex virus types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2); <em>Treponema pallidum </em>(the causative agent of syphilis); <em>Haemophilus ducreyi </em>(the causative agent of chancroid); <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> serovars L1-3 (the causative agents of lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV]); and <em>Klebsiella granulomatis</em> (the causative agent of granuloma inguinale, also known as &quot;donovanosis&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H149995\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with genital ulcers should assess for the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81735 \">table 1</a>); such infections can be transmitted to others and can increase the risk of acquiring HIV. For patients who have a negative evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> do not respond to empiric therapy, further evaluation for less common sexually transmitted causes of GUD and non-sexually acquired causes of GUD may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H406530882\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When obtaining a history from patients with genital ulcers, it is important to assess their sexual risk behaviors and where they (or their sexual contacts) reside, as well as pertinent clinical signs and symptoms (eg, if the lesions are painful, the presence of constitutional symptoms). (See <a href=\"#H406530889\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On physical examination, the number of lesions, their appearance, and the presence of adenopathy may suggest one diagnosis over another. However, the clinician may be mistaken if the diagnosis is made solely on this basis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2010166564\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of a clinical diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with genital ulcers should have a diagnostic evaluation for HSV and syphilis, regardless of their symptoms. They should also be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, since patients with an ulcerative STI are at increased risk for coinfection with other STIs. Additional testing for chancroid, LGV, or granuloma inguinale will depend upon the patient's risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians are often faced with lack of diagnostic test results at the initial patient encounter and concerns regarding patient follow-up. We initiate empiric therapy for the following patients with genital ulcers, rather than waiting for diagnostic test results: patients with a known exposure to an STI; patients with genital ulcers suggestive of HSV; and patients with an ulcer suggestive of syphilis (eg, painless ulcer) if they are at high risk for syphilis or may not follow up. (See <a href=\"#H46\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate empiric treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1314147614\" class=\"local\">'Treatment regimens'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A follow-up evaluation is essential for patients to review the results of initial testing and be certain a clinical response has been obtained if empiric therapy was initiated. If the patient continues to have ulcerative lesions or constitutional symptoms develop, more testing may be required. (See <a href=\"#H55\" class=\"local\">'Patient counseling and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual contacts of patients who are diagnosed with an STI should be notified, screened, and treated, depending on the pathogen and the timing of the exposure. Partner notification for reportable infections, such as syphilis, is usually accomplished through the local public health department.
