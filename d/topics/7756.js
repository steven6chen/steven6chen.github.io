This parasite, which also goes by the names <em>Giardia duodenalis</em> or <em>Giardia intestinalis</em>, resides in the gut and can cause diarrhea and stomach discomfort (nausea, stomachache). It is one of the most common gastrointestinal parasites; an estimated 1.2 million cases occur annually in the United States.</p><p><em>Giardia</em> can affect people of all ages, but it is especially common in children younger than five years old. It is also seen in internationally adopted children and among people who travel in resource-limited settings.</p><p>The <em>Giardia</em> organism is found in the feces of infected people and can spread because of poor sanitation or because drinking water or food becomes contaminated. It can also infect animals, such as dogs, cattle, and sheep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">How Giardia is spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Giardia</em> infections can spread in three ways, all of which can be prevented. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248645279\"><span class=\"h3\">Waterborne transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Waterborne transmission is the most common route of infection. People who drink from contaminated streams, reservoirs, or wells can become infected. Contaminated water used to prepare drinks or wash raw food can also be a source of infection.</p><p>Waterborne transmission is especially likely among campers and hikers who drink from untreated water sources (streams, lakes) and among people traveling in regions where water sanitation standards may not be adequate to eliminate the organism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248645305\"><span class=\"h3\">Foodborne transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organism that causes <em>Giardia</em> is killed by cooking, so properly cooked food rarely leads to infection. However, uncooked food or food that is contaminated after cooking can cause <em>Giardia </em>infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Person-to-person transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Person-to-person transmission can happen when traces of infected feces travel between two people. This can happen if someone does not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom or after changing the diapers of an infected child. Person-to-person transmission is the cause of outbreaks in families and institutions, such as daycare centers and nursing homes. Person-to-person transmission can also happen during anal sex or during sex play involving the anus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GIARDIA SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Giardia</em> infections do not always cause symptoms. Some people carry the organism without ever knowing it. Some people develop symptoms and then get better without treatment because they combat the infection on their own. When symptoms do arise, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that comes on suddenly and may be initially watery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malaise (a vague feeling of discomfort) or fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foul-smelling and fatty stools</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal cramps, gas, and bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>People generally develop these symptoms one to two weeks after being exposed to <em>Giardia</em>, and the symptoms often last at least two to four weeks. Some people develop a chronic form of <em>Giardia</em> that lasts even longer, although symptoms tend to be less severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giardia can also interfere with the way the body absorbs nutrients, so it can cause vitamin deficiencies and other nutritional problems. In up to 40 percent of cases, <em>Giardia</em> impairs the body's ability to digest lactose, the form of sugar found in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Guidance about lactose products is included below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence of symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GIARDIA DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your healthcare provider thinks you may have <em>Giardia</em>, he or she will ask you for a stool sample and then send it to the lab. There, technicians will examine the stool to test for any parasites that might be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>You may need to provide more than one stool sample before the infection shows up on a test. Depending on your individual situation, your doctor might also recommend additional tests, such as endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">GIARDIA TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for <em>Giardia</em> involves taking an antibiotic for at least one day or several days. In most cases, that is enough to eliminate the infection and its symptoms. In stubborn cases that do not improve with the first round of antibiotics, doctors sometimes recommend changing the type, dose, or duration of treatment.</p><p>If you do not have symptoms of <em>Giardia</em> but testing shows that you are infected, you may not need antibiotic treatment. However, children in daycare and people who handle food should be treated for <em>Giardia</em> even if they have no symptoms to prevent the spread of infection.</p><p>Avoid swimming in pools, hot tubs, lakes, rivers, and the ocean until one week after you have finished treatment for <em>Giardia</em>. Do not go swimming if you still have diarrhea. Swimming can contaminate the water and cause others to become ill. Avoid all types of anal sex until treatment has been completed.</p><p>If your symptoms resolve after you finish your antibiotic treatment, you do not need to be tested for <em>Giardia</em> again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations for children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are the most important part of <em>Giardia</em> treatment both in children and adults, but children sometimes need additional care. Diarrhea can cause dehydration and a salt imbalance, both of which can be especially tough on children. For them, drinks containing electrolytes may be recommended to restore what is lost through diarrhea. Fluid and electrolyte replacement are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The safety of breastfeeding while being treated for <em>Giardia</em> depends upon which antibiotic is used; some antibiotics are safe to take while breastfeeding while others are not. If you are breastfeeding, ask your healthcare provider if you can safely breastfeed while taking your antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-health-and-nutrition-during-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics#H14\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Maternal health and nutrition during breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Medication safety with breastfeeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After being treated for <em>Giardia</em> and seeing symptoms improve, some people experience a relapse. This can happen because people consume dairy products too soon or because they are still infected with <em>Giardia</em>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Giardia</em> can interfere with the body's ability to digest dairy products (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional problems'</a> above). Even once the infection is gone, it can take several weeks before normal digestion returns. For this reason, patients may wish to avoid milk, cheese, yogurt, and any other foods that contain lactose for at least a month following treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55938 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you or your child develop symptoms again after being treated for <em>Giardia</em>, your healthcare provider will want to run another stool test to determine if <em>Giardia</em> is causing the problem. If <em>Giardia</em> shows up again, it could be that the first round of treatment did not get all the organisms or it could be that you or your child were reinfected somehow. Work with your healthcare provider to root out the possible source of the infection and ask about how you can prevent future infections.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">GIARDIA PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key to preventing <em>Giardia</em> and other infections is good hygiene. Here are some good hygiene tips:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands with soap and water before eating and after using the bathroom, and teach children to do the same.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands with soap and water after changing diapers or after tending to anyone who has poor bowel control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dispose of diapers properly and wash any clothes that could be contaminated with even small amounts of feces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to swallow water when swimming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-treat drinking water when traveling or hiking. This can be done by:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Boiling drinking water for at least 10 minutes at a hard boil.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adding five drops of tincture of iodine to a quart of water and waiting 30 minutes. Iodine is much more effective in eliminating <em>Giardia</em> than chlorine-based (bleach) treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Using a high-quality water filtration system. Information about water purification and a traveler's guide for buying water filters is available at the <a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel&amp;token=l4XEPiERdo6YCULKBVgx+mD6OVLmMziiEPYoq0GONq2cOoy/3kkQG7bY8Elaf620&amp;TOPIC_ID=3995\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use proper food preparation etiquette.
