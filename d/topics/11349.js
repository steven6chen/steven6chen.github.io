Devastating rhino-orbital-cerebral and pulmonary infections are the most common syndromes caused by these fungi.</p><p>There is some controversy over the terminology used to refer to infections due to this group of fungi. The term &quot;mucormycosis&quot; was used for years and then was supplanted by &quot;zygomycosis&quot; for several decades. Based on molecular studies, &quot;mucormycosis&quot; is currently again the appropriate term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The microbiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and therapy of mucormycosis will be reviewed here. Several specific syndromes that can be caused by these fungi are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal rhinosinusitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-access-related-infections-in-chronic-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-access-related infections in chronic dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genera in the order Mucorales cause most human infection. These organisms are ubiquitous in nature and can be found on decaying vegetation and in the soil. These fungi grow rapidly and release large numbers of spores that can become airborne. Because the agents of mucormycosis are common in the environment, they are relatively frequent contaminants in the clinical microbiology laboratory; all humans have ample exposure to these fungi during day-to-day activities. The fact that mucormycosis is a rare human infection reflects the effectiveness of the intact human immune system. This is further supported by the finding that almost all human infections due to the agents of mucormycosis occur in the presence of some underlying compromising condition.</p><p>The genera most commonly found in human infections are <em>Rhizopus</em>, <em>Mucor</em>, and <em>Rhizomucor</em>; <em>Cunninghamella</em>, <em>Absidia</em>, <em>Saksenaea</em>, and <em>Apophysomyces </em>are genera that are less commonly implicated in infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The hyphae of the Mucorales are distinct and allow for a presumptive identification from clinical specimens. The hyphae are broad (5 to 15 micron diameter), irregularly branched, and have rare septations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66476\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66476 \">picture 1</a>). This is in contrast to the hyphae of ascomycetous molds, such as <em>Aspergillus</em>, which are narrower (2 to 5 micron diameter), exhibit regular branching, and have many septations.</p><p>The lack of regular septations may contribute to the fragile nature of the hyphae and the difficulty of growing the agents of mucormycosis from clinical specimens. Grinding clinical specimens can cause excessive damage to the hyphae. Thus, finely mincing tissues is preferred for culturing tissue samples that may contain molds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Rhizopus</em> organisms have an enzyme, ketone reductase, which allows them to thrive in high glucose, acidic conditions. Serum from healthy individuals inhibits growth of <em>Rhizopus</em>, whereas serum from individuals in diabetic ketoacidosis stimulates growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Rhino-orbital-cerebral and pulmonary mucormycosis are acquired by the inhalation of spores. In healthy individuals, cilia transport these spores to the pharynx and they are cleared through the gastrointestinal tract. In susceptible individuals, infection usually begins in the nasal turbinates or the alveoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The agents of mucormycosis are angioinvasive; thus, infarction of infected tissues is a hallmark of invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Deferoxamine and iron overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Deferoxamine</a>, which chelates both iron and aluminum, increases the risk of mucormycosis by enhancing growth and pathogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-11</a>]. The deferoxamine-iron chelate, called feroxamine, is a siderophore for the species <em>Rhizopus</em>, increasing iron uptake by the fungus, which stimulates fungal growth and leads to tissue invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>].</p><p>Iron overload itself may predispose to mucormycosis in the absence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, individuals with diabetic ketoacidosis have elevated concentrations of free iron in their serum, which supports the growth of <em>Rhizopus oryzae</em> at an acidic, but not at an alkaline, pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Deferoxamine</a> was once used commonly as an aluminum chelator in patients with renal failure; however, aluminum excess is rarely seen today. Currently, patients at risk for deferoxamine-associated mucormycosis are those who have received multiple blood transfusions and are treated with this chelating agent for iron overload. The majority of patients with deferoxamine-associated infection present with disseminated disease that is rapidly fatal, with a mortality rate that approaches 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aluminum toxicity in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects of deferoxamine'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a>, other iron chelating agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferasirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferasirox</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferiprone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferiprone</a>, do not act as siderophores and therefore do not increase the risk of mucormycosis. To the contrary, studies in mice with mucormycosis found that these agents might actually be beneficial (eg, improve survival and reduce the tissue fungal burden) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

A review of 929 cases of mucormycosis that were reported between 1940 and 2003 noted that diabetes mellitus was the most common risk factor, found in 36 percent of cases, followed by hematologic malignancies (17 percent) and solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In some patients, mucormycosis was the diabetes-defining illness. In a later study of 101 patients diagnosed with mucormycosis between 2005 and 2007 in France, hematologic malignancy was the most common risk factor, occurring in 50 percent of patients, followed by diabetes in 23 percent and trauma in 18 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368730437\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy and hematopoietic cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with malignancy, hematologic malignancies are much more frequently associated with mucormycosis than solid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/5,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25-27</a>]. However, even in patients with hematologic malignancies, mucormycosis appears to occur in less than 1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, the reported incidence has ranged from 0.1 to 2 percent, with the highest incidence in patients with graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Reports from several countries have noted an increase in mucormycosis in patients with hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/1,31,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31,40</a>].

However, culture often yields no growth, and histopathologic identification of an organism with a structure typical of Mucorales may provide the only evidence of infection. A clinician must think of this entity in the appropriate clinical setting and pursue invasive testing in order to establish a diagnosis as early as possible. On the other hand, the agents of mucormycosis can colonize the airways or be contaminants in cultures, and the isolation of these fungi in a culture does not necessarily prove infection. Interpreting the culture results in the context of the patient's signs and symptoms and underlying disease are necessary to determine whether antifungal therapy should be given.</p><p>Serum tests, such as the 1,3-beta-D-glucan assay and the <em>Aspergillus </em>galactomannan assay, are being used with increased frequency in patients suspected of having an invasive fungal infection. The agents of mucormycosis do <strong>not</strong> share these cell wall components and neither test is positive in patients with mucormycosis.

In a retrospective study that included 189 patients with proven or probable fungal pneumonia, the reversed halo sign was seen in 7 of 37 patients with mucormycosis (19 percent), 1 of 132 patients with invasive aspergillosis (&lt;1 percent), and none of 20 patients with fusariosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

In a matched case-control analysis that compared patients who received isavuconazole for primary therapy of mucormycosis with contemporary controls who received amphotericin B (the majority received a lipid formulation), day 42 crude all-cause mortality was similar in those who received isavuconazole (7 of 21 patients; 33 percent) versus amphotericin B followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> (13 of 33 patients; 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucormycosis-zygomycosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].

Devastating rhino-orbital-cerebral and pulmonary infections are the major syndromes caused by these fungi. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organisms in the order Mucorales are ubiquitous in nature and can be found on decaying vegetation and in the soil. The genera most commonly found in human infections are <em>Rhizopus</em>, <em>Mucor</em>, and <em>Rhizomucor</em>; <em>Cunninghamella</em>, <em>Saksenaea</em>, and <em>Apophysomyces </em>are less commonly implicated in infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mycology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Deferoxamine</a>, which chelates both iron and aluminum, increases the risk of mucormycosis by enhancing growth and pathogenicity. The deferoxamine-iron chelate, called feroxamine, is a siderophore for the species <em>Rhizopus</em>, increasing iron uptake by the fungus, which stimulates fungal growth and leads to tissue invasion. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Deferoxamine and iron overload'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucormycosis is characterized by infarction and necrosis of host tissues that results from invasion of the vasculature by hyphae. The most common clinical presentation of mucormycosis is rhino-orbital-cerebral infection, which is presumed to start with inhalation of spores into the paranasal sinuses of a susceptible host. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary mucormycosis is a rapidly progressive infection that occurs after inhalation of spores into the bronchioles and alveoli. Pneumonia with infarction and necrosis results, and the infection can spread to contiguous structures, such as the mediastinum and heart, or disseminate hematogenously to other organs. Mucormycosis can also cause gastrointestinal, cutaneous, renal, and disseminated disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary mucormycosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of mucormycosis relies upon the identification of organisms in tissue by histopathology with culture confirmation. However, culture often yields no growth, and histopathologic identification of an organism with a structure typical of Mucorales may provide the only evidence of infection. A clinician must think of this entity in the appropriate clinical setting and pursue invasive testing in order to establish a diagnosis as early as possible. The polymerase chain reaction with sequencing may be useful for identifying the causative species when histopathology is positive but cultures are negative. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of mucormycosis involves a combination of surgical debridement of involved tissues and antifungal therapy. Aggressive surgical debridement of involved tissues should be undertaken as soon as the diagnosis of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is suspected. Elimination of predisposing factors for infection, such as hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> administration, and neutropenia, is also critical. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The drug of choice for initial therapy of mucormycosis is a lipid formulation of amphotericin B.

When switching to oral posaconazole, we favor the use of posaconazole delayed-release tablets (300 mg every 12 hours on the first day, then 300 mg once daily) taken with food. We do <strong>not</strong> use the oral suspension of posaconazole since it is not highly bioavailable and requires fatty food for absorption. Loading doses of 200 mg (ie, two capsules) of oral isavuconazole (equivalent to 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate) should be given every 8 hours for six doses, followed by 200 mg orally once daily starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose.
