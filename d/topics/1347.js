The angle of entry for successful arterial puncture may be closer to 30 degrees rather than 45 degrees, especially in infants and young children. Too steep of a needle angle risks missing the flash of blood from the smaller artery in these patients.

The radial artery is palpable between the distal radius and the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis and usually can be more easily accessed with the wrist extended. The modified Allen test should be used to demonstrate collateral flow through the superficial palmar arch prior to cannulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70306 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79685 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Alternate arterial sites include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior tibial</strong> &ndash; The posterior tibial artery<strong> </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66126 \">figure 3</a>) is palpable just posterior to the medial malleolus and is preferred to the femoral site in neonates and young infants. Cannulation of the artery may be facilitated by holding the foot in comfortable dorsiflexion with eversion of the ankle. The most accessible area is a point between the medial malleolus and the calcaneus tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78072\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78072 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dorsalis pedis &ndash; </strong>The dorsalis pedis artery<strong> </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74882\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74882 \">figure 4</a>)<strong> </strong>is located lateral to the extensor hallucis longus tendon and has collateral flow from the lateral plantar artery through an arch system similar to that in the hand. It is preferable to the femoral site in neonates and young infants. Collateral flow should be checked by occluding the dorsalis pedis artery, compressing the nail bed of the great toe, and confirming a rapid return of color when pressure on the toe is released.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Femoral </strong>&ndash; The femoral artery site is located midway between the symphysis pubis and superior iliac spine and approximately 2 cm below the inguinal ligament<strong> </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57455\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57455 \">figure 5</a>). This site is used when peripheral arterial access on the wrist or foot is not achievable. The patient&rsquo;s hip should be flexed and externally rotated and a towel roll placed to improve the approach to the femoral artery prior to the procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57455\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57455 \">figure 5</a>). The femoral artery can be palpated just below the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. The needle should be inserted just below the inguinal ligament, at a 90 degree angle toward the pulsation. Arterial catheterization via the femoral route may lead to thrombosis and distal embolization to the foot and must be accompanied by close monitoring of distal pulses. (See <a href=\"#H1861506\" class=\"local\">'Arterial obstruction (vasospasm)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1861546\" class=\"local\">'Arterial thrombosis and embolism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brachial </strong>&ndash; The brachial artery can be accessed at the point of maximal pulsation just above the antecubital fossa on the medial aspect of the arm. The author&rsquo;s approach is to avoid this site for arterial cannulation because of limited collateral flow to the distal arm, especially in neonates and young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, if absolutely necessary, this site can be used. As an example, no serious complications or permanent damage was reported in a large perioperative series of neonates and young children undergoing surgery for congenital heart defects, and complications were not more frequent than in children undergoing radial artery cannulation despite duration of insertion of several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of note, these patients needed assessment of preductal arterial oxygenation. Thus, cannulation of an artery in the right upper extremity was essential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Axillary </strong>&ndash; The axillary artery is a continuation of the subclavian artery and is palpable medial to the pectoralis muscle high up in the axilla when the arm is abducted to 90 degrees and the dorsum of the hand flat on the stretcher near the ipsilateral ear or placed under the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This site may be used in older children with poor perfusion when cannulation of other sites is unsuccessful. It is typically avoided in neonates and young infants. Good collateral flow to the arm occurs through the thyrocervical trunk and subscapular artery. Thus, the risk of ischemic complications to the arm is low. The clinician should ensure puncture at the point of maximal impulse to reduce the risk of inadvertently damaging the terminal branch nerves of the brachial plexus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69782\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69782 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p/><p>The following equipment should be assembled prior to the procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiseptic solution (eg, povidone-iodine solution) and sterile gauze, or prepackaged antiseptic wipes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile gloves, eye protection, and surgical mask.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile drapes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravascular catheter or prepackaged arterial cannulation kit &ndash; The catheter size for puncture is selected based upon the child's weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74881 \">table 1</a>).

Use of ultrasound guidance for arterial cannulation may decrease the number of attempts and increase success. Either B-mode or color duplex imaging can be used to identify the vessel, although visualization of needle placement is better with B-mode imaging due to less artifact. An echogenic needle system also improves visualization under ultrasound guidance.</p><p>In two meta-analyses of ultrasound-guided radial artery catheterization, first attempt success was significantly higher and risk of hematoma formation or ischemia was lower when ultrasound was used when compare to palpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The benefit of ultrasound-guided arterial cannulation may be more pronounced especially in infants and young children and when performed by an experienced practitioner. </p><p>However, ultrasound guidance also appears useful to aid arterial cannulation by trainees. As an example, in one prospective observational study of 45 trainees, not included in the above meta-analyses, use of ultrasound guidance instead of a landmark method was also associated with significantly shorter procedure time (average time 8 versus 17 minutes, respectively) and number of attempts (average number 3 versus 7, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In addition, we advocate changing to a guidewire approach if difficulties are encountered with the direct puncture approach. In an unblinded trial of 100 children undergoing radial artery cannulation, use of a guidewire was associated with significantly fewer cannulation attempts, shorter procedure time, a higher rate of success, and more frequent ability to perform satisfactory blood pressure monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The technique for placement of an arterial cannula using a separate or integral guidewire is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure that the selected site has <strong>no</strong> signs of infection and, if applicable, adequate collateral circulation (radial and dorsalis pedis sites).

The risk of infection is increased with younger age and increased duration of cannulation.</p><p>Meticulous attention to sterile technique during arterial cannulation and when drawing blood from the arterial line is important for reducing infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Limiting the duration of arterial cannulation as a means to reduce infection risk is also appropriate, especially in high risk patients (eg, immunocompromised patients). However, the risk of infection from an indwelling arterial catheter is low, and routine removal and replacement is not indicated if the patient&rsquo;s clinical condition requires ongoing intraarterial access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1861546\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial thrombosis and embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with signs of compromised distal circulation (eg, decreased or absent pulse, blanched or mottled skin, delayed capillary refill, cold distal extremity) and evidence of arterial thrombosis or embolism on imaging (eg, Doppler ultrasound, angiography, magnetic resonance imaging), arterial catheter removal and prompt consultation with a vascular surgeon is imperative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Arterial thrombosis is described in up to 23 percent of children with indwelling arterial catheters and occurs more frequently in younger patients and those cannulated with larger catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/2,3,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,19-21</a>].

By contrast, the risk of ischemic complications of thrombosis after femoral artery cannulation in children is approximately 13 percent although this higher risk is in part due to the need to use the femoral artery instead of the radial artery in children with poor perfusion and thus, a higher risk for thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Embolization of thrombi from smaller arteries (radial, dorsalis pedis) may cause digital emboli with distal discoloration, skin necrosis, and, rarely, amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Emboli from larger vessels (femoral, brachial, axillary) may also produce distal limb ischemia and lead to amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Pulses distal to these sites should be monitored regularly.

Gas diffusion through plastic syringes may introduce errors in blood gas analysis. However, studies vary regarding the magnitude of error. As a general rule, the error is not significant if the sample is analyzed within 15 minutes. Placement of the specimen on ice also reduces this error.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Air bubbles</strong> &ndash; Air bubbles that occupy more than 1 to 2 percent of the blood volume in the syringe may introduce error, leading to an artificially high arterial PO2 and an underestimation of the true arterial pCO<sub>2</sub>. The error can be decreased by gentle removal of bubbles without agitation and by rapid sample analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heparin use</strong> &ndash; Heparin is added to the syringe as an anticoagulant. The change in pH that results from the addition of acidic heparin is small. However, the dilutional effect of the heparin solution can produce significant reductions in the pCO<sub>2</sub>, depending directly upon the amount of heparin solution relative to the amount of blood. Thus, the amount of heparin solution should be kept to a minimum, and no less than 2 mL of blood should be obtained.</p><p/><p>The blood gas sample should be placed on ice during transport, primarily to reduce oxygen consumption by leukocyte metabolism. Oxygen consumption is most pronounced in patients with profound leukocytosis. Rapid cooling of specimens obtained from these patients is necessary to avoid factitious hypoxemia. This error also can be reduced by rapid specimen analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-blood-gases#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial blood gases&quot;, section on 'Transport and analysis'</a>.)</p><p>Analysis of arterial blood samples usually is performed using automated blood gas analyzers. Rigorous quality control with standardized testing materials is essential to assure the accuracy of results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-blood-gases#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial blood gases&quot;, section on 'Transport and analysis'</a>.)</p><p>Arterial blood gas analyzers operate at 37&ordm;C, which may differ from the body temperature of the patient from whom the blood sample was taken. Although the total content of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood do not change, the pH, pCO<sub>2</sub>, and PO2 of a blood sample all vary with temperature in a predictable way because gas tensions and hydrogen ion concentration decline with temperature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59630 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-blood-gases#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial blood gases&quot;, section on 'Transport and analysis'</a>.)</p><p>Modern automated blood gas analyzers are capable of reporting values at either 37&ordm;C (the temperature at which the values are measured by the machine) or at the patient's temperature. Whether values of pH, pCO<sub>2</sub>, and PO<sub>2</sub> should be &quot;corrected&quot; to the patient's actual body temperature remains controversial, and &quot;corrected&quot; blood gas values should be interpreted with this in mind. Because of this uncertainty, most clinicians recommend using uncorrected values to guide therapy, recognizing that these results correspond to the arterial blood gas values that would have been present if the patient's temperature were 37&ordm;C.

In non-shock states, this increase results from the alteration in pulse contour as the pressure wave moves peripherally. The ascending portion of the wave becomes steeper, and the systolic reading becomes higher. However, the diastolic measurement usually is lower, leading to an unchanged mean arterial pressure. In shock states with a high systemic vascular resistance, the generated Korotkoff sounds may be inaudible by conventional sphygmomanometry, leading to erroneously low measurements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD GAS MONITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous intraarterial blood gas monitors have been used successfully in infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Such monitors use fiberoptic and fluorescent dye technology for determination of PO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>, and pH through either an indwelling, continuous monitoring catheter or an external, intermittent sensor supplied with arterial blood through a tubing loop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Although reliable blood gas measurements can be obtained, the size of the monitors and the associated dampening of blood pressure waveforms frequently encountered at the radial arterial site typically limit their use to femoral artery catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H904231\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, arterial puncture is frequently performed to assess acid-base status and oxygenation, to correlate arterial with less invasive measurements (eg, venous blood gas or pulse oximetry), or to obtain a blood sample when venipuncture is unsuccessful.
