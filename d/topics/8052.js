It is usually caused by microorganisms (predominantly bacteria) that enter the bone hematogenously. Other pathogenic mechanisms include direct inoculation (usually traumatic, but also surgical), or local invasion from a contiguous infection (eg, decubitus ulcer, sinusitis, periodontal disease). Risk factors for nonhematogenous osteomyelitis include open fractures that require surgical reduction, implanted orthopedic hardware (such as pins or screws), and puncture wounds.</p><p/><p>The clinical features and complications of hematogenous osteomyelitis in children will be discussed here.

Approximately one-half of cases are associated with antecedent infections, which often are healthcare-associated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of osteomyelitis in young infants may be mild and nonspecific. Many infants are afebrile and continue to feed well, although they may have vomiting and irritability. Systemic symptoms may be more pronounced with <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> osteomyelitis than with osteomyelitis caused by other pathogens. <em>S. aureus</em> osteomyelitis also may be associated with multifocal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Common initial signs include decreased movement, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythema of the affected area. As the infection progresses, the epiphysis and adjacent joint may become involved. Soft tissue surrounding the infected bone may become swollen and discolored as purulence ruptures through the thin bony cortex into the contiguous muscle bed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology&quot;, section on 'Birth to three months'</a>.)</p><p>In a series of 30 infants (&lt;4 months) with confirmed osteomyelitis, only 10 were febrile; five had no focal findings and were evaluated for osteomyelitis because of positive blood culture or suspected sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Concomitant septic arthritis occurred in 14 (42 percent), and multifocal infection in 12 (40 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Older infants and toddlers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial symptoms of hematogenous osteomyelitis in older infants and young children frequently are nonspecific and mild. Verbal children may complain of localized pain. A history of nonspecific trauma may precede the onset of symptoms; diagnosis may be delayed if musculoskeletal complaints are initially attributed to trauma.</p><p>As the infection progresses, the child may refuse to use the affected extremity. Ambulatory young children with osteomyelitis of the lower extremity, pelvis, or spine may develop a progressive limp, or refuse to sit, walk, or bear weight. Nonambulatory young children may refuse to sit or crawl or become irritable when picked up or appear to be in pain or uncomfortable with diaper changing.</p><p>On examination, pain is typically well-localized, with point tenderness over the infected bone; there may be contiguous edema. Pain is referred to the involved area when other parts of the long bone are percussed. In older infants and young children with vertebral osteomyelitis, there may be percussion tenderness over the contiguous spine, hip pain and stiffness, or loss of lumbar lordosis. However, it may be difficult to elicit these findings. Pelvic osteomyelitis may be localized to the buttock. In children with discitis, compression of the spine occasionally produces pain at the infected disc.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Older children and adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In late childhood and adolescence, patients are more likely than younger children to complain of localized pain. Injury, rather than infection may be suspected initially, particularly if the child is without fever and systemic symptoms, and may delay the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.</p><p>On physical examination, the infectious process is more anatomically confined than in younger children. There is less swelling of the surrounding soft tissue and less functional restriction. The point tenderness is more circumscribed, though pain is still referred to the involved area when other parts of the long bone are percussed. In older children and adolescents with vertebral osteomyelitis, there may be percussion tenderness over the contiguous spine, hip pain and stiffness, or loss of lumbar lordosis.</p><p>Severe staphylococcal sepsis and venous thrombosis have been described in some adolescents with osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1215103895\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). However, adolescents with <span class=\"nowrap\">subacute/chronic</span> osteomyelitis may have developed a localized, sclerotic, intraosseous abscess (Brodie abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87102\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87102 \">image 1</a>)) and typically present with insidious onset of mild to moderate long bone pain, with or without fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1215104519\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematogenous osteomyelitis generally occurs at only one site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. However, multifocal infection may occur, particularly in critically ill neonates and children with disease caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (CA-MRSA) or sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/4,8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,11,12</a>].</p><p>Long (tubular) bones are affected more frequently than nontubular bones (ie, flat, irregular, and sesamoid bones) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61415 \">figure 1</a>). Infection in nontubular bones occurs most often in the calcaneus and pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The femur and tibia are most frequently involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61415 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Because the long bones are affected in the majority of cases, the clinical features of long-bone osteomyelitis are the &quot;classic&quot; presentation: focal findings of bone inflammation (warmth, swelling, point tenderness), and limitation of function (eg, limp, limited use of extremity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Osteomyelitis of the spine should prompt consideration of <em>Bartonella henselae</em> and other unusual pathogens.

Patients usually are older than eight years. They seek medical attention because of dull, constant back pain. They may appear toxic and markedly febrile after an indolent course with low-grade fever for two weeks' to several months' duration. Examination findings of vertebral osteomyelitis may include exquisite tenderness with percussion of the spinal dorsal process, spasm of the paraspinous muscles around the involved vertebrae, and pain with flexion or extension of the spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a retrospective case series of 14 children with vertebral osteomyelitis, the mean age was 7.5 years and the mean duration of symptoms was 33 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At the time of initial presentation, 8 of the 14 complained of back pain and 11 were febrile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vertebral osteomyelitis is rare in newborns and is difficult to diagnose. Although some infants may be highly febrile and toxic-appearing, most have nonspecific symptoms and signs that are often overlooked, even in closely monitored settings such as neonatal intensive care units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The infant may eventually develop irritability when moved, or have signs of infection at another site. Given the indolent presentation, vertebral osteomyelitis in newborns may be complicated by paraspinal abscess or collapse of one or more vertebral bodies, with secondary kyphosis or paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

Discitis occurs almost exclusively in the lumbar regions. In young children, discitis typically presents with the gradual onset of irritability and back pain, limp, or refusal to crawl or walk, without systemic toxicity; fever usually is absent or low grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/15,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19-21</a>]. Abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting (secondary to ileus) may be the only complaints in children with involvement of T8 to L1.

At the time of presentation, 10 of the 36 were febrile; 23 of the 27 children &lt;3 years of age had a limp or problems walking (eg, unsteady gait, refusal to walk, refusal to bear weight) and 6 of the 9 children &ge;3 years of age complained of back pain. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043401796\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with pelvic osteomyelitis often have symptoms referable to the hip, such as a gait abnormality or hip pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. However, they also may localize the pain to the thigh, abdomen, lumbar spine, or buttocks. Fever is frequently absent. Osteomyelitis of pelvis is generally caused by<em> S. aureus </em>and other gram-positive pathogens, but unusual organisms (including <em>Salmonella</em> species and <em>B. henselae</em>) should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].(See <a href=\"#H1043397446\" class=\"local\">'Pathogen-specific features'</a> below.)</p><p>Unlike children with septic arthritis of the hip, children with pelvic osteomyelitis usually allow passive range of motion of the hip (which may be decreased).
