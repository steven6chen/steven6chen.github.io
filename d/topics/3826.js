(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CML is associated with the fusion of two genes: BCR (on chromosome 22) and ABL1 (on chromosome 9) resulting in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This abnormal fusion typically results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), that gives rise to an abnormal chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. It is this derivative chromosome 22 which harbors the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene.</p><p>The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene results in the formation of a unique gene product, the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. This protein product includes an enzymatic domain from the normal ABL1 with tyrosine kinase catalytic activity, but relative to ABL1, whose kinase activity is tightly regulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 is elevated and constitutive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] due to fusion with a portion of BCR. It is this deregulated tyrosine kinase that is implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical hallmark of CML is the uncontrolled production of mature and maturing granulocytes, predominantly neutrophils, but also basophils and eosinophils. In the absence of treatment, CML has a triphasic or biphasic clinical course as it progresses from a chronic phase to an accelerated phase and on to a terminal blast crisis. Sometimes it goes from chronic phase directly to blast crisis, particularly when the blast phase is lymphoid.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CML will be reviewed here. The molecular genetics, biology, and treatment of this disorder are considered separately.

It has an annual incidence of 1 to 2 cases per 100,000, with a slight male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The median age at presentation is approximately 50 years for patients enrolled on clinical studies, but the actual median age from cancer registry data may be 10 years older. Exposure to ionizing radiation is the only known risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>While there is no known familial disposition to CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], rare families in which multiple members develop MPNs, including CML, have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Studies of these families suggest the presence of an autosomal dominant mutation that may predispose to acquisition of a secondary somatic mutation such as the Ph chromosome translocation or JAK2 mutation. It is unknown whether specific genetic variants predispose persons in the general population to develop CML. However, a genome-wide association study of Korean and European cohorts suggested that persons with genetic variants at two chromosomal loci, 6q25.1 and 17p11.1, may be more likely to develop CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

It is estimated that there will be &gt;180,000 patients living with CML in the US by the year 2050 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CML has a triphasic or biphasic clinical course: a chronic phase, which is present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 85 percent of patients; an accelerated phase, in which neutrophil differentiation becomes progressively impaired and leukocyte counts are more difficult to control with treatment; and blast crisis, a condition resembling acute leukemia in which myeloid or lymphoid blasts proliferate in an uncontrolled manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The varying definitions of these disease phases are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Disease phase'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical findings at diagnosis of CML vary among reported series and also depend upon the stage of disease at diagnosis. Twenty to 50 percent of patients are asymptomatic, with the disease first being suspected from routine blood tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. Among symptomatic patients, systemic symptoms such as fatigue (34 percent), malaise (3 percent), weight loss (20 percent), excessive sweating (15 percent), abdominal fullness (15 percent), and bleeding episodes due to platelet dysfunction (21 percent) are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Abdominal pain and discomfort may include left upper quadrant pain (sometimes referred to the left shoulder) and early satiety, due to the enlarged spleen with or without perisplenitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenic infarction. Tenderness over the lower sternum, due to an expanding bone marrow, is sometimes seen. Acute gouty arthritis may also present at this time, due to overproduction of uric acid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other frequent findings include splenomegaly (present in 48 and 76 percent in two series), anemia (45 and 62 percent), white blood cell count above <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span> (52 and 72 percent), and platelet count above 600,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">700,000/microL</span> (15 and 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>].

The white blood cell differential typically shows virtually all cells of the neutrophilic series, from myeloblasts to mature neutrophils with peaks in the percent myelocytes and segmented neutrophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56954\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56954 \">picture 1</a>). Blasts typically account for less than 2 percent. The presence of a greater percent of myelocytes than the more mature metamyelocytes (&quot;leukemic hiatus&quot; or &quot;myelocyte bulge&quot;) is one of the classic findings in CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The granulocytes of chronic phase are morphologically normal with no evidence of dysplasia, but dysplasia can develop in more advanced disease, and particularly in accelerated phase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-peripheral-blood-smear#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear&quot;, section on 'Neutrophil series'</a>.)</p><p>Although morphologically normal, the neutrophils in CML are cytochemically abnormal. The cytochemical reaction called leukocyte (or neutrophil) alkaline phosphatase (LAP, or NAP) when scored is low. The low LAP score is useful in excluding a reactive leukocytosis or &quot;leukemoid reaction,&quot; typically due to infection, in which the score is typically elevated or normal. Low LAP activity was also classically used to exclude polycythemia vera (PV) in the differential diagnosis of CML, in which LAP activity is also often increased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polycythemia-vera\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polycythemia vera&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Absolute basophilia is a universal finding in the blood smears from CML patients, and absolute eosinophilia is seen in about 90 percent of cases. Absolute monocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;1000/microL)</span> is not uncommon, although the percentage of monocytes is typically low (&lt;3 percent) The occasional patients with CML who have an alternate breakpoint in chromosome 22, producing a p190 BCR-ABL1 fusion protein rather than the classic p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, tend to have a more prominent monocytosis and a low <span class=\"nowrap\">neutrophil/monocyte</span> ratio in the peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Platelet counts above <span class=\"nowrap\">600,000/microL</span> are seen in 15 to 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. Low platelet counts or thrombocytopenia, if present at diagnosis, should make one reconsider other diagnostic possibilities, such as one of the myelodysplastic syndromes. A normochromic, normocytic anemia is seen in 45 to 60 percent of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy demonstrates granulocytic hyperplasia with a maturation pattern that reflects that seen in the peripheral smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68724 \">picture 2</a>). Other non-specific bone marrow findings include an increase in reticulin fibrosis and vascularity.

Erythroid islands are reduced in number and size. Small megakaryocytes with hypolobulated nuclei (so-called &quot;dwarf megakaryocytes&quot;) are present. These are smaller than normal megakaryocytes, but not as small as dysplastic &quot;micromegakaryocytes.&quot; Markers of increased cell turnover are commonly noted with Pseudo-Gaucher cells and sea-blue histiocytes. Iron-laden macrophages are reduced or absent.</p><p>The peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate differential count are key components of determining the disease stage. In general, peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts between 10 and 19 percent are diagnostic of accelerated phase disease, while blasts over 20 percent are diagnostic of blast crisis. Additional criteria for accelerated phase are also described, and these are discussed in more detail separately.

Southern blot techniques to identify BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangements were used in the past, but are time consuming and no longer employed as a routine diagnostic test. Evaluating for BCR-ABL1 protein by Western blot analysis is also not typically done. All patients with CML have evidence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62227 \">figure 1</a>), the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or its product, the BCR-ABL1 fusion mRNA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73543 \">figure 2</a>) by at least one of these tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of patients (90 to 95 percent) demonstrate the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) reciprocal translocation that results in the Ph chromosome. Some of the remaining minority have variant translocations such as complex translocations involving other chromosome (eg, t(9;14;22)). The rest have cryptic translocations of 9q34 and 22q11.2 that cannot be identified by routine cytogenetics. These are referred to as &quot;Ph-negative&quot; and require FISH analysis to identify the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, or RT-PCR to identify the BCR-ABL1 fusion mRNA.</p><p>As an example, approximately 15 percent of patients in a large prospective study lacked the Ph chromosome by cytogenetic analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, about one-half of such patients had complex chromosomal rearrangements masking a t(9;22) translocation; another subset was Ph-negative by karyotype but had evidence of BCR-ABL1 gene fusion by metaphase or interphase FISH analysis or RT-PCR. The clinical features of both groups of these patients are very similar to those with typical Ph chromosome positive CML. In contrast, patients whose cells lack evidence of BCR-ABL1 gene fusion by FISH or RT-PCR do not have CML, but may have a related condition, such as a myelodysplastic syndrome or disease with overlapping <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span> features. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>There are several distinct BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins generated from the chromosomal translocation or molecular fusion, depending upon the site of the breakpoint in the BCR gene on chromosome 22.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common abnormal BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript produced is from a breakpoint in exon 13 or exon 14 (alternatively called exon b2 or b3) in the BCR gene, fused to the ABL1 gene at exon a2. These are referred to as e13a2, e14a2 or alternatively as b2a2 or b3a2. These fusions result in a BCR-ABL1 protein with 210 kilodalton molecular mass which is referred to as the p210 BCR-ABL1 protein. This p210 BCR-ABL1 protein has increased and constitutively activated tyrosine kinase activity, as discussed above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less commonly, an alternative e19a2 fusion transcript is found, producing a larger fusion protein with 230 kilodalton weight (p230 BCR-ABL1).

Additional cytogenetic abnormalities develop in over 80 percent of patients in the accelerated and blast crisis phases, most commonly trisomy 8, trisomy 19, duplication of the Ph chromosome, and isochromosome 17q (leading to the loss of the P53 gene on 17p). These can be seen singly in addition to the Ph chromosome or in any combination.

In contrast to CML, the karyotype in JMML is normal or sometimes shows monosomy 7, and progression to acute leukemia is rare.

A patient with a CSF3 proximal membrane mutation demonstrated a dramatic response following treatment with ruxolitinib.

Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with CSF3R mutations. &#160; &#160;</p><p>It is notable that some patients with myeloma or other immunoproliferative disease with increased plasma cells can have marked neutrophilia. This may be due to the secretion of neutrophil-stimulating cytokines from the plasma cells. Such cases likely represent reactive neutrophilia and not CNL. True cases of CNL should have clonal neutrophils that might be demonstrated by a cytogenetic clone or by clonality studies such as the HUMARA analysis. Rare cases of CML have a p230 BCR-ABL1, and these may be associated with either a prominent neutrophil proliferation or a prominent thrombocytosis.

Patients with Ph-positive acute leukemia are heterogeneous when analyzed at the molecular level. At least some of these patients probably represent CML presenting in blast crisis phase, but others may represent de novo acute leukemia. Ph-positive AML, like Ph-positive ALL and CML lymphoid blast crisis, is characterized by frequent chromosomal deletions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) region that are not found in CML myeloid blast crisis, supporting a distinct origin of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Often one can identify the blastic disease and recognize CML in the background in patients who have CML that is presenting in blasts crisis.
