Although it has often been referred to as Graves' ophthalmopathy, it is primarily a disease of the orbit and is better termed Graves' orbitopathy. This topic review will provide an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy. Treatment of this disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Graves' disease, the main autoantigen is the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR), which is expressed primarily in the thyroid but also in adipocytes, fibroblasts, and a variety of additional sites. TSHR antibody and activated T cells also play an important role in the pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy by activating retroocular fibroblast and adipocyte TSHR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The volume of both the extraocular muscles and retroocular connective tissue is increased, due to fibroblast proliferation, inflammation, and the accumulation of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans (GAG), mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. GAG secretion by fibroblasts is increased by thyroid-stimulating antibodies and activated T cells (via cytokine secretion), implying that both B and T cell activation are integral to this process. The accumulation of hydrophilic GAG in turn leads to fluid accumulation, muscle swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59356\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59356 \">picture 1</a>), and an increase in pressure within the orbit. These changes, together with retroocular adipogenesis, displace the eyeball forward, leading to extraocular muscle dysfunction and impaired venous drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72169\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72169 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91472\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91472 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Graves' orbitopathy antigen</strong> &ndash; The TSHR is the prime antigen for Graves' orbitopathy. Immunization of mice with the TSHR induces retroocular adipogenesis, an inflammatory infiltrate, and GAG accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. TSHR mRNA and protein can be detected in orbital fibroblasts and adipocytes, and preadipocytes from patients with Graves' orbitopathy may express more TSHR mRNA and produce more cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in response to TSH than do similar cells from normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although evidence for extrathyroidal TSHR expression is widespread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], this evidence that TSHR expression is greater in the retroocular tissues of Graves' patients when compared with that found elsewhere is compelling. Hence, in addition to TSHR antigen directly activating the immune system, these observations suggest that TSHR expression in vivo is enhanced by an external stimulus from the local inflammatory cells or directly by TSHR antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other autoantigens (eg, insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1] receptor, thyroglobulin) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>], but they are most likely to be secondary in importance to the TSHR in disease initiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Role of TSH receptor autoantibodies</strong> &ndash; High titers of thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies have long been known to correlate with the presence and severity of extrathyroidal manifestations (orbitopathy and dermopathy) of Graves' disease. As the measurement of these antibodies has become more precise, it appears that even in patients with milder disease, there is an independent correlation between these autoantibodies and the prevalence and course of orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There also appears to be significant crosstalk between the TSHR and the IGF-1 receptor in retroocular fibroblasts, such that activation of the TSH receptor by TSH receptor autoantibodies leads to IGF-1 signal transduction and a synergistic effect on GAG production occurs after activation of both receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Role of T-cells</strong> &ndash; The following observations suggest that not just TSHR antibodies but T cells also play a role in the development of orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In vitro studies of retroocular tissue from patients with Graves' orbitopathy have shown that the infiltrating T cells are activated by retroocular tissue fractions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Retroocular fibroblasts secrete GAG in response to cytokines such as interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secreted by helper (CD4+) T cells of the Th1 type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some of the muscle cells and fibroblasts express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II antigens, as seen on thyroid cells in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, which suggests they can present antigen to T cells and resident dendritic cells, thereby serving to perpetuate if not initiate the pathological process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>T cells isolated from retroocular tissue (similar to those isolated from thyroid tissue) have limited V-region genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], and the same genotypes have been seen in the thyroid and retroocular tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3469071310\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism have clinically obvious Graves' orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In a study of MRI in 17 patients with no clinical findings of orbitopathy, 12 had extraocular muscle enlargement, which was bilateral in eight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may increase the risk of orbitopathy in patients with Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence for a genetic component to the pathogenesis of Graves' hyperthyroidism applies equally to the associated orbitopathy. A family history of Graves' disease or Hashimoto's disease, the presence of other autoimmune diseases in the patients and their relatives, and a high percentage of concordance in identical twins (depending on their age), all point toward a major genetic component in these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There is, however, no confirmed, reproducible evidence of a distinct genetic risk for eye disease itself.</p><p>Certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes have been associated with the presence of eye disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], but this has not been a common observation and appears more likely to be the same as for all patients with Graves' disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graves' orbitopathy, like hyperthyroidism, is more common in women than men.

The explanation for this may be that men often have more severe Graves' disease for unclear reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is a confirmed risk factor for Graves' orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>]. As an example, in a case-control study from Australia, the odds ratio for orbitopathy was 2.22 in current smokers compared with never smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Smoking is associated with an increase in the connective tissue volume of the orbit but not the extraocular muscle volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. How this might occur is not known, but direct toxic effects of smoke on the inflamed eyes are likely, and immunologic changes have been described in smokers that could affect the autoimmune process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, in vitro data suggest that cigarette smoke stimulates glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production and adipogenesis in a dose-dependent manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The degree of proptosis is dependent on the depth of the orbit and the degree of enlargement of the retroocular muscles and retroocular fibrous and fatty tissue. The proptosis may be symmetric, but is often asymmetric, and may be accompanied by a sensation of pressure behind the eyeballs. The proptosis may be partially masked by periorbital edema, which is a common accompaniment. In more severe disease, there may be severe conjunctival inflammation and ulceration from over exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2833716512\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, orbitopathy occurs in the setting of current or past Graves' hyperthyroidism (low TSH, high free thyroxine [T4] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triiodothyronine [T3]), but in approximately 10 percent of patients, Graves' hyperthyroidism is absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>]. Such patients are labeled as having &quot;euthyroid&quot; Graves' disease, but they may still have high serum thyroid autoantibody concentrations or circulating thyroid-specific T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Sometimes orbitopathy occurs in patients with hypothyroidism (high TSH, low free T4) due to classical chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease), and these patients may have stimulating TSH receptor (TSHR) antibodies but inadequate thyroid reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>There is usually a temporal relationship between the orbitopathy and the onset of hyperthyroidism. The orbitopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism in approximately 20 percent of patients, concurrently in approximately 40 percent, and in the six months after diagnosis in approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine.

It is, however, important to differentiate the eye signs of Graves' orbitopathy from the nonspecific eye signs of thyroid hormone excess including lid lag and stare (due to enhanced contraction of the levator palpebrae muscles of the eyelids) without proptosis. The stare may give the appearance of proptosis, when none in fact exists. These signs alone do not indicate the presence of orbitopathy and subside when the hyperthyroidism is treated.</p><p>Unilateral Graves' orbitopathy may be considerably more difficult to diagnose in the absence of thyroid dysfunction and must be differentiated from space-occupying lesions of the orbit, typically with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits. Imaging is also performed in patients with moderate to severe Graves' orbitopathy to assess the risk of complications (see <a href=\"#H2015887697\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below) and is sometimes helpful in the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H782238643\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eye signs simulating Graves' orbitopathy can also be present in patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital cellulitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cushing's syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital myositis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diplopia#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diplopia&quot;, section on 'Orbital myositis'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histiocytosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital tumors, including metastatic tumors to the orbit (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-pathway-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic pathway glioma&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Statin-induced extraocular muscle myopathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a patient with Graves' orbitopathy includes laboratory assessment (if not already available), examination of the eyes, and assessment of disease activity and severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3547627351\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid function tests will have already been obtained in most patients.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3469071310\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main autoantigen is the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR), which is expressed primarily in the thyroid but also in adipocytes, fibroblasts, and a variety of additional sites. TSHR antibody and activated T cells play an important role in pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy by activating retroocular fibroblasts and adipocytes. The volume of both the extraocular muscles and retroocular connective and adipose tissue is increased, due to inflammation and the accumulation of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans (GAG), principally <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, in these tissues. GAG secretion by fibroblasts is increased by activated T cell cytokines and by the activation of the receptors for TSH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for the development of Graves' orbitopathy include genetics, female sex, smoking, and prior radioiodine therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major ocular symptoms include one or more of the following: a sense of irritation in the eyes; excessive tearing that is often made worse by exposure to cold air, wind, or bright lights; eye or retroocular discomfort or pain; blurring of vision; diplopia; and occasionally, loss of vision. The characteristic signs of Graves' orbitopathy are proptosis and periorbital edema. (See <a href=\"#H4255905580\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of patients, orbitopathy occurs in the setting of current or past Graves' hyperthyroidism (low TSH, high free thyroxine [T4] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triiodothyronine [T3]), but in approximately 10 percent of patients, Graves' thyroid disease is absent. Orbitopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism in approximately 20 percent of patients, concurrently in approximately 40 percent, in the six months after diagnosis in approximately 20 percent, and after treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism in the remainder (most commonly after radioiodine therapy). (See <a href=\"#H2833716512\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, the diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy is obvious because of the combination of the characteristic ocular abnormalities (proptosis, periorbital edema) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116687\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116687 \">picture 2</a>) and hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H3847024961\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In moderate to severe disease, noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scanning may give an assessment of the risk of future optic nerve compression by enlarged extraocular muscle at the orbital apex and is sometimes helpful in the differential diagnosis.

Severity of disease is an independent measure that assesses threat to vision and the degree of proptosis and soft tissue involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116360 \">table 1</a>).
