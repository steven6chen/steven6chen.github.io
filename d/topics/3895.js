After birth, the DA undergoes active constriction and eventual obliteration. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when the DA fails to completely close postnatally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PDA in full term infants, older children, and adults will be reviewed here. PDA in the premature infant and the management of PDA are discussed separately.

In the typical left aortic arch, the aortic end of the DA arises distal to the left subclavian artery, and the pulmonary end inserts at the junction of the main and left pulmonary arteries.</p><p>The anatomy is more varied in the presence of a right aortic arch. Most commonly, the DA arises from the left innominate artery and inserts into the region of the proximal left pulmonary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Less frequently, the DA arises distal to the right subclavian artery and inserts near the proximal right pulmonary artery. In rare instances, there is a bilateral DA, usually in the presence of other complex congenital cardiovascular anomalies.</p><p>Regardless of the aortic arch orientation, the vascular structures remain anterior to the trachea and esophagus, and there is no vascular ring. One exception to this general rule occurs when there is a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery. In this setting, the DA typically arises from the aberrant subclavian artery and inserts into the proximal left pulmonary artery. This creates a vascular ring with the aorta anterior to and rightward of the trachea and esophagus; the aberrant subclavian artery is posterior, and the DA is along the left side, connecting the subclavian to the pulmonary artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-rings-and-slings#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular rings and slings&quot;, section on 'R aortic arch with aberrant L subclavian artery and L ductus arteriosus/ligamentum'</a>.)</p><p>Histologically, ductal tissue differs from that of the adjacent aorta and pulmonary artery. The intima of the ductus is thicker, and the media contains more smooth muscle fibers arranged in a characteristic spiral fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The DA may take a variety of shapes and forms. The Krichenko classification describes the angiographic appearance of the patent ductus, including several subtypes broadly defined as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A: Conical with the narrowest portion at the pulmonary artery side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B: Short with narrowing at the aortic insertion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type C: Tubular without constriction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type D: Tubular with multiple constrictions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type E: Bizarre, with an elongated, conical appearance and multiple constrictions</p><p/><p>This classification scheme does not include the reverse-oriented ductus, which is commonly associated with congenital heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FETAL AND TRANSITIONAL DUCTAL CIRCULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the fetus, the right ventricle accommodates approximately 60 percent of the total cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The pulmonary vasculature is constricted, resulting in a high vascular resistance within the pulmonary bed. In contrast, the placenta creates a very low resistance bed arising from the aorta, and systemic vascular resistance is low. As a result, the majority of blood exiting from the right ventricle passes right-to-left across the ductus arteriosus (DA) into the descending aorta and on to the placenta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;, section on 'Fetus'</a>.)</p><p>In the fetus, the DA is large, with a diameter approximating that of the descending aorta. With the onset of respiration after delivery, the lungs expand and the systemic oxygen saturation rises, resulting in pulmonary vasodilatation and a drop in pulmonary vascular resistance. At the same time, systemic resistance rises with placental removal after cutting the umbilical cord. These factors lead to a sudden reversal of blood flow in the DA from right-to-left to left-to-right. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;, section on 'Transition at delivery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patency of the ductus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal DA is kept patent by low arterial oxygen content and circulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is produced in part by the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. PGE2 appears to be mediated by its COX-2 isoform, since constriction of the fetal DA in mice is induced by selective COX-2 inhibitors but not selective COX-1 inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rationale for the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants is based upon the role of PGE2 in maintaining DA patency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants#H1214592\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Indomethacin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ductal constriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At birth, the rise in systemic arterial oxygen tension and a decrease in circulating PGE2 levels trigger ductal constriction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the mechanism that causes active ductal constriction is not known, gene transfer studies suggest that an oxygen-sensitive potassium channel mediates DA constriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After delivery, circulating PGE2 levels fall because of reduced production following removal of the placenta, and increased PGE2 clearance due to increase in circulating levels of prostaglandin dehydrogenase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Removal of the strong vasodilatory effect of PGE2 is sensed by the PGE2 receptor (EP4) and promotes further constriction of the ductus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p>Local events including disruption of the vasa vasorum with constriction and release of local growth factors also contribute to closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Constriction of the DA usually results in functional hemodynamic closure within 10 to 15 hours after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Closure begins at the pulmonary end of the DA and proceeds toward the aortic end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and is usually completed by two to three weeks of age. Following initial constriction, a series of histologic changes result in obliteration of the ductus and conversion into the ligamentum arteriosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It appears that these changes do not occur in a PDA, suggesting distinct anatomic differences in the DA tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of an isolated PDA among term infants ranges from 3 to 8 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In a population-based study of 400,000 term infants born in Atlanta from 1998 to 2005, the reported incidence of PDA was 2.9 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In this view, the ductus can be seen arising from the anterior aspect of the descending aorta, which is viewed in cross section. The patent ductus enters the pulmonary artery near the origin of the left pulmonary artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suprasternal view &minus; In the suprasternal notch window, the ductus arises from the descending aorta at the level of the left subclavian artery, and courses anteriorly to join the pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95161\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95161 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95138\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95138 \">movie 6</a>). Moving the transducer just laterally and inferiorly to an infraclavicular position, and rotating clockwise, permits further imaging of the ductus and its relationship to the branch pulmonary arteries and descending aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95162\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95162 \">movie 7</a>).</p><p/><p>In patients with a right aortic arch, the ductus usually arises from the left brachiocephalic vessels instead of the descending aorta and can be followed caudally to its insertion on the pulmonary artery in the suprasternal view.</p><p>The presence of a PDA may mask an aortic coarctation, since the ductus augments the left aortic arch at its origin. The presence of a bicuspid aortic valve, hypoplasia of the transverse arch or aortic isthmus, a long distance between the left carotid and subclavian origins, or a posterior shelf should alert the echocardiographer to the possible presence of a coexistent coarctation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>). An aortic coarctation probability model has been validated for use in neonates with a patent ductus arteriosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Using this model, echocardiographic measurements of the aortic arch may be used to risk stratify infants according to likelihood of the evolution of coarctation with ductal closure, which is used to guide patient management.</p><p>Two-dimensional imaging may give important qualitative information regarding the hemodynamic significance of a PDA.

This jet usually occurs along the leftward aspect of the pulmonary artery, but may be directed into the center or more rightward. In patients with normal pulmonary artery pressure, the high velocity turbulent flow is easily seen in both systole and diastole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95136\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95136 \">movie 3</a>). In patients with high pulmonary vascular resistance, the retrograde jet may be visible only in diastole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95135\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95135 \">movie 4</a>).</p><p>Color flow mapping is particularly helpful in the setting of a small PDA that may be difficult to identify by two-dimensional imaging, especially in adults in whom resolution is more limited than in infants and small children. Determination of the origin of the retrograde flow into the pulmonary artery using two-dimensional imaging as well as color flow mapping is crucial to avoid confusion of the patent ductus with other aortopulmonary shunts, such as collateral vessels, coronary artery fistulae, or an aortopulmonary window.

When the pulmonary artery pressure is lower than systemic arterial pressure, there is continuous left-to-right shunting demonstrated by both color flow mapping and pulsed Doppler interrogation. The velocity of flow across the ductus, measured by either pulsed or continuous wave Doppler, can be translated into the gradient between the aorta and the pulmonary artery using the modified Bernoulli equation. This Doppler-derived gradient correlates with gradients measured at catheterization and can be subtracted from the cuff pressure to estimate pulmonary artery pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95137\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95137 \">image 2</a>). As with any Doppler-derived measurement, care must be taken to minimize the angle between the Doppler interrogation and the direction of flow in the ductus. The length and shape of the ductus may influence the accuracy of gradient estimates using the Bernoulli equation; longer and more &quot;tunnel&quot; like structures are less reliably evaluated using this equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In the setting of a large left-to-right shunt at the DA, continuous runoff can be seen in the branch pulmonary arteries and in the aorta proximal to the PDA by pulsed Doppler echocardiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95164\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95164 \">image 3</a>).

The finding of systolic right-to-left flow within the ductus may be confused with normal antegrade systolic flow in the left pulmonary artery if the sample volume is not placed within the ductus.

Paradoxically, in the setting of the patent ductus arteriosus, the systemic blood flow is calculated by using the area of the right ventricular and pulmonary outflow tracts and velocity time integrals, and the pulmonary blood flow is calculated utilizing the aortic outflow tract area and velocity time integral. However, the ductal jet frequently distorts the antegrade pulmonary flow signal; as a result, this measurement is not usually helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Information regarding right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure may also be derived by determination of tricuspid regurgitation velocity and, qualitatively, by ventricular septal configuration.</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography can be used for identification of a PDA, but the PDA may be difficult to visualize using this technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">M-mode echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although M-mode echocardiography may reveal findings suggesting a left-to-right shunt, it is not diagnostic for a PDA.
