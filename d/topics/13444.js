Most patients with CKD have only moderate reductions in eGFR and are at a much higher risk of morbidity and death related to cardiovascular disease than of eventually requiring renal replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a significant clinical issue among patients with CKD. Traditionally, most studies of the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease did not report subgroup analyses among patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>], and epidemiologic studies of PAD have generally not included CKD as a potential risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. However, a growing number of studies have now described an association between PAD and CKD.</p><p>This topic will focus on aspects of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PAD relevant to individuals with CKD. CKD will refer to individuals with decreased kidney function, excluding dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients. A review of this issue among patients with end-stage renal disease, and more detailed management recommendations for PAD in the general population are presented separately.

To some extent, this may reflect the older age and higher prevalence of known risk factors for PAD such as dyslipidemias, diabetes, hypertension, and other forms of vascular disease among those with CKD; however, even after adjustment for these potential confounders, CKD is independently associated with an increased prevalence of PAD, and with the future risk for developing clinically significant PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

Patients with CKD are also at increased risk for developing clinically significant PAD even after adjustment for other known risk factors, such as older age and diabetes. Furthermore, PAD and CKD appear to have a synergistic effect on mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have reported the prevalence of intermittent claudication in the general adult population to be 1 to 5 percent, with a higher prevalence among men and older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7,8,16,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,16,27-32</a>].

The prevalence of PAD in patients with CKD is even higher using additional imaging studies to identify arterial occlusive disease compared with using symptoms (eg, claudication) or ABI criteria alone. In the Finnish study, the prevalence of PAD (abnormal ABI or TBI, or history of abnormal lower extremity arteriogram) was 22 versus 2 percent among patients with CKD and controls, respectively, compared with 15 and 0 percent, respectively, using ABI alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In another study in which 29 percent of patients were diabetic, PAD was defined as an ABI &le;0.90, or TBI &le;0.60 with medial arterial calcifications in the face of an incompressible ABI &ge;1.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Using this definition, the prevalence of PAD was 22, 31, and 15 percent among predialysis, dialysis, and kidney transplant patients, respectively, and the prevalence of medial artery calcifications was 24, 42, and 21 percent, respectively.</p><p>CKD may also be a risk factor for the development of severe PAD requiring lower extremity revascularization or amputation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Cardiovascular Health Study, individuals with CKD at baseline had a higher incidence of intermittent claudication (10.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/1000</span> patient-years) compared with individuals with normal kidney function (3.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/1000</span> patient-years), after a median follow-up of 7.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Heart and <span class=\"nowrap\">Estrogen/Progestin</span> Replacement Study (HERS), incident lower extremity PAD event rates (revascularization, amputation, or lower extremity sympathectomy) among women with creatinine clearances 30 to 59 and &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m2 were 0.9 and 2.7 percent per year, respectively, compared to 0.6 percent per year among women with normal kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely similar in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Patients with CKD had more severe disease at presentation with 77 and 87 percent of those with estimated GFR 30 to 59 and &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m2, respectively, presenting with gangrene or ischemic ulceration rather than rest pain (versus 70 percent among patients with estimated GFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m2). In the same study, the presence of CKD was associated with substantially higher one year mortality among patients with critical limb ischemia (50 versus 26 percent among those without CKD).</p><p>The 2005 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> guidelines identify &quot;severe renal failure&quot; as a condition associated with an increased risk of limb loss among patients with critical limb ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, a large retrospective study of 9932 patients undergoing initial surgical revascularization reported an increased risk of limb loss during the year after revascularization among patients receiving dialysis, but not among other patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is possible that uncertainty regarding the possible benefits may have led to the lower observed rates of revascularization (versus amputation or no procedure) in a cohort of patients with CKD and incident critical limb ischemia compared with patients without CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of noninvasive tests are available to evaluate for the presence and severity of peripheral artery disease (PAD), including assessment of intermittent claudication, ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), exercise treadmill test, and others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity peripheral artery disease in end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis and characterization of PAD using physiologic studies in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may pose some unique challenges. As an example, the ABI may be less reliable in identifying PAD among patients with CKD due to the high prevalence of medial arterial calcification, which can result in falsely elevated lower extremity blood pressure readings due to arterial incompressibility. The previously mentioned Finnish study reported the estimated prevalence of medial arterial calcification as 24 and 3.4 percent among patients with and without kidney dysfunction, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'High ABI'</a>.)</p><p>If the ABI is elevated (&ge;1.3), the TBI may provide a more accurate assessment, as medial artery calcification is less likely to interfere with toe pressure measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An ABI &lt;0.90 and a TBI &lt;0.60 are considered abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58549539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Toe-brachial index'</a>.)</p><p>Although arteriography may be needed to fully evaluate arterial anatomy in patients with critical limb ischemia, the risk of nephrotoxicity related to iodinated radiocontrast administration must be carefully weighed against the benefits of this procedure among patients with CKD. A vascular duplex study may be a helpful preliminary study to identify potential arterial lesions. If revascularization is indicated, imaging and intervention can be planned simultaneously to minimize radiocontrast administration. In addition, efforts to minimize the dose of contrast will help to lower the risk of nephrotoxicity. For patients with distal disease, an antegrade study from the groin selectively imaging the tibial and more distal arteries may provide the necessary information while minimizing contrast exposure. In patients with only modest decrements in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with gadolinium will often provide high-quality digital images that can be used to plan revascularization procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRA is also accurate and can be performed either without contrast or with a gadolinium-based contrast agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the past, MRA with gadolinium was favored over iodinated contrast angiography as a first-line preoperative arterial imaging technique in patients with CKD because of a lower risk of contrast nephropathy. However, administration of gadolinium has been associated with the potentially severe syndrome of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis among patients with more advanced renal failure (dialysis-dependent or estimated GFR less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. In such patients, gadolinium-based imaging should be avoided if possible. There is no consensus among experts concerning the decision to administer gadolinium among patients with an estimated GFR between 30 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. These issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have specifically evaluated the impact of medical treatment on peripheral artery disease (PAD) outcomes, such as symptom relief and need for procedures such as revascularization and amputation. In the absence of better data, recommendations for treating PAD are extrapolated from described or presumed benefit of selected interventions in reducing cardiovascular events or modifying markers of cardiovascular risk. Full discussion of accepted and investigational therapies for symptomatic PAD is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factor modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAD is a marker for more generalized atherosclerosis and is considered a coronary heart disease risk equivalent.

Thus, statin therapy has been recommended for patients with PAD based on their elevated risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The Study of Heart Protection (SHARP) trial supports the efficacy of lipid lowering therapy for reducing cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. This trial randomly assigned 9270 patients with CKD aged 40 years and older to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> 10 mg plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> 20 mg, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The risk of major atherosclerotic events was significantly reduced in the treatment group (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.94) compared with placebo. The need for coronary revascularization was lower in the treatment compared with placebo group. These data suggest that low dose statin therapy and ezetimibe are effective in lowering the risk of atherosclerotic vascular events in patients with CKD, but specific data for PAD are lacking.

A prospective cohort study of 456 patients found that five-year survival rates after lower extremity bypass surgery were significantly decreased among those with stage four and five CKD (23 and 9 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Major amputation was also significantly more likely in those with stage five CKD. </p><p>Compared with non-CKD patients, CKD patients are more likely to undergo amputation rather than revascularization.

Patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD are also at increased risk for postoperative mortality after lower extremity revascularization, but limb salvage rates are not substantially different from the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/34,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,56,57</a>]. This was illustrated in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort study of 9932 patients undergoing an initial surgical revascularization procedure, a major amputation occurred within one year of lower extremity surgical revascularization among 10, 11, 12, and 29 percent of patients with normal kidney function, moderate CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m2), severe CKD (estimated GFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m2), and dialysis patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 56 patients with serum creatinine concentration &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> who underwent 70 autogenous vein bypass procedures, the five-year cumulative limb salvage rate was 80 percent, with a primary graft patency of 74 percent and a secondary patency of 77 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This was similar to expected outcomes among patients with normal kidney function at that institution.</p><p/><p>Furthermore, when compared with amputation or no intervention, revascularization appears to be associated with improved survival among patients with CKD. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 6000 male veterans with critical limb ischemia, revascularization was associated with the lowest mortality at each level of kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In analyses adjusted for level of kidney function and comorbidity, a higher odds ratio of death was noted for amputation (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-1.0) and conservative management (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9) compared with revascularization. These results must be interpreted with some caution as they may reflect selection bias rather than a true benefit to revascularization in patients with CKD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Amputation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amputation is considered a last resort in terms of surgical intervention when revascularization has failed or is not an option.

The clinical manifestations of PAD are largely similar in patients with and without CKD, with limited data suggesting that patients with CKD may have more severe disease at presentation and are at increased risk for limb loss. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no data to support screening for PAD in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-artery-disease-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For the diagnosis of PAD in patients with CKD, we recommend using the ankle-brachial index (ABI), and when the ABI is elevated, using the toe-brachial index (TBI). An ABI &le;0.90 and a TBI &lt;0.60 are considered abnormal.
