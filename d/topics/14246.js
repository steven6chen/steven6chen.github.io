The most important of these are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p>The epidemiology and management of occupational exposures to HBV and HCV in HCP will be reviewed here. The prevention of HIV and other pathogens in HCP is discussed separately.

Although the focus on post-exposure management is on HIV, HBV, and HCV, more than 30 different pathogens have caused documented occupational infection following exposure to blood or body fluids in healthcare providers (HCP) or hospital laboratory personnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69942 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>All occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious material place HCP at risk for infection with bloodborne pathogens. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines blood to mean human blood, blood components, and products made from human blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other potentially infectious material includes body fluids such as: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva associated with dental procedures, and body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood. All body fluids should be considered infectious in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between bloody fluids. Any unfixed tissues or organs (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead) are also considered potentially infectious material. For laboratory personnel, other potentially infectious material includes HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, HIV- or hepatitis virus-containing culture medium or other solutions, as well as blood, organs, or tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV, HBV, or HCV.</p><p>The main occupational risk for acquiring a bloodborne pathogen is a percutaneous sharps injury with a contaminated object. Mucous membrane exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material can also transmit HIV, HBV, and HCV. Reports regarding the frequency of such occupational risks are as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CDC estimates that about 385,000 sharps-related injuries occur annually among HCP in hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the Exposure Prevention Network (EPINet) suggest that from 2000 to 2014, there was a significant reduction of both blood and body fluid exposures (BBFE) and sharp object injuries (incidence rate difference 7.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The decrease was most notable from 2000 to 2011, and then leveled off from 2011 to 2014. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the overall decrease in sharp object injuries, data from both from EPINet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and the University of North Carolina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] found that from 2000 to 2014, the rate of sharp object injuries from safety-engineered devices increased. This was likely because of failure to activate the safety-engineered device and inadequate training on the use of such devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from EPINet revealed that in 2015, the rates of needlestick and sharp object injuries and BBFE were greater in teaching hospitals compared with nonteaching hospitals (the rate of needlestick and sharp object injuries was 38.5 versus 19.9 per 100 average daily census [ADC], and the rate of BBFE was 13.6 versus 7.6 per 100 ADC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Underreporting of exposures remains a distinct problem, even in institutions that provide easily accessible reporting systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of exposure by profession</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EPINet data from 2015 documented approximately 1133 percutaneous injuries within its surveillance system. Of those, nurses reported the most frequent number (38 percent), followed by attending clinicians (15 percent), and medical trainees such as medical students, interns, residents, and fellows (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. According to data from the CDC, 18 percent of HCP trainees (ie, interns, residents, and fellows) sustain a percutaneous exposure annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Long work hours and sleep deprivation result in fatigue, which is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of needlestick injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Among HCP trainees, only about 50 percent of percutaneous exposures are reported to occupational health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, in a survey of 699 surgeons in training at 17 medical centers, almost all residents had a history of a needlestick injury by the final year of training, but more than half of the injuries were not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most common reason that such injuries were not reported was lack of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Devices associated with exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common devices involved in percutaneous injuries include disposable syringes (21 percent) and suture needles (24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These sharp devices are most commonly used for suturing, administering injections, or drawing venous blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimizing risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimizing risks to HCP for acquisition of bloodborne pathogens should be an integral part of the infection control and occupational health programs in all healthcare facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/3,8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,13,14</a>]. All healthcare facilities are required by OSHA to undertake measures to reduce occupational exposures to bloodborne pathogens, and include the use of engineering controls that minimize the risk of sharp injuries (eg, needleless intravenous medication systems, blunted suture needles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/9,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,15</a>]. Key measures required by OSHA include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All HCP with &quot;reasonably anticipated&quot; exposure to blood or blood contaminated body fluids must receive yearly education on the epidemiology of bloodborne pathogen transmission and means of minimizing such risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All at-risk HCP must be offered hepatitis B immunization at no cost to the employee. HCP who refuse immunization must sign an OSHA mandated declination form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthcare facilities must provide certain engineering controls proven to reduce exposure to risk, such as leakproof secondary containers for transporting blood and impervious needle disposal containers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthcare facilities must provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and HCP must use PPE when performing procedures during which it is reasonably anticipated that exposure to blood might occur. PPE consists of gloves for possible hand contact with blood, and impervious gowns and <span class=\"nowrap\">face/eye</span> shields when splashes, sprays, or spatters of blood or other potentially infectious material may be generated.</p><p/><p>&quot;Standard&quot; precautions (formerly called universal precautions) should be used for the care of all patients. These precautions consist of wearing gloves when touching blood, body fluids (with the exception of sweat), and contaminated items. A mask, gown, and eye protection or a face shield should be worn during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes and sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions. Hand hygiene is required before and after all patient encounters, even if gloves are worn. In addition, HCP who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis on their hands should refrain from all direct patient care. An additional discussion on the use of standard precautions is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;, section on 'Standard precautions'</a>.)</p><p>Other strategies that have been effective in reducing blood exposures include: double gloving for high risk <span class=\"nowrap\">surgical/obstetrical</span> procedures; blunted suture needles; self-sheathing needles; needleless connectors and infusion sets; and enhanced education (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F96775\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96775 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/8,16-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16-32</a>].

The risk of developing serologic evidence of HBV infection after a percutaneous injury ranges from 37 to 62 percent if the source patient is both HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive, and ranges from 23 to 37 percent if the source is HBsAg-positive but HBeAg-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The risk of developing clinical hepatitis after exposure ranges from 22 to 31 percent if the source patient is both HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive, and ranges from 1 to 6 percent if the source is HBsAg-positive but HBeAg-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Despite the high risk of transmission, the number of HBV infections among HCP declined by approximately 98 percent from an estimated 17,000 infections in 1983 to 263 acute HBV infections in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This is due in large part to efforts aimed at immunizing all HCP against HBV.

The CDC estimates the average incidence of HCV seroconversion to be 1.8 percent (range, 0 to 7 percent) after a needle stick or sharps exposures from an HCV-positive source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

As an example, in a study of 626 UK healthcare workers, the type of procedure (ie, blood sampling versus not blood sampling) and depth of injury (ie, deep versus superficial) were independently associated with an increased risk of HCV seroconversion (adjusted odds ratios of 5.75 and 21.99, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The introduction of hepatitis B vaccination for HCP has been highly successful in reducing HBV infection.
