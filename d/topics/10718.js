Skeletal involvement is most common in patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer, but bone is a frequent site of metastases in most advanced malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the overall incidence of bone metastasis is not known, over one-half of people who die of cancer in the United States each year are thought to have bone involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Bone metastases can cause a wide range of symptoms that can impair the quality of life or shorten survival. Direct complications of bone involvement include severe pain, pathologic fractures, and epidural spinal cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition to these local effects, osteolytic metastases can result in life-threatening hypercalcemia.

The control of normal bone remodeling is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OSTEOLYTIC VERSUS OSTEOBLASTIC BONE METASTASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone metastases are generally classified as either osteolytic, characterized by destruction of normal bone, or osteoblastic, with the deposition of new bone based upon the predominant radiologic appearance. This distinction is not absolute; many patients with bone metastases have both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions, and individual metastatic lesions can contain both osteolytic and osteoblastic components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54124 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In both types of lesions there is a dysregulation of the normal bone remodeling process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption#H1207796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;, section on 'Bone modeling and remodeling'</a>.) </p><p>The spectrum of osteolytic and osteoblastic bone involvement is illustrated by three tumors that are frequently associated with skeletal metastases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple myeloma &mdash; The classical bone lesions in multiple myeloma are purely osteolytic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78569\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78569 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These lesions are often not detectable by bone scans, which rely upon technetium uptake to identify areas of new bone formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Multiple myeloma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate cancer - The predominant lesion in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer is osteoblastic with increased numbers of irregular bone trabeculae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83139\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83139 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although these metastases are osteoblastic, there is increased bone resorption as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, agents that block bone resorption are used to decrease bone pain and the risk of pathologic fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-management#H19250956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Management&quot;, section on 'Osteoclast inhibition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cancer - Although bone metastases due to breast cancer are predominantly osteolytic lesions, osteoblastic areas are also usually present and at least 15 to 20 percent of cases have predominantly osteoblastic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, destruction of bone in osteolytic lesions induces secondary new bone formation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Breast cancer'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Research is beginning to elucidate the multiple mechanisms that cause these different patterns of metastases, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE AS A PREFERENTIAL SITE FOR METASTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferential localization and growth of tumor cells in bone is caused both by properties of the tumor cells and by factors in the bone microenvironment. This involvement of both the tumor and the bone microenvironment has been referred to as the &quot;seed and soil&quot; hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Tumor cells may produce or express various adhesive molecules, which bind to the corresponding receptors on the stromal cells of the marrow and bone matrix. Examples of such factors include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR4 that mediates their attachment to the stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12) in bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Increased expression of CXCR4 in primary neuroblastoma tumors has been associated with a higher frequency of bone and bone marrow metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) in bone may also contribute to the development of bone metastases by binding to its receptor (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B, RANK) on the surface of tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Further, RANKL may also mediate progestin-induced epithelial proliferation and carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and high <span class=\"nowrap\">RANKL/RANK</span> expression in breast adenocarcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis and metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of bone sialoprotein by non-small cell lung cancer may facilitate binding to collagen type I and other components of the extracellular matrix in bone. Expression of bone sialoprotein in the primary tumor has been correlated with the subsequent development of bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Annexin II and its receptor may be involved in prostate cancer cells homing to bone. Prostate cancer cells and myeloma cells bind to annexin II and the annexin II receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] on osteoblasts, analogous to hematopoietic stem cells.</p><p/><p>These adhesive interactions between tumor cell receptors and the bone microenvironment can increase production of angiogenic factors and bone resorbing factors by the tumor cells. This in turn can further enhance tumor growth in bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In addition, bone contains various growth factors that are released and activated during the process of bone resorption, further stimulating tumor growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These include transforming growth factor-beta, insulin-like growth factors one and two, fibroblast growth factors, platelet-derived growth factors, bone morphogenetic proteins, and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>More recent data suggest an alternative molecular basis for the preferential metastases of prostate cancer cells to the bone. Using a prostate cancer xenograft model, investigators were able to show that prostate cancer cells compete for and co-opt the endosteal niche occupied by hematopoietic stem cells via overexpression of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12 (stromal-derived factor-1), which, through its interactions with CXCR4, regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and homing to the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Further, altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, have been linked to breast and prostate cancer bone metastases. Bone metastases in these two cancers have been associated with increased expression of Core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa1), the master gene controlling osteoblast differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Osteoblasts'</a> below). The increased expression of Cbfa1 in breast cancer cells is caused by downregulation of miRNAs 135 and 203 that normally suppress Cbfa1 gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Replacement of these two miRNAs in breast cancer cells inhibited tumor growth and bone destruction, as well as their capacity for bone metastasis. These results suggest that miRNAs may represent a potential novel therapy for treating bone metastasis.</p><p>Copy number aberrations that result in 16q23 gains in primary breast cancers have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of metastasis to bone but not other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A gene located at 16q23 encodes the MAF transcription factor that controls expression of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is upregulated in breast cancer cells in bone (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Breast cancer'</a> below). These results suggest that MAF overexpression might represent a unique biomarker to identify patients at risk for bone metastasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL BONE REMODELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal bone constantly undergoes a remodeling process that includes the resorption of bone by osteoclasts and the deposition of new bone by osteoblasts. This process is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoclasts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoclasts are derived from precursor cells of monocyte macrophage origin, which differentiate into inactive osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These osteoclasts are then activated, resorb bone, and eventually undergo apoptosis.</p><p>The formation and activation of osteoclasts is regulated by both locally-produced cytokines and systemic hormones. The macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, CSF1) and RANKL are produced by stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes within bone and play a critical role in the formation of osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Systemic factors that induce osteoclast formation, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, and prostaglandins, act indirectly by increasing the expression of RANKL on marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66130 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. RANKL then binds the RANK receptor on precursor cells, inducing the formation of osteoclasts.</p><p>The importance of RANKL in osteoclast formation is supported by evidence from animal models and translational clinical trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knockout mice in which either the RANKL or RANK gene has been deleted lack osteoclasts.

Evidence supporting an important role for OPG is derived from mouse models that either overexpress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] or lack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] OPG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>) was evaluated in a double-blind trial of 54 patients with metastatic breast cancer or multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-bone-metastases/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
