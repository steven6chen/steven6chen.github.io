It hangs down from the large intestine, which is also called the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81580\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81580 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23610525\"><span class=\"h1\">What is appendicitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appendicitis is the term doctors use when the appendix gets infected and swells. When that happens, the appendix can sometimes burst. A burst appendix can be serious, because it can cause a bad infection.</p><p>Appendicitis can happen in children and adults. When it happens in children, it is more likely to affect older children and teens than babies or younger children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23610532\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of appendicitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can be different, depending on a child's age. The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain &ndash; In older children and teens, belly pain is usually the first symptom. The pain might start around the belly button and then move to the right side of the lower belly. Children can also have belly pain that gets worse with coughing or hopping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Fever often starts after 1 to 2 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23610539\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call your child's doctor or nurse if your child has the symptoms listed above. If your child does have appendicitis, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23610546\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your child's doctor or nurse will first ask about the symptoms and do an exam. The doctor or nurse might be able to tell if your child has appendicitis without doing any tests.</p><p>If the doctor or nurse can't tell for sure if your child has appendicitis, he or she might do one or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test such as an ultrasound or CT scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p>No test can say for sure if a child has appendicitis. But the doctor or nurse can use the test results, symptoms, and exam to figure out how likely it is that your child has appendicitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23610553\"><span class=\"h1\">How is appendicitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for appendicitis is surgery to remove the appendix. This surgery can be done in 2 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open surgery &ndash; During open surgery, the doctor makes a cut in the belly near the appendix. Then he or she removes the appendix through that opening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic surgery &ndash; During laparoscopic surgery, the doctor makes a few cuts in the belly that are much smaller than cuts for open surgery. He or she puts long, thin tools into the belly through these openings. One of the tools has a camera (called a &quot;laparoscope&quot;) on the end, which sends pictures to a TV screen. The doctor can look at the image on the screen to know where to cut and what to remove. Then he or she uses the tools to do the surgery.</p><p/><p>If your child's appendix has burst, the doctor will do surgery to remove the appendix. During the surgery, he or she will also clean out the area in the belly around the appendix to wash away the material that spilled out of the burst appendix. This surgery can be more complicated than the surgery that is done if the appendix has not burst.</p><p>If it has been more than a few days since your child's appendix burst, your child might not have surgery right away. That's because the body sometimes forms a wall inside the belly, to block off the area that became infected when the appendix burst. In cases like these, the doctor will first treat your child with antibiotics and watch him or her. He or she might take the appendix out once the antibiotics have made your child feel better, or<em> </em>stick a needle in the walled-off area to drain the infected fluid. This treatment is usually done at the same time as an imaging test, so that the doctor can see where to put the needle.</p><p>After the doctor treats the infection, he or she might recommend that your child have surgery later on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23610560\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=appendicitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Appendicitis in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
