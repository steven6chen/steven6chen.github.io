It is common among critically ill patients, especially those who are intubated or having difficulty communicating with their caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Distress needs to be treated for patient comfort and because it increases sympathetic tone, which may have untoward physiological effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Barring few exceptions (eg, neuromuscular paralysis, procedures) the administration of sedative-analgesic medications should not be based on anticipated distress but rather on that which is observed; otherwise, there will be an increased risk of over sedation which has been shown to worsen clinical outcomes.</p><p>The management of agitation in critically ill adults is reviewed here, including the initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal of pharmacological sedation. Common sedative-analgesic medications, the treatment of pain, and the use of neuromuscular blocking medications in critically ill patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-properties-dosage-regimens-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE-INITIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before a sedative-analgesic agent is initiated to manage agitation, the cause of the distress should be identified and treated. Nonpharmacological strategies are preferred and should be implemented prior to the use of pharmacologic treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify the cause of distress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common causes of distress in critically ill patients include anxiety, pain, delirium, dyspnea, and neuromuscular paralysis. These etiologies may occur separately or in combination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety &ndash; Anxiety is defined as a sustained state of apprehension and autonomic arousal in response to real or perceived threats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fear of suffering, fear of death, loss of control, and frustration due to the inability to effectively communicate are typical causes of anxiety in critically ill patients. Symptoms and signs include headache, nausea, insomnia, anorexia, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, dry mouth, chest pain, diaphoresis, hyperventilation, pallor, tachycardia, tremulousness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypervigilance. <br/><br/>Identifying and treating the proximate cause of anxiety is always ideal as it may ameliorate both problems. Dyspnea, for example, is a common underlying cause of anxiety among critically-ill patients. Thus, if inadequate ventilator flow is causing dyspnea with resultant anxiety, the ultimate treatment for the anxiety (and underlying dyspnea) may be adjustment of ventilator settings. Alternatively, the abrupt onset of anxiety may prompt further work-up for a cardiopulmonary source.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain &ndash; Routine patient care (eg, suctioning, repositioning, physical therapy), immobility, trauma, surgery, endotracheal tubes, and other monitoring devices can all produce pain. Evidence of pain may include grimacing, withdrawal, combativeness, diaphoresis, hyperventilation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tachycardia. While self-report is preferred over behavioral pain scales, pain scales are superior to vital signs alone for assessment of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The assessment and treatment of pain should be viewed as a priority in patients regardless of ability to communicate as pain is likely under reported during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Upon ICU discharge, a significant proportion of patients report experiencing moderate to severe pain during ICU care. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient#H697575174\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;, section on 'Assessment for pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delirium &ndash; Delirium is an organic mental syndrome. It is defined as an acute and potentially reversible impairment of consciousness and cognitive function that fluctuates in severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Delirium occurs in up to 80 percent of ICU patients, but it is frequently unrecognized in older individuals and in patients with hypoactive delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Delirium may be associated with an underlying cause such as infection, iatrogenic such as medications, or environmental. Prior to treatment, patients should be evaluated for a precipitating factor. In the acute phase, delirious patients have impaired short-term memory, abnormal perception, and intermittent disorientation, which is usually worse at night. Electroencephalography may display diffuse slowing. Delirium due to drug or alcohol withdrawal typically presents as a hyperactive delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;, section on 'Delirium tremens (DT)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.) <br/><br/>Delirium is a risk factor for prolonged hospitalization and mortality in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Risk factors for delirium include electrolyte imbalances (hypocalcemia, hyponatremia), hyperamylasemia, hyperglycemia, azotemia, hepatic disease (hyperbilirubinemia, elevated hepatic enzymes), infections, drug withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal, malnutrition, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, cardiopulmonary disease, advanced age, and some medications (benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, antihistamines, beta blockers, antiarrhythmics, digitalis glycosides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea &ndash; Dyspnea is a sensation of air hunger or a feeling of suffocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Evidence of dyspnea may include tachypnea, shallow breathing, diaphoresis, tachycardia, use of the accessory muscles of respiration, hypoxemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercapnia. Dyspnea may exist despite acceptable blood gas parameters. Strategies to alleviate hypoxia or dyspnea such as adjustment of ventilator settings, if possible, should be explored prior to the use of medications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular paralysis &ndash; All patients undergoing neuromuscular blockade require pharmacological sedation, since neuromuscular paralysis without sedation or adequate pain control is an extremely frightening and unpleasant sensation. Identifying distress in patients undergoing neuromuscular blockade is difficult because the typical physiological responses associated with stress (eg, increased heart rate and blood pressure with stimulation) may not correlate with patient discomfort in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat the cause of distress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment of agitation should target the presumed cause of the underlying distress. As an example, a patient who is agitated due to hypoxemia should receive supplemental oxygen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacological strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacological strategies for managing agitation should begin simultaneously with therapy targeting the cause of distress (since the cause of the distress is rarely quickly reversible). Nonpharmacological strategies include reassurance, frequent communication with the patient, regular family visits, establishment of normal sleep cycles, and cognitive-behavioral therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Examples of cognitive-behavioral therapies include music therapy, guided imagery, and relaxation therapy.</p><p>This strategy of using nonpharmacological interventions to control agitation, rather than immediately initiating pharmacological sedation, is supported by evidence: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial randomly assigned 140 mechanically ventilated patients to receive either a strategy of no sedation followed by continuous verbal comforting and reassurance or continuous sedation with daily interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Only when nonpharmacologic interventions failed were patients treated with a continuous sedative infusion with daily interruption. The trial found that patients managed with a strategy of no sedation had more ventilator-free days and a decreased length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and incidence of delirium. There was no difference in post-traumatic stress disorder, quality of life, depression, or recall of the ICU experience in survivors approximately two years after randomization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized multicenter trial of 373 mechanically ventilated patients reported that, compared to usual care (UC) or noise-cancelling headphones (NCH), patient directed self-initiated music (PDM; with preferred selections tailored by a music therapist) was associated with a reduction in the visual analog scale for anxiety (52 versus 33) throughout the study period (up to 5.7 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, by the fifth day, PDM was associated with a reduction in sedation intensity (sedation intensity score 4.4 versus 2.8) and frequency (5 doses versus 3 doses of study-approved sedative). These findings were confirmed in a meta-analysis of 14 trials examining the impact of music in mechanically ventilated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedative-analgesic medication is indicated when treatment of the cause of the distress and nonpharmacological interventions cannot sufficiently control the agitation. The Society of Critical Care Medicine has published guidelines regarding the selection and initiation of sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Available agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedative-analgesic medications that are commonly used in the intensive care unit (ICU) include benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>), opioid analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69394 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. Agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>) and antiepileptics can be used as adjunctive therapy when indicated. All these agents differ in their amount of anxiolysis, analgesia, amnesia, and hypnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51282 \">table 2</a>). Their mechanisms, properties, dosage regimens, and potential adverse effects are reviewed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79667 \">table 3</a>).

The Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines favor nonbenzodiazepine agents due to evidence of shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, but the optimal agent for short-term or long-term therapy is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Selection of an agent must be individualized according to patient characteristics and the clinical situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Important considerations when selecting a sedative-analgesic agent include the etiology of the distress, expected duration of therapy, clinical status of the patient, and potential interactions with other drugs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etiology of the distress &ndash; The appropriate initial pharmacological agent for managing agitation due to distress depends upon the cause of the distress. For distress due to dyspnea or pain, opioids are the agents of choice. For distress due to delirium, antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>) are preferred. For distress due to anxiety, benzodiazepines should be considered. Combination therapy is appropriate for patients with more than one cause of distress. As an example, a benzodiazepine plus an opioid is appropriate for a patient whose agitation is due to anxiety and pain. For patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated and not able to clearly communicate the source of agitation, analgesia should always be provided first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Abnormal pharmacokinetic modifying variables can magnify differences among the sedative-analgesic agents (eg, onset, peak, duration of sedation), especially during deep or long-term sedation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial dose of a sedative-analgesic agent should account for the desired level of sedation ability to tolerate the drug including hemodynamic and respiratory status as well as factors that may affect drug metabolism (ie, patient age, body weight, renal function, hepatic function, drug interactions, history of alcoholism, history of drug abuse). Higher doses are appropriate for deeper sedation and larger patients, while lower doses are appropriate for lighter sedation, smaller patients, patients with advanced age, diminished renal function, or decreased hepatic function. Patients with a history of alcohol or abuse may require higher doses of benzodiazepines or opioids, respectively, to achieve a given effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-properties-dosage-regimens-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence indicates that continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As a result, current practice favors intermittent bolus doses, daily interruption or dose minimization titrated to light level of sedation (RASS -2 to 0) of continuous infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clinical practice guidelines for the sustained use of sedatives and analgesics in critically ill adults endorse the initial use of intermittent bolus dose, with the initiation of continuous infusions with daily interruption or dose minimization titrated to light level of sedation (RASS -2 to 0) in patients who require intermittent infusions more often than every two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal sedation goal is for the patient to be awake and comfortable with minimal to no distress (eg, 0 on the RASS scale) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57874 \">table 4</a>), although some patients may require a deeper level of sedation for optimal management. The sedation goal should be ascertained at the bedside for each patient; there is no one size that fits all. The notion that all mechanically ventilated patients should receive sedatives targeted to a specific sedation score, such as a RASS score of -2, will lead to the over sedation of many patients and may slow recovery (eg, by eliminating the opportunity for daily physical therapy). In contrast, a proportion of critically-ill, mechanically-ventilated patients require a very deep level of sedation-analgesia to control agitation or pain. A patient-centered approach, derived by the bedside clinician, is best and should be used to determine the appropriate goal for the depth of sedation. This goal should be determined prior to beginning or escalating sedative-analgesic medications, since this is the target to which initial therapy is titrated. As examples, lighter sedation may be desired when serial neurological exams are required, while deeper sedation may be desired during severe hypoxemic respiratory failure.</p><p>The goal depth of sedation should be frequently reassessed and adjusted as the patient's sedation requirement becomes more apparent. Some patients require no sedation, while others require deep sedation to be mechanically ventilated without discomfort, agitation, or asynchrony.</p><p>The depth of sedation is typically assessed during the initiation of pharmacological sedation using criteria such as spontaneous movement and response to verbal and tactile stimuli. Scoring systems have been developed to make evaluation of the depth of sedation more rigorous and quantitative, but these systems are more commonly used during the maintenance of sedative-analgesic therapy, as described below. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTENANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the initiation of the sedative-analgesic agent achieves a calm state, attention should be directed toward monitoring and avoiding excess sedation. This involves frequent reassessment of pain and sedative requirements to achieve simultaneous patient comfort in an awake and alert patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maintenance of pharmacological sedation requires that patients be reassessed frequently to determine whether their agitation and underlying distress are being adequately managed. Scoring systems have been developed to facilitate this evaluation.</p><p>There are scoring systems (ie, scales) to assess pain, sedation, and delirium. The scale appropriate for the presumed cause of distress should be employed. As an example, if the distress was felt to be due to pain and an opioid was initiated, then assessment using a pain scale is appropriate. If the goal of therapy is sedation, then a scale assessing level of sedation should be used.</p><p>Once the appropriate scoring system has been used to determine whether the agitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> underlying distress is sufficiently controlled, the sedative-analgesic medication should be titrated or tapered to meet the therapeutic goals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Scoring systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scoring systems use multiple criteria to determine the amount of pain, depth of sedation, or presence or severity of delirium. An important limitation of the scoring systems is that reference standards do not exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain scales &ndash; There exist unidimensional scales (ie, verbal rating scale, visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale) and multidimensional scales (ie, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire) to assess a patient's level of pain. The unidimensional scales can be quickly and easily applied in the intensive care unit if the patient is communicative. As an example, the numeric rating scale is a zero to ten point scale on which ten represents the worst pain. Patients choose the number that best describes their pain. The multidimensional scales are more complex and take longer to administer; thus, they may not be appropriate for the intensive care unit. The Behavioral Pain Scale and the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool are simple, valid, and reliable pain scales for pain assessment in critically ill patients and are recommended as scales of choice by current guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation scales &ndash; There are numerous scoring systems to assess the depth of sedation that are valid and reliable in adults who are mechanically ventilated and critically ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. Current guidelines support the use of the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57874 \">table 4</a>) and the Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, a rapid bedside instrument that can identify delirium in critically ill patients is the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) is also a simple and valid tool for bedside assessment of delirium. Both scales assess patients for acute mental status changes or fluctuating mental status changes, inattention, disorganized thinking, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an altered level of consciousness. Both the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC can identify new or persistent delirium, but neither quantify the severity of the delirium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Recognizing the disorder'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are pharmacologically paralyzed, monitoring is challenging because the scoring systems cannot determine the level of pain, depth of sedation, or presence of delirium. Heart rate and blood pressure have historically been used as indicators of distress in this situation, but these vital signs are neither sensitive nor specific. We believe that there are two reasonable approaches. Pharmacologically paralyzed patients can be given higher than usual doses of both an <span class=\"nowrap\">anxiolytic/amnestic</span> and an analgesic to ensure deep sedation. Alternatively, bispectral index (BIS), auditory evoked potentials, or other objective monitoring systems can be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81084\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81084 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The latter approach may limit drug accumulation.</p><p>BIS monitoring uses Fourier transform analysis of electroencephalographic data to estimate the depth of sedation. It is used primarily during operative anesthesia in patients without underlying neurologic disease. BIS monitoring is not used routinely in the ICU because there are conflicting data regarding its benefit and electromyelographic activity from the scalp muscles creates artifact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-37</a>]. We believe BIS monitoring is a reasonable approach to assessing depth of sedation in ICU patients receiving neuromuscular paralysis; however, we agree that BIS monitoring should not replace the clinical assessment of sedation in the routine management of ICU patients until more favorable data are reported. Also, clinicians should recognize the potential for misinterpretation of the BIS algorithm in patients with electromyographic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid excess sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedative-analgesic medications should not be overused because excess sedation may unnecessarily prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/19,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,39,40</a>]. Two strategies have been shown in randomized trials to reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation: intermittent infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/19,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,41</a>] and the daily interruption of continuous infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. Both of these approaches have been protocolized in many ICUs in an attempt to avoid excess sedation; however, the value of protocols in this regard remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent infusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An observational study of 242 patients compared the duration of mechanical ventilation among patients who received a continuous sedative-analgesic infusion to those who received either intermittent sedative-analgesic infusions or no sedative-analgesics based on a nursing protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The group that received intermittent infusions or no medication had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (median of 56 hours) than the group that received a continuous infusion (median of 185 hours).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Daily interruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daily interruption of sedation refers to discontinuing the continuous sedative-analgesic infusion until the patient is awake and following instructions, or until the patient is uncomfortable or agitated, and deemed to require the resumption of sedation. The rationale for the daily interruption of continuous sedative-analgesic infusions is that it facilitates assessment of the patient's underlying neurologic status, as well as the patient's need for ongoing sedation. Randomized trials and meta-analyses report possible benefit from daily interruption with regard to reducing duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among trials which limits interpretation of the analysis. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 128 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation and a continuous sedative-analgesic infusion, patients were randomly assigned to continue conventional management or to undergo daily spontaneous awakening trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The spontaneous awakening trials consisted of interruption of the continuous infusion until the patient was awake. The group whose continuous infusion was interrupted daily had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (4.9 versus 7.3 days) and length of ICU stay (6.4 versus 9.9 days), as well as fewer neurodiagnostic tests. Limitations of the trial include that it was performed in a single center, ventilator weaning was not standardized, and the spontaneous awakening trials were monitored closely by study personnel, which is not feasible in most ICUs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar trial randomly assigned 336 patients to a daily spontaneous breathing trial and either a daily spontaneous awakening trial or conventional sedation management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The daily spontaneous awakening trial group had decreased one-year mortality (but not 28-day mortality), an increased number of ventilator-free days, a decreased length of ICU stay, and a decreased length of hospital stay. The group also had less cognitive impairment at three months (absolute risk reduction of 20 percent), although there was no difference at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of nine trials demonstrated only marginal reductions in the duration of mechanical ventilation (13 percent), ICU and hospital length of stay (10 and 6 percent, respectively) when compared with strategies that do not utilize daily sedative interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There was no difference in risk of death, rate of accidental endotracheal tube removal, incidence of new onset delirium, or in the doses of sedative administered. The confidence intervals were wide which indicates imprecision and limits interpretation of the analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of six randomized trials of mechanically ventilated patients in closed nonspecialty ICUs reported that, compared with usual care, protocolized sedation (algorithm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> daily interruption) was associated with a rate reduction in overall mortality (15 percent), length of hospital stay (3.5 days), and tracheostomy (31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. There was no difference on the duration of mechanical ventilation and rate of self-extubation or re-intubation. &#160; </p><p/><p>While these trials indicate that daily interruption of continuous sedative-analgesic infusions are beneficial, compliance to protocols can be challenging, and the benefit may be less or absent if a sedation protocol is also being concurrently used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. This was illustrated by a multicenter trial in which 430 mechanically-ventilated patients were randomly assigned to receive protocolized sedation (PS) alone or protocolized sedation plus daily interruption (PS+DI) of their continuous sedative-analgesic infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The median time to successful extubation, the primary outcome, was seven days in both groups. The PS+DI group had higher mean doses of infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> as well as a greater number of boluses of benzodiazepines and opiates, than the PS group. No differences were noted in the rates of unintentional removal of medical devices, ICU delirium, diagnostic neuroimaging, or tracheostomy. Of note, the average daily dose of midazolam was higher in both groups in this study than in the daily interruption trial described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The seemingly disparate results from the two clinical trials may be reconciled by the notion that protocolized weaning of sedation by the bedside nurse (as in the control group of the PS versus PS+DI study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]) can effectively achieve the minimal effective sedative dose requirement for patients. This would explain the lack of any further benefit, when the minimal effective dose is interrupted. </p><p>Concerns related to patient safety have been a significant obstacle to implementation of daily interruption of continuous sedative-analgesic infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. These concerns include the possibility of long-term psychological sequelae (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and myocardial ischemia. There is little evidence to support these concerns, as demonstrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study performed using patients from the first randomized trial described above plus contemporaneous patients that were not enrolled in that trial found that patients who received daily interruption of their continuous sedative-analgesic infusion did not experience adverse psychological outcomes and were less likely to have symptoms of PTSD than those who received conventional management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the trial described above that randomly assigned 336 patients to a daily spontaneous breathing trial and either a daily spontaneous awakening trial or conventional sedation management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], there was no difference in the frequency of PTSD at 3 or 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study evaluated 74 patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease who were receiving mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Electrocardiographic monitoring was performed during the continuous sedative-analgesic infusion and during interruption of the continuous infusion. Myocardial ischemia (defined as ST segment elevation or depression &gt;0.1 mV from baseline lasting 10 minutes or longer) was identified in 24 percent of the patients at some time during the study. Myocardial ischemia was not more common during interruption of the continuous infusion, although heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and catecholamines increased significantly. The study did not address the cumulative effects of multiple days of interrupting the continuous infusion.</p><p/><p>We believe there is sufficient evidence to justify efforts to minimize sedative-analgesic infusions, although the optimal method (eg, protocol-driven intermittent infusions, daily interruption, or a combination) is not known. Additional studies focusing on efficacy, feasibility, and safety are needed to determine the optimal approach. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">WITHDRAWAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When pharmacological sedation is no longer necessary, the sequence and rate of discontinuing the sedative-analgesic agents must be determined:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving more than one sedative-analgesic medication (eg, a benzodiazepine and an opioid), the opioid should be tapered last so that the patient does not awake in pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of the reduction should be individualized. Generally speaking, abrupt discontinuation is acceptable if the sedative-analgesic agent has been administered for a short duration (&le;7 days). In addition, abrupt discontinuation is also appropriate in patients who have received sedation for greater than seven days who are deeply sedated from prolonged accumulation of medication. However, a gradual reduction (~10 to 25 percent per day) is necessary if the sedative-analgesic agent has been administered for &gt;7 days and the patient exhibits evidence of tachyphylaxis, with increasing dosage required over time to achieve the same level of sedation.</p><p/><p>It is important for clinicians to realize that there may be a delay (ie, days) between the moment that reduction of the sedative-analgesic agent begins and the patient begins to awaken, particularly following long-term therapy. This is because lipophilic drugs accumulate in tissue stores and must be mobilized for elimination.</p><p>During the reduction of the sedative-analgesic medication, the patient should be closely observed for withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms in this setting appear to be common. In an observational study of 28 mechanically ventilated patients who had been in the ICU for greater than one week, nine patients (32 percent) developed acute withdrawal symptoms when their sedative-analgesic medication was reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Higher doses of benzodiazepines and opiates conferred a higher risk of withdrawal.</p><p>Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms include agitation, confusion, anxiety, tremors, tachycardia, hypertension, and fever. Seizures may also occur. The administration of intermittent intravenous or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (0.5 to 1 mg every 6 to 12 hours) may help protect the patient from developing withdrawal symptoms as the continuous benzodiazepine infusion reduced.</p><p>Opiate withdrawal symptoms include agitation, anxiety, confusion, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, diaphoresis, mydriasis, piloerection, stomach cramps, diarrhea, tremor, nausea, vomiting, chills, tachycardia, hypertension, and fever. Several strategies have been proposed for preventing opioid withdrawal, including de-escalating the dose, converting to a longer acting oral equivalent, converting to a long-acting barbiturate (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>), and adding an alpha-2-agonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. However, there are no controlled trials of any strategy and there is no consensus as to the best strategy. Data are limited to case reports, including two reports in which dexmedetomidine was initiated at a dose of 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour</span> (with or without a loading dose) and successfully facilitated opioid withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distress is common in critically ill patients, particularly among those who are intubated or have difficulty communicating with their caregivers.

As the respiratory failure or other critical illness is treated, the sedative requirement should fall. Thus, daily attempts should be made to reduce the level of sedation, although the rate of the reduction must be individualized. For patients receiving more than one sedative-analgesic medication, we taper the opioid last so that the patient does not awake in pain. During the reduction of sedation, the patient should be closely observed for withdrawal symptoms.
