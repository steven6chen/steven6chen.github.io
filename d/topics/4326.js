Health professionals, chemical industry workers, beauticians and hairdressers, machinists, and construction workers have the highest risk of developing occupational allergic contact dermatitis. However, exposure to common industrial allergens may also occur at home.</p><p>This topic will review the agents that most commonly cause allergic contact dermatitis.

Nickel, cobalt, gold, and chromium are the most prevalent metal allergens, since they are used in a wide range of everyday items, medical devices, and industrial applications. Co-reactions to metals often occur and should not be considered cross-reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nickel and other metals released by implanted medical devices may cause an allergic contact dermatitis over the implant site or a systemic reaction. Allergic reaction to implanted metals are rarely cause of chronic pain, implant loosening, or failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Criteria for diagnosing hypersensitivity reactions in implant devices have been proposed and are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90288\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90288 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The American Contact Dermatitis Society has published management suggestions for both pre- and postmetal-implant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Nickel is a ubiquitous allergen, with 15 to 20 percent of patch-tested individuals testing positive. Women react more frequently to nickel. It is present in jewelry, kitchen tools and silverware, medical devices, especially stainless steel instruments, clothing, and food. Avoidance of costume jewelry, metal fasteners, and other metal objects is usually sufficient for most nickel-allergic patients. In extremely sensitive individuals, nickel ingestion with foods (eg, chocolate, nuts, oats, green beans, peas, canned foods) may cause systemic allergic contact dermatitis or, in rare cases, chronic urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Cobalt is a co-reactor with nickel and an allergen itself. It has a blue color and can be found in cosmetics, especially eye makeup, and blue tattoo pigments. Other potential sources of exposure to cobalt include wet clay (pottery), plastics manufacturing, bricklaying and other industrial works, and some hair dyes. Surgical stainless steel and the cobalt-chrome-molybdenum alloys used in orthopedic implants have high cobalt content. </p><p>Chromium is also a ubiquitous allergen. It is the fourth most common material in the crust of the earth and is present in both the soil and the water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Chromium is used in the industry (eg, cement, leather tanning, paints), in various types of stainless steel, and as a green coloring agent in soaps, cosmetics, and tattoo pigments. Chromium is also present in some foods, with the highest concentrations in brewer's yeast, beef, liver, thyme, black pepper, and cloves, and in dietary supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Gold in precious jewelry may cause allergic contact dermatitis, most often involving the hands, face, and eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Some patients with a positive patch test to gold, however, may tolerate wearing gold jewelry without problem. Gold dental restorations may be associated with positive patch test reactions to gold in the absence of clinical signs of allergic contact dermatitis or intraoral disease. In one study, approximately 30 percent of asymptomatic individuals with gold dental restorations had a positive patch test to gold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24509081\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESERVATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two main groups of preservatives used to prevent bacterial and fungal spoilage in topical preparations, cosmetics, and personal care products are <span class=\"nowrap\">formaldehyde/formaldehyde</span> releasers and nonformaldehyde agents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3121086\"><span class=\"h2\">Formaldehyde/formaldehyde releasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formaldehyde is a contact sensitizer classified as a known human carcinogen by the <a href=\"http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol88/index.php&amp;token=FAcvYSerQOspmxwxoy9CYi9rleI1QM/VNwjM+oPTezNXMJPvIHfpPwR1W7gOGMzQSzNHAhpJL1WU7qq0410yaQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13656\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a>. Formaldehyde itself is generally not added to consumer products and is rarely listed on labels in the United States and the European Union, but many chemicals used as preservatives degrade over time and release formaldehyde into the product. Cross-reactions may occur between formaldehyde and all the formaldehyde releasers, which are allergens also in their undegraded state. There are regulations in both the United States and the European Union restricting work-place and environmental exposures to formaldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Cosmetics and personal care products that may contain formaldehyde include nail polishes, makeup, body washes, deodorants, and shampoos. Of particular concern is formaldehyde exposure among users of popular hair straightening products (also known as hair relaxers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Rates of formaldehyde releaser allergy have significantly decreased in the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Common preservatives that cause allergic contact dermatitis are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90259 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common formaldehyde releasers used in consumer products are discussed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quaternium-15 </strong>&ndash; Quaternium-15 (Q15) is often present in cosmetics, personal care products, and in some metalworking cutting fluids. In 2003, it was the ninth most common preservative used in the United States and was found in 516 products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Q15 is also the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis to preservatives. According to the North American Contact Dermatitis Group's 2013 to 2014 data, 4.8 percent of patch-tested patients react to Q15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Q15 may occasionally cross-react with other quaternary ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride, often present in eye and ear preparations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imidazolidinyl urea</strong> &ndash; Imidazolidinyl urea is the third most common preservative used in the United States and is present in over 2000 cosmetic and personal care products, including baby lotions, shampoos, conditioners, and deodorants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At the concentration used in cosmetics (0.03% to 0.2%), imidazolidinyl urea releases free formaldehyde at a level of approximately 5 parts per million <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This level can be tolerated by most formaldehyde-allergic patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diazolidinyl urea </strong>&ndash; Diazolidinyl urea is used in many personal care products, often in combination with parabens (see <a href=\"#H471015\" class=\"local\">'Parabens'</a> below). Sources and cross-reactions are the same as imidazolidinyl urea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DMDM hydantoin</strong> &ndash; 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethyl (DMDM) hydantoin is widely used in shampoos, and may also be found in other personal-care products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The amount of formaldehyde released depends upon the concentration and presence of protein in the product, and ranges from approximately 40 to 500 parts per million <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Products containing Bronopol include body-cleansing products, in particular baby wipes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41808777\"><span class=\"h2\">Other preservatives</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519382924\"><span class=\"h3\">Isothiazolinones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI) and methylisothiazolinone (MI) are commonly used preservatives and an important cause of product-related allergic contact dermatitis. Rates of MCI and MI allergy among patch-tested patients have significantly increased over the last years, from 2.8 percent in 2005 to 2006 to 5 percent in 2011 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and 6.4 percent in 2013 to 2014. In a series of 703 patients tested between December 2014 and January 2015, the prevalence of positive reactions to <span class=\"nowrap\">MCI/MI</span> was 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Exposure sources include wash-off personal care products, such as hair care products and body washes, moisturizing <span class=\"nowrap\">creams/lotions,</span> premoistened toilet wipes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and laundry detergents. MI was tested by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group for the first time in 2013 to 2014 with a prevalence reported at 10.9 percent, the third most common allergen after nickel and fragrances, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. MI is also used in water-based paints. There are reports of allergic contact dermatitis from airborne exposure in recently painted indoor environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Isothiazolinones are also used in industrial applications with the trade names Kathon CG, Euxyl K100, or Grotan K. The combination of MCI and MI (Kathon CG) is a sensitizer, as are the individual agents alone. Cross-reactions with other isothiazolinones, such as benzisothiazolinone, may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471015\"><span class=\"h3\">Parabens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parabens are the most common preservatives in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, but are the least frequent cause of allergic contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/19,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27</a>]. They are tested in a mix of four related chemicals: methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, propyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, ethyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, and butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. </p><p>In addition to personal care products, parabens are also found in foodstuffs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90275\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90275 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. However, it is uncertain whether oral avoidance of parabens is necessary in sensitized individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Parabens may cross-react with the &quot;para&quot; amino group of related chemicals, such as para-phenylenediamine, the ester class of anesthetics (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a>), and sulfonamides, although the incidence of this is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/19,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9079457\" class=\"local\">'Hair care products'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9079771\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41808800\"><span class=\"h3\">Methyldibromo glutaronitrile</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methyldibromo glutaronitrile is a nonformaldehyde-based preservative with activity against fungi, bacteria, and yeasts. In the past, it was widely used in both the United States and in the European Union in leave-on products, often mixed with phenoxyethanol (Euxyl K400). It was also used in products for industrial use (eg, cutting fluids, coolants, glues and adhesives). </p><p>Common sources include facial and body lotions, cleansers and wipes, moistened toilet paper, fabric softeners, and liquid soaps. In 2007, the European Union established a &quot;no safe use&quot; policy for methyldibromo glutaronitrile and banned it from all personal care products. In the United States, its use is becoming less frequent and it has been removed from some of the commercially available patch testing series. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480113\"><span class=\"h3\">Thimerosal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thimerosal (sodium ethylmercury thiosalicylate) is a mercurial antiseptic and antifungal agent widely used in the past as a preservative in topical preparations, cosmetics, injectable immunoglobulins, and vaccines. Mercury containing agents such as Thimerosal are regulated by the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/hg/regs.htm&amp;token=dTBOilJYMbf5xmv0T7a65fadQRYgbz6OvZHyjIF4KoffXC5d9CT/BhUPzT9fn+qm&amp;TOPIC_ID=13656\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">US Environmental Protection Agency</a> and are rarely used in topical preparations both in the United States and Europe. Thimerosal may be found at low or trace concentration in vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Cross-reactions include other mercurial compounds such as phenylmercuric acetate or dental amalgam. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168067876\"><span class=\"h3\">Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) is a broad-spectrum bactericide and fungicide, used initially in industrial applications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In the last 20 years, its use has spread into many consumer products and it is now the third most common preservative contact allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although the chemical structure of IPBC is similar to thiurams and carbamates used as rubber accelerators, there is controversy about true cross-reactions between these chemicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24509155\"><span class=\"h1\">FRAGRANCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy to fragrance-related chemicals is common. Perfumes and scented personal care products (eg, body washes, hair care products, moisturizing lotions) are obvious sources of exposure. However, many products that are apparently unscented may contain a masking fragrance. Labels indicating &quot;fragrance free&quot; or &quot;unscented&quot; are not always safe for a fragrance-allergic individual to use.</p><p>Fragrance allergens and ingredients commonly tested in patch test screening include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fragrance mix 1 (cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic aldehyde, hydroxy citronellal, amyl cinnamaldehyde, geraniol, eugenol, isoeugenol, and oakmoss absolute)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fragrance mix 2 (Lyral, Citral, citronellol, farnesol, coumarin, cinnamic aldehyde) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Myroxylon pereirae</em>, also known as balsam of Peru</p><p/><p>Patients with a suspected reaction to fragrances should use completely fragrance-free personal care products for six to eight weeks until complete clearance of the allergic rash. After this wash-out period, a prudent use of questionable products may be tried (eg, one or two per week) to identify the cause of the allergic reaction. Lists of fragrance-free products are available from the Contact Allergen Management database. (See <a href=\"#H24509321\" class=\"local\">'Contact Allergen Management Program (CAMP)'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327751\"><span class=\"h2\">Myroxylon pereirae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Myroxylon pereirae</em> (balsam of Peru) is one of the most common contact allergens. It is a resinous sap obtained by cutting the bark of the <em>Myroxylon pereirae</em> tree and is a complex blend of over 400 chemicals classified within the vanilla, cinnamon, benzoate, and eugenol groups. It is largely used in perfumes, cosmetics, flavoring agents in baked goods (vanilla, cinnamon), citrus flavored carbonated beverages, and in some spices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p>Balsam of Peru may also cause systemic dermatitis by oral ingestion. Cross-reactions between balsam of Peru and common foods or spices are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90276%7EDERM%2F90277\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90276 graphicRef90277 \">table 4A-B</a>). Systemic allergic dermatitis due to cinnamon ingestion limited to the eyelids may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9079457\"><span class=\"h1\">HAIR CARE PRODUCTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>P-phenylenediamine is an azo dye intermediate, most commonly used in permanent hair dyes as a black dye. It is also used in black rubbers, photographic developers, fabric dyes, epoxy resin curing agents, oils and greases, and gasoline. Potential cross-reactions include preservatives of the paraben family, para-aminobenzoic acid, sulfonamides (including diuretics and diabetes agents), and benzoic acid ester group anesthetics (see <a href=\"#H471015\" class=\"local\">'Parabens'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9079771\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetics'</a> below). It is important for the patient to understand that even if the hair product is &quot;PPD free&quot; other phenylenediamine variants (eg, Toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate) may cause reactions. </p><p>P-phenylenediamine is often found or reported as an additive in henna and &quot;black henna&quot; and may cause a reaction mistakenly interpreted as henna allergy. The use of pure, uncontaminated <em>Lawsonia inermis </em>(henna tree) should not cause reactions in p-phenylenediamine allergic patients and may actually be a reasonable alternative as a hair dye for some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Pure henna is an extremely rare cause of allergic contact dermatitis. Use of henna followed by indigo (<em>Indigofera tinctoria </em>most commonly) may provide a PPD-free alternative for black hair coloring.</p><p>Cocamidopropyl <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betaine-anhydrous-not-equivalent-to-betaine-hydrochloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betaine</a> is a surfactant derived from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It was originally used in &quot;no more tears&quot; formulations and has since been used as a foaming agent in many wash-off personal care products (eg, shampoos, body washes, toothpastes), an antistatic agent in conditioners, and an emulsifier in cosmetics. The actual allergenic molecule in cocamidopropyl betaine has not been determined. Amidoamine or dimethylaminopropylamine contamination is considered the most likely cause of allergic reactions to cocamidopropyl betaine-containing products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Glyceryl thioglycolate is used in acidic permanent wave solutions, usually in the salon. A similar chemical, ammonium thioglycolate, is used in basic permanent wave solutions and causes allergic contact dermatitis at a much lower rate, although irritant reactions are common. The allergen can persist in treated hair for up to three months. The basic permanent wave solutions are also available for home use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9079630\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPYLENE GLYCOL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Propylene glycol is a viscous, colorless, and virtually odorless alcohol. It is an excellent vehicle, humectant, and preservative. It is commonly added to topical corticosteroid preparations to increase the penetration of corticosteroid into the epidermis and is also an ingredient of underarm deodorant products. Propylene glycol is used as a preservative and solvent for food flavoring agents (E1520). Topical exposure may cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis and ingestion may cause systemic dermatitis and urticarial reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Other common uses include personal lubricants and conduction gels for electrocardiography or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cross-reactions rarely occur with 1,3-butylene glycol and no clear cross-reaction occurs with polyethylene glycol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9079765\"><span class=\"h1\">TOPICAL MEDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9079771\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local anesthetics, particularly the benzoic acid ester group (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a>, procaine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a>) may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Benzocaine is widely used in over-the-counter preparations for itch and pain relief (eg, Vagisil, Lanacane) and as a sexual desensitizing agent. A positive reaction to benzocaine is detected in 0.5 to 4 percent of patients undergoing routine patch testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/1,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,41,42</a>]. Benzocaine may cross-react with other local anesthetic agents and with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) derivatives such as p-phenylenediamine and PABA-based sunscreens (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to local anesthetics&quot;</a>). Local anesthetics of the amide group (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and others) cause ACD at a lower rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9079777\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Neomycin</a> is a topical aminoglycoside antibiotic often used in &quot;triple antibiotic&quot; type preparations.

Although vehicles and preservatives are most often the sensitizing agents, an allergic reaction to the corticosteroid itself can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. Topical corticosteroids have been grouped into four chemically similar, cross-reacting groups (A, B, C, D), ranked from A to D in order of decreasing potential for contact sensitization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63402\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63402 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Oral or parenteral corticosteroids may rarely induce a systemic contact dermatitis in individuals previously sensitized to the same corticosteroid applied topically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

It is derived from pollens and resins of coniferous, poplar, or other trees, and is a complex mix of chemicals, containing approximately 180 different substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Propolis is largely used in traditional medicine for its antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects, and is found in many lip-care products. The main sensitizers in propolis are 3-methyl-2-butenyl caffeate and phenylethyl caffeate; benzoic, caffeic, cinnamic, coumaric, and ferulic acids are other sensitizers present in propolis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Propolis may cross react with balsam of Peru, with which it shares more than 20 substances, and fragrances. Cross reaction with natural beeswax is unusual, but may occur if beeswax is contaminated with propolis. Synthetic beeswax should be safe for propolis allergic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9079550\"><span class=\"h1\">RUBBER ACCELERATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rubber accelerators are chemicals used to speed the polymerization process (vulcanization) in natural latex, synthetic latex, and nonlatex rubber products. They include thiurams, carbamates, and mercaptobenzothiazoles. Thioureas, which are used in the production of neoprene, and antioxidants such as N-Isopropyl-N-phenyl-4-phenylenediamine also may cause allergy to rubber. </p><p>Thiurams and carbamates are the most common cause of accelerator allergic contact dermatitis, according to the 2011-2012 patch-test results of the North American Contact Dermatitis Group, with a prevalence of 2.9 and 4.7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Thiurams most commonly screened are tetramethylthiuram monosulfide, tetramethylthiuram disulfide, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, and dipentamethylene thiuram disulfide. Disulfiram, a thiuram used orally as an aversive agent in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, may cause a systemic contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals. </p><p>Carbamates are commonly tested as a carba mix, which includes 1,3-diphenylguanidine, zinc dibutyl dithiocarbamate, and zinc diethyldithiocarbamate. If carbamate allergy is strongly suspected, 1,3-diphenylguanidine should be tested separately. In addition to latex rubber products, also nitrile materials may contain carbamates. Thus, it can be extremely difficult to find carbamate-free examination or sterile surgical gloves. No clear cross-reactions between carbamates and other chemicals are known, although iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, used as a preservative in cosmetics, has been questioned as a cross-reactor. </p><p>Mercaptobenzothiazole can be found in latex and nonlatex gloves. Nitrile gloves and shoes are the most common source of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Mercaptobenzothiazole is also used as a corrosion inhibitor in cutting oils, antifreeze mixes, greases, adhesives, film emulsions, and in veterinary preparations such as flea and tick powders and sprays. </p><p>Dialkyl thioureas are rubber accelerators and antidegradant agents that are screened in a mix of diethyl- and dibutyl thioureas. They are used in both natural and synthetic rubber systems, as well as in adhesives, commercial paint, glue remover, detergents, fungicides, insecticides, and copy papers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/37,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,50</a>]. The most common sources of exposure are shoes and neoprene (polychloroprene) braces. Co-sensitization with other rubber accelerator chemicals and para-tertiary butylphenol formaldehyde resin are common, as well as cross-reactions in the thiourea group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24509162\"><span class=\"h1\">ADHESIVES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17555214\"><span class=\"h2\">Phenol-formaldehyde resins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Para-tertiary butylphenol formaldehyde resin (PTBFR) is a synthetic polymer mainly used in adhesives. Common sources of exposure include neoprene braces, sleeves, and wetsuits and glued leather products. Other sources include motor oil, printing inks, fiberglass, plywood, and masonry sealants. </p><p>PTBFR can induce both type I and IV reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cross-reactions may occur with formaldehyde, resin monomer, and other formaldehyde-based resins, such as phenol formaldehyde resin, urea formaldehyde resin, melamine formaldehyde resin, and cashew nut oil-formaldehyde resin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17555220\"><span class=\"h2\">Colophony (rosin)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colophony (rosin) is derived from the sap of pine trees. It is a solid residue of distillation of turpentine and its major chemical constituent is abietic acid.<strong> </strong>Rosin is commonly used in adhesives (especially some adhesive bandages), plasticizers, fabrics, <span class=\"nowrap\">asphalt/cements,</span> chewing gum, leather cleaners, photo paper coating, mascaras, and newsprint. </p><p>Rock climbers, gymnasts, dancers, and baseball players commonly use powdered rosin to improve grip. Violinists and players of other string instruments use rosin on the bow hair. Colophony in sanitary pads may cause vulvar dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Cross-reactions include balsam of Peru, turpentine, wood tars, pine resins, and propolis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59616434\"><span class=\"h2\">Epoxy resin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epoxy resin systems are composed of one or more monomers, such as bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin, curing (hardening) agents, and diluents or additives. It is believed that only the monomer, but not the polymer, is allergenic. However, since the polymerization process is often incomplete, the monomer is often present in small amounts in the final product and can elicit an allergic reaction. Epoxy resin plastics and adhesives are frequently used in making sporting goods (eg, tennis rackets), vehicle parts, and in building construction. Nitrile gloves should be used for protection from epoxy resin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24509169\"><span class=\"h1\">ACRYLATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acrylates are used in plastics, adhesives, paints and coatings, paper finishes, dental materials, artificial nails, and many consumer products. Acrylate monomers (eg, acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, and acrylonitrile) react to form polymers that are elastic, resistant to breaking, and transparent. Artificial nail application and nail sculpting with acrylic gels are among the most common exposures to acrylates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Latex gloves do not protect from acrylates. </p><p>Ethyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate are included in many standard patch testing series. Ethyl acrylate is used in dentures and hearing aids, artificial nail products, dental fillings, glues, and inks. Methyl methacrylate is a component of orthopedic bone cement, medical adhesives, corneal contact lenses, intraocular lenses, and hearing aids. Cross-reactions between acrylates are common. However, for patients with a positive reaction to ethyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate, a more extensive patch testing may be helpful in determining which monomers can be tolerated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24509299\"><span class=\"h1\">FABRIC DYES AND FINISHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disperse dyes, particularly disperse blue 106 and 124, are strong sensitizers and a common cause of contact allergy to textiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Disperse dyes are water insoluble and typically used to dye acetate and polyester fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Cross-reactions may occur with p-phenylenediamine, an ingredient of permanent hair dyes, which is a good screening allergen for textile dye allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9079457\" class=\"local\">'Hair care products'</a> above.)</p><p>Textile allergic contact dermatitis typically involves sites that are in close contact with clothing (eg, axilla with sparing of the vault, thighs) and is worsened by friction and sweating. In infants and young children, disposable diapers may be a source of exposure to disperse dyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. </p><p>Ethylene urea melamine formaldehyde and other formaldehyde textile resins such as dimethylol dihydroxyethyleneurea, are<strong> </strong>used as fabric finishes to prevent wrinkling, decrease shrinkage, and improve fabric strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. They are usually found in &quot;permanent press&quot; and &quot;wash-and-wear&quot; type clothing and most often in fabrics that are blends of synthetic and natural fibers.</p><p>A nonevidence-based method for possibly removing formaldehyde from new clothing is soaking in dissolved powdered milk (one-quarter cup powdered skim milk dissolved in approximately 3 gallons of cold water). Clothes should be soaked for approximately 12 hours in a covered container, then rinsed well. While there are no studies proving this method is effective, it is helpful for some.</p><p>Cross- or co-reactions may occur with formaldehyde and formaldehyde-containing or releasing chemicals.
