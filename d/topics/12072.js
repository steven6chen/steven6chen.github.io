It is typically diagnosed by ultrasound examination and may be described qualitatively (eg, normal, reduced) or quantitatively (eg, amniotic fluid index [AFI] &le;5). An adequate volume of amniotic fluid is critical to allow normal fetal movement and growth, and to cushion the fetus and umbilical cord. Oligohydramnios may inhibit these processes and can lead to fetal deformation, umbilical cord compression, and death.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to oligohydramnios. Methods of amniotic fluid volume assessment are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-amniotic-fluid-volume\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of amniotic fluid volume&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported rates of oligohydramnios are influenced by variations in diagnostic criteria, the population studied (low or high risk, screening or indicated ultrasound examination), the threshold used, and the gestational age at the time of the ultrasound examination (preterm, term, or postterm).</p><p>A study of 3050 uncomplicated pregnancies with singleton non-anomalous fetuses between 40 and 41.6 weeks of gestation noted oligohydramnios (defined as AFI &le;5 cm) in 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence is particularly high in laboring women, largely due to rupture of fetal membranes during or just before labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of amniotic fluid is ultimately determined by the volume of fluid flowing into and out of the amniotic sac. Fetal urination, egress of lung fluid, and swallowing all make important contributions to fluid movement in late gestation, with minimal contributions from other sources. Fetal disorders that affect any of these processes will affect the amniotic fluid volume. As an example, growth restricted fetuses may redistribute blood flow away from their kidneys, which decreases fetal urine production, resulting in oligohydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Homeostatic mechanisms, such as intramembranous absorption (transfer of amniotic fluid across the amnion into the fetal circulation), also exist and work to maintain amniotic fluid volume. These mechanisms appear to be more successful in limiting excess fluid volume than in preventing reduced fluid volume. As an example, only half of fetuses with esophageal atresia, and two-thirds of fetuses with duodenal or proximal jejunal atresia develop polyhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], whereas renal agenesis invariably results in oligohydramnios.</p><p>The physiology of normal amniotic fluid production and volume regulation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of amniotic fluid volume regulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions commonly associated with oligohydramnios are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79447 \">table 1</a>). The most likely etiologies of oligohydramnios vary according to severity and the trimester in which they are diagnosed. The majority of women with oligohydramnios or <span class=\"nowrap\">borderline/low</span> normal amniotic fluid volume present in the third trimester and have no identifiable cause. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1597700183\"><span class=\"h2\">First trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of first trimester oligohydramnios is often unclear. Reduced amniotic fluid prior to 10 weeks of gestation is rare because gestational sac fluid is primarily derived from the fetal surface of the placenta, transamniotic flow from the maternal compartment, and secretions from the surface of the body of the embryo.</p><p>Criteria suggested for determining reduced amniotic fluid at this gestational age have included a difference between mean gestational sac size (MGSS) and crown-rump length of less than 5 mm or a mean gestational sac <span class=\"nowrap\">diameter/crown-rump</span> length ratio outside the normal range for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. This finding has been associated with poor outcome in selected populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the prognostic value of these findings, when applied to large unselected populations, has not been adequately studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1597700190\"><span class=\"h2\">Second trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the beginning of the second trimester, fetal urine begins to enter the amniotic sac and the fetus begins to swallow amniotic fluid. Therefore, disorders related to the fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/urinary</span> system begin to play a prominent role in the etiology of oligohydramnios (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78227\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78227 \">table 2</a>). Maternal and placental factors, as well as rupture of the fetal membranes, are also common causes of oligohydramnios in the second trimester.</p><p>The etiologies and relative frequencies of midtrimester oligohydramnios were illustrated in a series of 128 fetuses first noted to have severe <span class=\"nowrap\">oligohydramnios/anhydramnios</span> at 13 to 24 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The following etiologies were observed: fetal anomaly (51 percent), preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) (34 percent), placental abruption (7 percent), fetal growth restriction (FGR) (5 percent), and unknown (4 percent). Six of the 65 anomalous fetuses were aneuploid. The pregnancy outcome was generally poor due to fetal or neonatal death or pregnancy termination. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.).</p><p>Oligohydramnios associated with an elevated second trimester maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) level may be caused by fetal membrane or placental damage, with leakage of amniotic fluid or fetal blood into the maternal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The fetus may or may not be anomalous. This combination (elevated MSAFP, decreased amniotic fluid volume) carries an extremely poor prognosis, including fetal growth restriction, fetal death, preterm delivery, and neonatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In one review of these cases, only 8 of 57 (14 percent) children survived past the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Second trimester oligohydramnios related to amniocentesis appears to have a better prognosis. The membranes often &quot;reseal&quot; with reaccumulation of amniotic fluid and normal pregnancy outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;, section on 'Leakage of amniotic fluid'</a>.)</p><p>There are a few reports of the occurrence and outcome of oligohydramnios after chorionic villus sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1597700197\"><span class=\"h2\">Third trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oligohydramnios first diagnosed in the third trimester is often associated with PPROM or with uteroplacental insufficiency due to conditions such as preeclampsia or other maternal vascular diseases. Oligohydramnios frequently accompanies fetal growth restriction related to uteroplacental insufficiency. Fetal anomalies and abruptio placentae also play a role at this gestational age. Amniotic fluid volume normally decreases postterm, so oligohydramnios may develop in these pregnancies. In addition, many cases of third trimester oligohydramnios are idiopathic. (Refer to individual topic reviews on these subjects).</p><p>Other mechanisms of isolated oligohydramnios may include alterations in the expression of water pores (aquaporin 1, aquaporin 3) in fetal membranes and placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>There may be an association between pregnancy during the summer season and oligohydramnios, likely related to suboptimal maternal hydration in hot weather [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2193486224\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oligohydramnios may be first suspected because the uterine size is less than expected for gestational age or because the patient presents with prelabor rupture of membranes. It may be detected on an ultrasound examination performed to assess amniotic fluid volume in a patient at risk. It also may be an incidental finding on ultrasound examination performed for another reason. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H641697213\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are both objective and subjective ultrasound criteria for diagnosis of oligohydramnios. Although use of an objective criterion is generally preferable (amniotic fluid index &le;5; single deepest pocket &lt;2 cm), subjective suspicion of amniotic fluid volume by experienced examiners has similar sensitivity for diagnosing reduced amniotic fluid volume confirmed by the dye-dilution method, the gold standard for quantifying volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>There are no large studies in women with oligohydramnios comparing the various sonographic methods of amniotic fluid volume assessment against the dye dilution method, and the latter is not useful clinically because it is invasive and time-consuming. Small series have found that objective sonographic measurements often grossly under- or over-estimated oligohydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. In the only study comparing sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging assessment of amniotic fluid volume, both modalities had similar, and relatively poor, efficacy for the detection of oligohydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1628053633\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the amniotic fluid index (AFI) for diagnosing oligohydramnios. The AFI provides a means of quantifying normal and abnormal fluid volumes and comparing assessments of amniotic fluid volumes across gestation. As the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for AFI averages approximately 7 cm throughout gestation, an AFI &le;5 cm is greater than two standard deviations below the mean value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Most studies that found significant morbidity associated with oligohydramnios used an AFI &le;5 cm as the cutoff, rather than the percentile for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Since the AFI remains relatively stable between 22 to 39 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], we feel that using the AFI cutoff &le;5 cm rather than using the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile is more clinically relevant for the diagnosis of oligohydramnios, and represents a volume that may require further assessment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical intervention. We use the term <span class=\"nowrap\">borderline/low</span> normal amniotic fluid volume to describe pregnancies with AFI &gt;5.0 and &le;8.0 cm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-amniotic-fluid-volume#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of amniotic fluid volume&quot;, section on 'Amniotic fluid index'</a>.)</p><p>A single deepest pocket (SDP) &lt;2 cm can also be used as an objective criterion for oligohydramnios. A randomized trial (SAFE) comparing AFI and SDP for prediction of adverse pregnancy outcome at term in low- and high-risk pregnancies found that use of AFI increased the frequency of diagnosis of oligohydramnios and labor induction but did not improve perinatal outcome compared with SDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-amniotic-fluid-volume#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of amniotic fluid volume&quot;, section on 'Single deepest pocket'</a>.)</p><p>Anhydramnios can be defined as the lack of a measurable AFI or SDP, although a thin echolucent rim may be imaged on the inner aspect of the uterus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1758898266\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis in multiple gestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of AFI for each sac of a multiple gestation is difficult so single deepest vertical pocket is used for diagnosis of oligohydramnios. In a twin gestation, a value &le;2 cm suggests the amniotic fluid volume is &lt;2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile and is generally accepted as diagnostic of oligohydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]; this is the same vertical pocket threshold used in singletons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTDIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our evaluation of pregnancies with oligohydramnios consists of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough maternal history and targeted physical examination is performed to look for maternal conditions that may be associated with oligohydramnios (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79447 \">table 1</a>).

In such cases, transabdominal amnioinfusion of approximately 200 milliliters of saline under ultrasound guidance can provide better visualization of fetal anatomy and thus improve diagnostic precision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. It is a reasonable option when the information obtained is likely to affect pregnancy management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A review of patients with unexplained midtrimester oligohydramnios who underwent diagnostic antenatal amnioinfusion found that the overall rate of adequate visualization of fetal structures improved from 51 to 77 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. There was also an improvement (from 12 to 31 percent) in the identification of associated anomalies in fetuses having preinfusion-identified obstructive uropathy. Other studies reported that information obtained at amnioinfusion at a median gestational age of 22 weeks led to a change of etiologic diagnosis in 13 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and the most common postamnioinfusion new findings were renal anomalies, rupture of membranes, and growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fetal magnetic resonance imaging, alone or in combination with amnioinfusion, has been used as a complementary imaging method for detecting fetal anomalies in second trimester oligohydramnios. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>To facilitate cephalic version</strong> &mdash; Decreased amniotic fluid is considered a relative contraindication to version and increases the failure rate.

Many of these women chose pregnancy termination because of the poor prognosis. Before terminating a pregnancy, parents should receive multidisciplinary counseling, when appropriate, regarding the suspected etiology of oligohydramnios, further evaluation, short- and long-term prognosis, and their options (eg, termination, continuation of pregnancy, palliative neonatal care, aggressive neonatal care). Consultation with a pediatric nephrologist is particularly important when oligohydramnios is due to renal disorders as dialysis and future renal transplant may be options in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p>Preterm delivery, either spontaneous or indicated by maternal or fetal complications, occurs in more than 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/4,14-16,41,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-16,41,56,57</a>].

Adverse outcomes are related to umbilical cord compression, uteroplacental insufficiency, and meconium aspiration. In particular, uteroplacental insufficiency and cord compression are associated with fetal heart rate abnormalities that result in cesarean delivery and low Apgar scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/12,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,58-61</a>]. The duration of oligohydramnios is also a prognostic factor.

Patients with oligohydramnios newly diagnosed in early in the third trimester may be hospitalized to undergo evaluation of possible causes (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Postdiagnostic evaluation'</a> above), daily nonstress tests, and maternal hydration in an attempt to increase amniotic fluid volume (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Maternal hydration'</a> above). In ambulatory patients, we perform a nonstress test (NST) and AFI (or biophysical profile) once or twice weekly until delivery, depending upon the maternal and fetal condition. Combined use of the NST and AFI is associated with a low rate of unexpected fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. We obtain also obtain serial sonographic examinations to monitor fetal growth. </p><p>Doppler velocimetry may have a role in identifying patients with idiopathic oligohydramnios who are at higher risk of adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In one retrospective series of 76 patients with oligohydramnios unrelated to PROM or congenital anomalies, the 46 patients with normal <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/diastolic</span> ratios demonstrated markedly reduced perinatal morbidity compared with the 30 patients with abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/diastolic</span> ratios (11 versus 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. These findings, and observations from other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], suggest that avoiding intervention in pregnancies with idiopathic oligohydramnios and normal Doppler velocimetry may decrease iatrogenic morbidity related to prematurity. Although the role of Doppler velocimetry in managing fetal growth restriction is well established, its use in other circumstances remains to be validated.

Only one small, randomized trial has evaluated outcomes with intervention versus expectant management. In this trial, 54 pregnancies beyond 40 weeks of gestation with isolated oligohydramnios were randomly assigned to either induction of labor or expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. No differences were found for any important maternal or neonatal outcome.</p><p>Observational studies have reported conflicting results. In one retrospective series, the corrected perinatal mortality rate in structurally normal fetuses with oligohydramnios was significantly lower when delivery was initiated upon diagnosis (in gestations of at least 28 weeks) than with conservative management (18 versus 90 per 1000 births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]; this suggests that intervention is indicated. However, the groups came from different institutions and time periods, so they may not have been comparable. </p><p>Most studies have reported no increased risk of fetal acidosis and generally good outcomes in pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios (AFI &lt;5 cm) in the third trimester (ie, appropriately grown nonanomalous fetus, reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, no maternal disease) when compared to controls with normal amniotic fluid volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/60,72-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,72-82</a>]. Importantly, most studies examining the benefits of AFI assessments instituted scheduled antenatal testing for these patients, suggesting that oligohydramnios may precede fetal compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Alternatively, this may be related, in part, to the low sensitivity and specificity of AFI for uteroplacental insufficiency, especially in the absence of other indicators of impaired placental perfusion, such as fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, fetal abnormalities, postterm pregnancy, or abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478820304\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our indications for delivery in patients with idiopathic oligohydramnios include, but are not limited to, nonreassuring fetal testing or reaching 37+0 to 38+6 weeks of gestation, regardless of the cervical Bishop score.

Although induction increases the risk of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/73,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,82</a>], there is insufficient evidence to assure us that perinatal outcome with continued conservative management of oligohydramnios at term is comparable to that with delivery, even in the presence of an appropriately grown, noncompromised fetus and absence of maternal disease. We do not typically confirm pulmonary maturity prior to delivery in well-dated pregnancies beyond 36 weeks. Amniocentesis can be challenging in the presence of oligohydramnios due to the lack of a fetus- or placenta-free site for needle insertion.</p><p>Alternatively, the patient can be followed with serial nonstress testing and biophysical profiles until term gestation is reached; the risks and benefits of various management plans should be discussed with the patient. </p><p>In a meta-analysis that stratified studies of women with oligohydramnios into two groups high risk (oligohydramnios plus comorbid condition) versus low risk (isolated oligohydramnios), high risk patients were more likely to have an infant with low birth weight (RR 2.35; 95% CI 1.27-4.34), but rates of 5-min Apgar score&lt;7, NICU admission, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress were similar for both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Stillbirth rates were too low to analyze. Although the authors concluded that management of patients with oligohydramnios should be dictated by the comorbid condition and not the presence of oligohydramnios alone, we believe the oligohydramnios management should be similar in both low- and high-risk pregnancies </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FETAL ASSESSMENT DURING LABOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neither AFI nor single deepest pocket performed on admission to the labor unit accurately predicts the risk of peripartum complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligohydramnios/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. We recommend obtaining a short electronic fetal heart rate recording upon admission of patients in labor to help determine whether the fetal heart rate should be monitored continuously or whether intermittent monitoring is likely to be sufficient. If the fetal heart rate is not reactive or fetal heart rate decelerations are present, then we recommend continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring during labor. We also consider transcervical amnioinfusion for patients with oligohydramnios and variable fetal heart rate decelerations in labor.

It is typically diagnosed by ultrasound examination and may be described qualitatively or quantitatively (eg, amniotic fluid index [AFI] &le;5; single deepest pocket &lt;2 cm). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions commonly associated with oligohydramnios are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79447 \">table 1</a>). The most likely etiologies of oligohydramnios vary according to the trimester in which it is diagnosed. The majority of women with oligohydramnios present in the third trimester and have no identifiable cause.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Postdiagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no effective long-term treatment of oligohydramnios. In idiopathic oligohydramnios, maternal treatment with intravenous isotonic solution, oral hydration, or amnioinfusion can lead to short-term improvement. These procedures may be useful under certain circumstances, such as to facilitate diagnostic ultrasound evaluation when the fetal anatomic survey is suboptimal. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Strategies for increasing amniotic fluid volume, when indicated'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced amniotic fluid in the first trimester appears to be an ominous finding. We counsel these patients regarding the poor prognosis, discuss the signs of miscarriage, and follow the pregnancy with serial ultrasound examinations to determine its course. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'First trimester'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis and management of second trimester oligohydramnios depend upon the underlying etiology and severity of oligohydramnios. Pregnancies with <span class=\"nowrap\">borderline/low</span> normal amniotic fluid volume generally have a good prognosis. Anhydramnios diagnosed at this time may induce anatomical and functional fetal abnormalities and often results in fetal or neonatal death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We initially perform a fetal structural survey to rule out a fetal malformation since serious abnormalities may influence future management. Serial sonographic examinations to monitor amniotic fluid volume, fetal growth, and fetal well-being are performed until delivery.
