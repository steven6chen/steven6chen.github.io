Because of the relatively benign course associated with the most common causes of pericarditis (&gt;80 percent of cases), it is not necessary to search for the etiology in all patients. As such, most patients are treated for a presumptive viral cause with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>.

In such instances, a thorough search for the etiology should be performed. To expedite the diagnostic evaluation and for symptom control, some patients may require admission to the hospital. The main causes to be ruled out include tuberculous or other bacterial forms of pericarditis, cancer (especially lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphomas and leukemias), post-cardiac injury syndromes, and systemic inflammatory diseases.

By contrast, among the patients who did not respond to aspirin after seven days, only 39 percent were deemed idiopathic, while 43 percent were diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and 18 percent with tuberculous pericarditis.

(See <a href=\"#H12602665\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114845\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114845 \">algorithm 1</a>) with acute pericarditis (eg, patients with fever, evidence of cardiac tamponade, immunosuppression, etc) should be admitted to the hospital in order to initiate appropriate therapy and expedite a thorough initial evaluation. Conversely, patients with uncomplicated (ie, low-risk) acute pericarditis can usually be evaluated and sent home, with outpatient follow-up to assess the efficacy of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3118623461\" class=\"local\">'Which patients require hospitalization?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strenuous physical activity may trigger recurrence of symptoms; therefore, such activity should be avoided until symptom resolution and normalization of biomarkers. (See <a href=\"#H2234623\" class=\"local\">'Activity restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nearly all patients with acute idiopathic or viral pericarditis, we recommend combination therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114845\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114845 \">algorithm 1</a>) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rather than NSAIDs alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). This is based upon a reduced rate of recurrent pericarditis and a low incidence of side effects with colchicine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>). We generally administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus colchicine. An acceptable alternative is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> plus colchicine in cases that are poorly responsive to ibuprofen or aspirin. (See <a href=\"#H12602672\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12602686\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two approaches to determine the duration of NSAID therapy and the proper time to begin tapering treatment, with insufficient data to recommend one approach over the other. In the first approach, the duration of treatment is based exclusively upon the resolution of symptoms, with tapering once the patient is symptom-free for at least 24 hours. In the second approach, the duration of treatment is based upon the resolution of symptoms <strong>and</strong> normalization of C-reactive protein (CRP), with the anti-inflammatory dose of NSAIDs prescribed until complete resolution of symptoms (for at least 24 hours) and normalization of CRP. (See <a href=\"#H12602672\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute pericarditis occurring within days following a myocardial infarction (MI), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>) rather than another NSAID plus colchicine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is principally due to the possibility that other NSAIDs may interfere with healing and scar formation. Although the evidence of potential harm from glucocorticoids and NSAIDs other than aspirin is modest, there is no evidence that these medications improve outcomes. For these reasons, glucocorticoids and NSAIDs other than aspirin should generally be <strong>AVOIDED</strong> in patients with acute pericarditis following an acute MI. (See <a href=\"#H12602672\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial complications of myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Management of PIP'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients considered at risk of gastrointestinal toxicity related to NSAID treatment should be treated with NSAIDs for the shortest interval possible and receive concomitant gastroprotective therapy while taking NSAIDs. Proton pump inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a>) are generally preferred for prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity due to their efficacy and favorable safety profiles. (See <a href=\"#H1410687\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal protection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids should be used for initial treatment of acute pericarditis only in patients with contraindications to NSAIDs, or for specific indications (ie, systemic inflammatory diseases, pregnancy, renal failure), and should be used at the lowest effective dose. The latter recommendation results from the greater likelihood of recurrent pericarditis when glucocorticoid therapy is used early in the course of the disease, along with a number of potentially significant side effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H12602693\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require glucocorticoid therapy for acute pericarditis, we suggest the use of moderate initial dosing (eg, 0.25 to 0.50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) followed by a slow taper rather than high doses with a rapid taper (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6865918\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to glucocorticoid dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute idiopathic or viral pericarditis have a good long-term prognosis. Both cardiac tamponade and late constrictive pericarditis rarely occur in patients with acute idiopathic pericarditis.
