It does not cure or treat the underlying kidney disease. It is intended to replace as many functions of the failing kidneys as possible. The procedure is performed at home and primarily works to remove excess fluid and waste products from the blood.</p><p>This topic discusses peritoneal dialysis. Other treatments for chronic kidney disease are discussed separately.

When these problems reach a critical stage, excess fluid and waste must be removed either by getting a kidney transplant or with kidney (renal) replacement therapy (also called dialysis).</p><p>There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplantation may be an option for some patients, although dialysis is the most commonly used treatment. The &quot;best&quot; type of dialysis depends upon your abilities, underlying medical illnesses, and personal needs. These issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It usually takes many months or years after kidney disease is first discovered before dialysis is necessary. However, some patients have a rapid decline in kidney function, and, occasionally, severe kidney failure so advanced that a patient needs to do dialysis right away is discovered for the first time in people who were not previously known to have kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>You and your doctor will decide together if dialysis would be of benefit to you and when to begin dialysis after considering a number of factors, including your kidney function (as measured by blood and urine tests), overall health, and personal preferences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Advance planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with kidney disease should discuss the possible need for dialysis early in their treatment course. Advance planning allows the clinician to choose a therapy that will best meet the patient's lifestyle and needs. In addition, if the patient and clinician decide that peritoneal dialysis would be the best current option, advance planning allows the clinician time to plan for the placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter in the abdomen.</p><p>After the catheter is placed, the patient and family will be trained by the staff at the home dialysis unit on how to set up the equipment and become familiar with the procedures used in peritoneal dialysis. During most of this &quot;training,&quot; the patient will actually be doing dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PERITONEAL DIALYSIS CATHETER INSERTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before peritoneal dialysis can begin, a catheter (thin tube) must be inserted in the abdomen to transfer fluid into and out of the abdominal cavity. The catheter is made of a soft, flexible material (usually silicone) and has cuffs (which are like Velcro), which are placed under the skin. Skin tissue grows into them to hold the catheter in place. The end of the catheter inside the abdomen has multiple holes to allow fluid to flow in and out.</p><p>The catheter exit site is typically placed to the left or right of the umbilicus (belly button), although, occasionally, the catheter exit site may be placed higher up on the abdominal wall or over your sternum. Reasons for this would vary from patient to patient and should be discussed with your doctor; the patient may be given general or local anesthesia before the insertion procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and maintenance of the peritoneal dialysis catheter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the catheter can be used right away, if dialysis is not needed, it is best to wait 10 to 14 days after placement before dialysis is performed; this allows the catheter site to heal. In some cases, a small volume of fluid can be exchanged during this time (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'How does peritoneal dialysis work?'</a> below). Your health care provider will provide more detailed instructions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PERITONEAL DIALYSIS CATHETER SITE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Care of the catheter and the skin around the catheter (called the catheter exit site) is important to keep the catheter functioning and also to minimize the risk of developing an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Care after insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the catheter is inserted, the insertion site is usually covered with a gauze dressing and tape to prevent the catheter from moving and to keep the area clean. For the first 7 to 10 days after the catheter insertion, typically nothing needs to be done to the catheter exit site. The dressing is typically left alone and usually first changed at the dialysis home training center 7 to 10 days after placement. If a dressing change is needed before this time, it should be done by a specially trained peritoneal dialysis nurse using sterile techniques. The catheter should not be moved or handled excessively, because this can increase the risk of infection.</p><p>The area should be kept dry until it is well healed, usually for 10 to 14 days. This means that you should not take a shower or bath or go swimming during this time. A washcloth or sponge may be used to clean the body, although you should be careful to keep the catheter and dressing dry. While healing (two to three weeks), you will be asked to limit lifting and vigorous exercise.</p><p>It is important to avoid becoming constipated after the catheter is inserted. Straining to move the bowels can increase the risk of developing a hernia (a weakness in the abdominal muscle). In addition, not moving the bowels regularly can lead to problems with catheter function (slow drain time or difficulty draining the abdomen completely).</p><p>To avoid constipation, your health care provider may recommend a diet that is high in fiber, as well as a stool softener or laxative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the catheter site has healed (approximately two weeks after insertion), your dialysis nurse will instruct you on catheter exit-site care. It will be important to keep the area clean to minimize the risk of skin infection, as well as infection inside the abdomen (called peritonitis). In addition, most centers will recommend that you &quot;anchor&quot; the catheter with tape to stabilize the catheter and minimize the chance of movement causing some injury to the healed exit site.</p><p>The skin around the catheter site should be washed daily or every other day with antibacterial soap or an antiseptic (either povidone iodine or chlorhexidine). The soap should be stored in the original bottle (not poured into another container). Other types of cleansers, such as hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, should <strong>NOT</strong> be used unless directed by a health care provider.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before cleaning the area, wash your hands with soap and water and put on clean gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the catheter still during cleaning, which helps prevent injury to the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not pick at or remove crusts or scabs at the site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pat the skin around the site dry after cleaning. A clean cloth or towel is suggested.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply a prescription antibiotic cream to the skin around the catheter with a cotton-tip swab every time the dressing is changed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using tapes or dressings that prevent air from reaching the skin. The site should be covered with a sterile gauze dressing, which should be changed every time the site is cleaned. The catheter should be anchored to the skin with tape or a specially designed adhesive.</p><p/><p>With appropriate catheter placement and exit-site care, most peritoneal dialysis catheters are problem free and work for many years. If the catheter no longer works or is needed, a minor surgical procedure is required to remove it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the first two weeks, the skin around the catheter should not be red or painful. The skin should feel soft. There may be a small amount of thick, yellow mucus discharge around the catheter. A crust or scab may form every few days.</p><p>If the skin is reddened, painful, firm, or there is pus-like discharge around the catheter, there may be an infection. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal dialysis complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Care after injury to the catheter site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is an injury to the catheter site, such as an accidental pull on the catheter, or if the catheter is moved excessively, a short course of oral antibiotics may be recommended to prevent infection from developing inside the abdomen (peritonitis). Most dialysis units recommend that you call if you injure the catheter site to determine if further evaluation or treatment is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DOES PERITONEAL DIALYSIS WORK?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid (called dialysate) is infused into the abdominal cavity (called the peritoneal cavity) through the patient's catheter. The fluid is held (dwells) within the abdomen for a prescribed period of time; this is called a dwell. The lining of the abdomen (the peritoneum) acts as a membrane to allow excess fluids and waste products to pass from the bloodstream into the dialysate.</p><p>When the dwell is completed, the &quot;used&quot; dialysate can then be drained out of the abdomen (called an exchange) into a sterile container or into a shower or bathtub. This used fluid contains the excess fluid and waste that has been removed from the blood that was normally eliminated in the urine. The peritoneal cavity is then filled again with fresh dialysate, and the process starts again.</p><p>The process may be done manually four to five times during the day by infusing the fluid into the abdomen and later allowing it to run out by gravity. The process of connecting the bag of new dialysis fluid, emptying, and filling for each exchange takes 30 to 40 minutes when done manually. The exchange may also be done using a machine (called a cycler). This is what most patients do. In this case, the fluid exchanges are done automatically while the patient sleeps, and, because the person's catheter is already connected to the machine by a long tube, each exchange takes less time.</p><p>At times when the abdomen is full of dialysate, you may have a feeling of fullness or bloating, although you should not feel pain. However, most patients have no abnormal sensations, and, despite the fluid in the abdomen, most people do not look or feel any different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different types of peritoneal dialysis schedules are possible. The &quot;right&quot; type of peritoneal dialysis depends upon an individual's situation. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Which type is right for me?'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) involves multiple exchanges during the day (usually three) with an overnight dwell. A machine is not needed, and the person can walk around while the fluid is in the abdomen. At bedtime, dialysate is infused and is drained upon awakening. Occasionally, a machine (called a cycler) will be needed to perform an exchange one or more times while sleeping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) is an automated form of peritoneal dialysis (APD) in which a machine performs exchanges while the patient sleeps; there may be a long daytime dwell and, occasionally, a manual daytime exchange. Once the person awakes, they disconnect the catheter from the machine. When awake, just as with CAPD, the person can walk around while the fluid is in the abdomen. In developed countries such as the United States, CCPD is performed more commonly than CAPD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Which type is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are often allowed to choose between CAPD and CCPD or APD based upon lifestyle or personal issues. CCPD or APD allows significantly more uninterrupted daytime for work, family, and social activities than CAPD.</p><p>There may be changes in treatment type, dwell time, number of exchanges, or type of dialysate after beginning treatment based upon how the body responds. Periodic blood and urine tests, as well as tests of the used dialysate, are used to fine tune peritoneal dialysis treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PERITONEAL DIALYSIS COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most serious complications of peritoneal dialysis is infection, which can develop in the skin around the catheter or inside the abdominal cavity (called peritonitis). Another potential, but less serious, complication of peritoneal dialysis is the development of a hernia, a weakness in the abdominal muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter-site infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs of catheter-site infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, firmness, or tenderness of the skin around the catheter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pus-like drainage from the area</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritonitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritonitis is the term used to describe an infection of the abdominal cavity. People who use peritoneal dialysis are at risk of peritonitis because bacteria can enter the abdomen through or around the peritoneal dialysis catheter. These infections can usually be treated at home and resolve completely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Left untreated, peritonitis can become a life-threatening infection. Signs of peritonitis may include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain, which may be mild to severe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cloudy used dialysate fluid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature greater than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there are any signs of infection, you need to be seen by a health care provider and begin treatment as soon as possible. The type of treatment used depends upon the severity and location of the infection. Peritoneal dialysis is usually continued as the infection is being treated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter-site infections are often treated with an antibiotic cream <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral antibiotics, as well as more frequent skin cleaning. Most mild infections resolve with treatment within one to two weeks. If the infection does not resolve, the catheter may need to be removed and replaced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal catheter exit-site and tunnel infections in peritoneal dialysis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonitis usually resolves with treatment, and the patient continues on their usual dialysis therapy. Treatment typically requires one or more antibiotics, which are commonly given through the person's catheter with the dialysis fluid (dialysate) (eg, intraperitoneal dosing). A change in the dwell time <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dialysis prescription is sometimes needed temporarily. Less commonly, the peritoneal dialysis catheter must be removed to cure the peritonitis. In these cases, the person will be transitioned to hemodialysis and, once the infection resolves, if clinically indicated, often can have another catheter placed and return to peritoneal dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-therapy-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and therapy of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hernia is the medical term for a weakness in the abdominal muscle. People who use peritoneal dialysis are at risk of developing a hernia for several reasons, including the increased stress on the muscles of the abdomen (as a result of the weight of the dialysate) and the opening in the abdominal muscle created by the peritoneal dialysis catheter. Hernias can develop near the belly button (umbilical hernia), in the groin (inguinal hernia), or near the catheter site (incisional hernia).</p><p>Signs of a hernia include painless swelling or new lump in the groin or abdomen. If you develop signs of a hernia, contact your health care provider but continue to perform peritoneal dialysis regularly. Treatment of a hernia generally involves surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hernias-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hernias in continuous peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVING WITH PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic kidney disease is a lifelong condition that requires lifelong treatment. Peritoneal dialysis is one option for lifelong treatment, with other options including hemodialysis and kidney transplantation. It is sometimes necessary to switch from one form of treatment to another as circumstances change.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet &ndash; People who undergo dialysis, both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, are often required to make changes to their diet. In general, people who use peritoneal dialysis have a less restricted diet compared with those who use standard in-center hemodialysis. Dietary changes help to ensure that the body has an adequate, but not excessive, amount of protein and certain minerals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">People who use peritoneal dialysis lose protein with every exchange, which usually means that they must eat an increased amount of protein in the diet. Protein is found in meat, milk, chicken, fish, and eggs; lower-quality protein is found in some vegetables and grains. A dietitian can provide specific recommendations about how much and what type of protein is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other changes in diet may include reducing the amount of foods eaten that contain phosphorus (found in dairy products, cheese, dried beans, liver, nuts, and chocolate) and sodium and monitoring the amount of fluids consumed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight gain &ndash; Weight gain can be a problem for people undergoing peritoneal dialysis because the dialysate contains a high concentration of dextrose, a type of sugar. The body absorbs some of this dextrose during the dwell, which can lead to weight gain. A dietitian can provide guidance on how to minimize weight gain by monitoring the number of calories eaten.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body image &ndash; The abdomen may enlarge slightly and may cause you to feel bloated when it is filled with fluid. You may need a larger size of clothing and see a physical difference when dressed. Some people have a hard time accepting the change in their appearance. Patient support groups and websites can provide reassurance and tips for dressing. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activities and peritoneal dialysis &ndash; In general, people using peritoneal dialysis should limit physical activities when their peritoneal cavity is full (has a large-volume dwell). It is still possible to exercise and participate in sports, although you should discuss your activities with your clinicians.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time requirements &ndash; Peritoneal dialysis requires time and dedication, potentially interfering with other activities. This is especially true with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), which requires the person to perform several exchanges during the daytime. Although it is possible to work and be active while using peritoneal dialysis, it may be necessary to cut back on responsibilities.</p><p/><p>It is important to perform every exchange and dwell exactly as recommended. Skipping a treatment or performing a dwell for shorter or longer than recommended may increase the risk of illness and the chances of being hospitalized and can even shorten the person's life.</p><p>If the demands of peritoneal dialysis feel overwhelming or if you are having trouble performing all the necessary treatments, talk to a health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4426\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
