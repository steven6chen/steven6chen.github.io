Compared to nondiabetic patients, patients with diabetes are more likely to have CHD, which is most often multivessel, and to have episodes of silent ischemia. As a result of these and other factors, diabetic patients with CHD have a lower long-term survival rate than nondiabetic patients with CHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with diabetes comprise as many as 25 to 30 percent of those who undergo revascularization. Outcome data from large registries and subgroup analyses of randomized trials of patients undergoing revascularization are available to guide management decision making. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes after PCI'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes after CABG'</a> below.)</p><p>The medical and revascularization management of CHD, including the indications for revascularization, are generally similar in patients with and without diabetes. However, the short- and long-term results of revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery are often worse in diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-revascularization-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus-and-multivessel-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes compared to patients without diabetes'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will focus on the approach to revascularization in patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease. The approach to revascularization in diabetic patients with left main or lesser degrees of coronary disease is similar to the broad population of patients and is discussed in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of left main coronary artery disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues related to medical versus interventional therapy for stable angina in nondiabetic patients and to silent ischemia are discussed separately.

Our recommendations for revascularization in the broad population of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) are discussed separately.

The best available evidence regarding the optimal strategy for these patients comes from the BARI 2D trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-revascularization-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus-and-multivessel-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In BARI 2D, 2368 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable ischemic heart disease (defined as either a &ge;50 percent stenosis of a major epicardial coronary artery associated with a positive stress test or &ge;70 percent stenosis and classic angina) were enrolled. Prior to randomization to either revascularization (either coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG] or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) with intensive medical therapy (IMT) within four weeks or to IMT, patients were chosen to be placed in either the CABG or PCI stratum based on individual physician&rsquo;s preference. </p><p>At five years, the primary end points of the rates of survival or freedom from major cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction [MI], or stroke) did not differ significantly between the revascularization group and the IMT alone group (88.3 versus 87.8 percent and 77.2 versus 75.9 percent, respectively). However, in sub-group analysis, the rate of freedom from major cardiovascular events was significantly higher in the CABG plus IMT stratum compared to the corresponding IMT stratum (77.6 versus 69.5 percent), predominantly attributable to a reduction in nonfatal MI. The rates for this end point were not significantly different between the PCI stratum and the corresponding IMT group (77.0 versus 78.9 percent, respectively).</p><p>This sub-group observation was further evaluated in an analysis of the prespecified secondary end points of cardiac death and MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-revascularization-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus-and-multivessel-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Five-year cardiac mortality did not differ significantly between revascularization (PCI and CABG) with IMT and IMT (5.9 versus 5.7 percent, respectively). In the PCI stratum (n = 1605), there were no significant differences in the rates of cardiac death or MI between PCI with IMT compared to IMT alone. However, in the CABG stratum (n = 768), MI occurred significantly less frequently with revascularization plus IMT compared to IMT alone (10 versus 17.6 percent), as did the composite end point of cardiac death and MI (15.8 versus 21.9 percent). The investigators postulated that the lower event rate in the CABG plus IMT stratum was due to a preference for CABG, rather than PCI, in patients with more extensive disease. </p><p>In an attempt to understand further which patients might benefit from CABG, a risk score was developed from baseline angiographic (myocardial jeopardy index, total number of coronary lesions, prior coronary revascularization, and left ventricular ejection fraction) and clinical variables (Framingham Risk Score) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-revascularization-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus-and-multivessel-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients were then stratified into high- and low-risk subgroups using either angiographic or clinical variables or both. The end point of interest was the combination of death, MI, and stroke. The following findings were noted at five years:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients selected for CABG, compared to those selected for PCI, had higher angiographic and clinical risk scores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant difference in the composite end point between the IMT and combined coronary revascularization group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The composite end point occurred significantly less often in the CABG stratum than in the IMT group (24.8 versus 36.8 percent) among those in the highest angiographic risk tertile and this effect was even more pronounced in patients with both high angiographic and high clinical risk (27.1 versus 47.3 percent; hazard ratio 2.10, p = 0.0051).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no significant differences in all other treatment group comparisons, including lower risk CABG groups and all PCI groups; in this comparison, risk was determined using a combined angiographic and clinical score. The event rates in the low-risk PCI stratum, high-risk PCI stratum, and low-risk CABG stratum, all compared to IMT, were 18.7 versus 18.5, 34.2 versus 34.8, and 17.0 versus 19.9 percent. </p><p/><p>Although this study suggests that in patients with diabetes only those at high angiographic and clinical risk benefit from revascularization with CABG, the analysis is limited by small sample size in subgroups and lack of validation of the angiographic risk score used.</p><p>A second randomization within BARI 2D, comparing a strategy of insulin sensitization to insulin provision, is discussed separately.

High sensitivity troponin T was measured at baseline in all patients and was detectable in 99.6 percent. Patients were grouped according to whether their value was normal (&lt;14 ng per liter) or abnormal (&ge;14 ng per liter), with 14 ng per liter being the reference limit above which definite myocardial necrosis is present. The five-year rate of the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke was 27.1 percent among the patients who had abnormal troponin T concentrations at baseline, as compared with 12.9 percent among those who had had normal baseline troponin T concentrations. Among 2277 individuals with a detectable level of troponin T at baseline, there was no difference between the revascularization and intensive medical therapy strategies in the two troponin groups (hazard ratio 0.96 for both troponin groups). </p><p>We do not recommend measurement of troponin in patients with SIHD and diabetes nor do we recommend prophylactic revascularization in very high-risk patients with an abnormal value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITHOUT DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes after revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) are often worse in diabetic compared to nondiabetic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">With PCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who undergo elective PCI, the procedural success rates are similar in patients with and without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-revascularization-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus-and-multivessel-coronary-artery-disease/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].
