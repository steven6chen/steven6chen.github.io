It may occur at term (&ge;37 weeks of gestation) or preterm (&lt;37 weeks of gestation); the latter is designated preterm PROM (PPROM). Midtrimester PROM typically refers to PPROM at 16 to 26 weeks of gestation; this is an arbitrary definition, which varies slightly among investigators. The frequencies of term, preterm, and midtrimester PROM are approximately 8, 3, and &lt;1 percent of pregnancies, respectively. Why membranes rupture at term and whether different etiologies account for prelabor versus intrapartum membrane rupture is not well understood. </p><p>The management of term PROM will be reviewed here. Issues regarding midtrimester PROM and PPROM are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prelabor rupture of membranes before and at the limit of viability&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with term PROM should be evaluated by a clinician. Whether the patient should be evaluated immediately or can remain at home for a few hours to see if labor begins has not been studied extensively. In the absence of high-quality data supporting the safety of delaying evaluation, the most prudent approach is prompt assessment to confirm membrane rupture, determine fetal position, evaluate maternal and fetal status, and discuss options for further management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PROM is based upon a characteristic history (ie, leaking fluid per vagina) and confirmatory speculum examination in which fluid is seen flowing from the cervical os. If the diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic testing is performed on fluid in the posterior fornix. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PROM are the same across gestation and are discussed in detail separately.

We suggest prompt delivery for women with term PROM. Labor is induced as soon as possible, unless there are contraindications to labor or vaginal delivery, in which case cesarean delivery is performed as soon as possible. </p><p>Our approach is based primarily on our concern about the increased risks of maternal and newborn infection with expectant management, as well as our patients&rsquo; general preference for expedited delivery. Prompt intervention also reduces the risk of other serious but less common complications during expectant management, such as cord prolapse or abruption, and was the most cost-effective approach in one model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, labor tends to be longer with induction than when labor begins spontaneously. </p><p>For women who decline prompt intervention, a time limit for expectant management is developed through shared decision-making (see <a href=\"#H884259\" class=\"local\">'Duration of expectant management'</a> below). Signs of infection or other pregnancy complications are an indication for termination of expectant management and delivery by the most appropriate method for the clinical situation.</p><p>Our approach is supported by a 2017 systematic review of 23 randomized trials of women with PROM at &ge;37 weeks of gestation that compared pregnancy outcome of planned early intervention versus expectant management (n = 8615 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Compared with expectant management, planned early intervention resulted in a reduction in time from membrane rupture to birth (mean difference -10 hours, 95% CI -12 to -8 hours) and: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in maternal chorioamnionitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endometritis <span class=\"nowrap\">(54/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">110/1000;</span> relative risk [RR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.72)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in admission to a neonatal special care or intensive care unit (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.85)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No increase in cesarean delivery <span class=\"nowrap\">(126/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">150/1000;</span> RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69-1.04) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonstatistical reductions in definite early onset neonatal sepsis <span class=\"nowrap\">(12/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">22/1000;</span> RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.24-1.33) and perinatal mortality <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">2/1000;</span> RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.13-1.66)</p><p/><p>The lack of statistical difference in definite neonatal sepsis rates between expectant and active&nbsp;management was likely due to inadequate sample size (low power), given that the composite &quot;definite or probably early onset neonatal sepsis&quot; was significantly reduced in the planned early intervention group (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.92).&nbsp;Even a small increase in risk of neonatal infection is important because, if severe (ie, sepsis), there is a small (&lt;5 percent) risk of death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-sepsis-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of sepsis in term and late preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Outcome'</a>.)</p><p>The authors judged the quality of the trials, and evidence is low overall. The findings of the meta-analysis were limited by heterogeneity among trials such that planned early intervention was defined as implemented (or intended to be implemented) within 24 hours of randomization, whereas expectant management was defined as an intended delay of at least 24 hours. Furthermore, there was no consistent use of antibiotic prophylaxis or method of induction (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>, various types of prostaglandins). The results were also dominated by one large trial from the termPROM study group that included over 5000 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and comprised 60 percent of the total number of participants included in the review. Thus, well-designed randomized trials are still needed to better define the balance between the risks and benefits of induction versus expectant management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882368\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3190629261\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxytocin induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with no contraindications to labor and vaginal delivery, we suggest induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>, without preinduction cervical ripening.

Only a few small trials have evaluated preinduction cervical ripening in women with term PROM and an unfavorable cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], so the absence of statistical benefit in these trials does not negate the possibility of a modest clinical effect, as observed in populations with intact membranes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction&quot;</a>.) </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> (prostaglandin E1) is an effective method of labor induction.

Meconium stained amniotic fluid has been associated with an increased risk of clinical chorioamnionitis and positive amniotic fluid cultures, nonreassuring intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns, and meconium aspiration syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. However, there is no evidence that immediate induction of labor will reduce the risk of these complications; therefore, we believe amniotic fluid lightly stained with meconium is not a strong contraindication to expectant management if antepartum fetal assessment is otherwise reassuring (reactive nonstress test with no variable decelerations). In some of these cases, meconium-like staining is actually pigment associated with decidual hemorrhage. In contrast and in the absence of data from randomized trials to guide practice recommendations, we believe induction and continuous fetal monitoring are prudent when meconium is thick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H884259\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of expectant management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no strong data on which to base a recommendation for the maximum duration of expectant management in women with no pregnancy complications warranting delivery. In the termPROM study, which limited expectant management to 96 hours post rupture, the risk of chorioamnionitis appeared to increase significantly after 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], suggesting that 24 hours is a reasonable limit. Waiting up to 36 hours would allow many women to labor spontaneously. In the termPROM study, 50 percent of women with PROM managed expectantly delivered within 33 hours, and 95 percent delivered within 94 to 107 hours of membrane rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Expectant management in hospital or at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest hospitalizing women with PROM.

In multiple logistic regression analyses, women managed at home had a higher risk of infection in their newborns (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% CI 1.00-3.90) and nulliparas managed at home were at increased risk of receiving antibiotics before delivery (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.04-2.24).

(See <a href=\"#H2673277385\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p>We believe use of prophylactic antibiotics for&nbsp;PROM&nbsp;at or near&nbsp;term&nbsp;should be avoided, given the unmeasured potential adverse effects of antibiotic use, the potential for development of resistant organisms, and the low risk of maternal infection in untreated patients. There is no convincing evidence of maternal or neonatal benefit from use of prophylactic antibiotics for&nbsp;PROM&nbsp;at or near&nbsp;term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In a 2015 meta-analysis of five trials involving a total of 2699 women, compared with placebo or no treatment, use of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics resulted in no statistical reductions in chorioamnionitis (2.7 versus 3.7 percent), endometritis (0.4 versus 0.9 percent), or latency from PROM to delivery (mean difference 0.5 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. No statistical difference in neonatal sepsis (1 versus 1.4 percent) or perinatal death (0.6 versus 0.3 percent) was observed, but a clinically significant difference cannot be excluded given the small number of these events. In the 37 percent of pregnancies in which latency was longer than 12 hours, subgroup analysis revealed a lower rate of maternal infection with antibiotic prophylaxis, but no statistical improvement in neonatal outcomes. No data were available on potential harms. </p><p>The relative risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis are different preterm. Available evidence, although limited, supports the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in preterm PROM (PPROM) because it prolongs latency, which is desirable in preterm gestations but not a goal in term PROM.

It occurs in 8 percent of pregnancies at term. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of all term pregnancies in which PROM is suspected should include confirmation of membrane rupture and assessment of maternal and fetal well-being. The need for group B streptococcal chemoprophylaxis should also be determined. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest prompt induction of labor in women with term PROM (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Compared with expectant management, induction of labor is associated with a reduction in maternal and possibly neonatal infection and lower treatment costs, with no increase in cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Active or expectant management?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Oxytocin is as effective as prostaglandins, is easier to titrate, and may be less expensive, depending on the preparation. Data supporting the safety of balloon catheter use for cervical ripening in PROM are sparse. (See <a href=\"#H882368\" class=\"local\">'Active management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-prelabor-rupture-of-the-fetal-membranes-at-term/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gafni A, Goeree R, Myhr TL, et al.
