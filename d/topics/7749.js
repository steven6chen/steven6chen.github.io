ETT typically presents as a discrete, hemorrhagic, solid, and cystic lesion that is located either in the fundus, lower uterine segment, or endocervix. Like PSTT, it forms tumor nodules in the myometrium. Microscopically, the tumor is composed of a relatively uniform population of mononucleate intermediate trophoblastic cells forming nests and solid masses.

GTN may follow a molar pregnancy (complete or partial) or any other pregnancy event (miscarriage, induced abortion, preterm or term pregnancy). </p><p>GTN most commonly presents following evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole, with the following characteristics: pre-evacuation uterine size is larger than gestational age and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level &gt;100,000 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. Bilateral ovarian enlargement is frequently present when the hCG level is markedly elevated. Signs suggestive of GTN after complete molar pregnancy are an enlarged uterus, abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), and persistent bilateral enlarged ovaries. Rarely, a metastatic nodule will be present in the vagina, which can bleed vigorously, particularly if biopsied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>In contrast, clinical signs and symptoms of GTN following a partial hydatidiform mole include persistent AUB and a boggy, but not significantly enlarged uterus, without evidence of bilateral enlarged ovaries. Metastatic disease is rare after partial mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification/abstract/14,15,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,36</a>].</p><p>GTN following a term or preterm gestation may present with amenorrhea, but usually presents with AUB due to invasion of uterine tumor or bleeding from a metastatic site. Bleeding from uterine perforation or metastatic lesions may result in abdominal pain, hemoptysis, or melena. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases often exhibit evidence of increased intracranial pressure from intracerebral hemorrhage, leading to headaches, dizziness, seizures, or hemiplegia. Patients who develop extensive pulmonary metastases may present with dyspnea, cough, or chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Rapid growth, widespread dissemination, and a high propensity for hemorrhage makes this tumor a medical emergency. </p><p>Placental site trophoblastic tumors (PSTT) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ETT) almost always cause irregular bleeding or amenorrhea, frequently long after the antecedent pregnancy. There are rare reported cases of nephrotic syndrome and virilizing syndrome associated with these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification/abstract/17,27,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27,37</a>]. Following a nonmolar antecedent pregnancy, choriocarcinoma is the most common histopathologic type of GTN that develops. Choriocarcinoma may present with non-specific signs and symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult. This frequently accounts for a delay in diagnosis, which often adversely affects prognosis. Patients who develop rising hCG values following a nonmolar pregnancy should be considered to have choriocarcinoma until proven otherwise. However, serum hCG levels are routinely monitored in women who have a previous molar pregnancy, but not in other women (except following ectopic pregnancies). Thus, a persistently elevated hCG does not generally come to medical attention unless it is measured to evaluate symptoms (eg, AUB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Any reproductive-age woman with unexplained persistently elevated or rising hCG levels should be considered to potentially have GTN. Other sources of persistent levels of hCG should be excluded, such as normal pregnancy, pituitary hCG, phantom hCG, and ectopic hCG production from other tumors.

The occurrence of persistent but falling hCG levels six months after molar evacuation was reported in 76 (0.5 percent) of 13,960 patients and in 96 (0.8 percent) of 12,526 patients. Spontaneous hCG remission was observed in 66 (87 percent) and 65 (80.2 percent) patients followed with expectant management.

For this reason, women who develop GTN after a nonmolar pregnancy typically undergo evaluation with serum hCG and ultrasound only after they become symptomatic.

This is sufficient for diagnosis even if there is no uterine enlargement and no evidence of metastatic disease. It is critical to exclude a normal viable pregnancy and abnormal pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy), ectopic hCG production by a nontrophoblastic tumor, or other causes of persistent low-level hCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Biopsies should <strong>not</strong> be performed because GTN lesions are highly vascular and may cause vigorous bleeding. Thus, hemorrhage is common, particularly from the uterus due to repeated trauma by dilation and curettage. Life-threatening hemorrhage may necessitate embolization or resection of the affected organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

In these patients, a uterine curettage may be performed and the diagnosis can be confirmed based upon the pathology evaluation of the curettage specimen. (See <a href=\"#H248937987\" class=\"local\">'Uterine curettage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Following a nonmolar pregnancy, the most common histologic type of GTN is choriocarcinoma, and this should be presumed to be the diagnosis, unless proven otherwise.

The key issue is to determine whether the antecedent pregnancy was a molar pregnancy or nonmolar pregnancy, and when that pregnancy terminated. Following a molar pregnancy, the diagnosis of GTN is usually clearly established by doing weekly human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) monitoring. Following a nonmolar pregnancy, however, the differential diagnosis of GTN is more challenging. Pregnancy or other sources of hCG must be excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydatidiform mole: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The obstetric differential diagnosis of elevated hCG includes normal pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and ectopic pregnancy.

GTN is comprised of the following histologic types: invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT). (See <a href=\"#H118448\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 percent of cases of GTN arise from molar pregnancy, 25 percent from miscarriages or tubal pregnancy, and 25 percent from term or preterm pregnancy. The estimated incidence of GTN after a term pregnancy is 1 per 150,000 pregnancies and after a spontaneous miscarriage is 1 in 15,000 pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H334199126\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main risk factors for the development of GTN are prior molar pregnancy, advanced maternal age (&gt;40 years), and Asian and American Indian ancestry. (See <a href=\"#H334199843\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presenting symptoms and signs of GTN depend upon whether the antecedent pregnancy was molar or nonmolar. The clinical presentation may include: elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), hyperthyroidism, ovarian theca lutein cysts, abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain or pressure, or symptoms of metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H14900557\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The key elements of the diagnostic evaluation are to confirm an elevated hCG and evaluate for metastatic disease or hCG stimulation effects. The vagina and lungs are the most common metastatic sites. Uterine curettage or other biopsies have a limited role in the diagnosis of GTN. (See <a href=\"#H248937909\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H248939887\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic sites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should have a chest imaging to evaluate for lung metastases. We suggest a chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96988\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96988 \">image 1</a>) rather than chest computed tomography (CT). A chest radiograph, not CT, is the basis for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging, and additional findings on CT do not typically contribute to treatment planning.
