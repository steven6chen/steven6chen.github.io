Reliable identification of ESBL-producing organisms in clinical laboratories can be challenging, so their prevalence is likely underestimated. Carbapenems are the best antimicrobial agent for infections caused by such organisms.</p><p>The types and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases as well as the epidemiology and treatment of organisms that produce them are discussed in this topic. The clinical features and diagnosis of the infections that ESBL-producing organisms often cause are discussed elsewhere.

The first plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria was discovered in Greece in the 1960s. It was named TEM after the patient from whom it was isolated (Temoniera) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Subsequently, a closely related enzyme was discovered and named TEM-2. It was identical in biochemical properties to the more common TEM-1 but differed by a single amino acid with a resulting change in the isoelectric point of the enzyme.</p><p>These two enzymes are the most common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>. TEM-1 and TEM-2 hydrolyze penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalosporins, such as cephalothin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>. However, they are not effective against higher generation cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>. Consequently, when these antibiotics were first introduced, they were effective against a broad group of otherwise resistant bacteria. A related but less common enzyme was termed SHV, because sulfhydryl reagents had a variable effect on substrate specificity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalosporins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cephalosporins&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTENDED-SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not long after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> came into clinical use in Europe, strains of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> were discovered in Germany with transferable resistance to the oxyimino-cephalosporins (eg, cefotaxime, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The enzyme responsible was related to SHV and was named SHV-2. TEM-related extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were discovered in France in 1984 and in the United States in 1988.</p><p>The ESBL family is heterogeneous. SHV and TEM-type ESBLs arose by amino acid substitutions that allowed narrower spectrum enzymes to attack the new oxyimino-beta-lactams. Others, notably members of the CTX-M family, represent plasmid acquisition of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases originally determined by chromosomal genes.</p><p>ESBLs vary in activity against different oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates but cannot attack the cephamycins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a> and cefmetazole) and the carbapenems (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a>). They are also generally susceptible to beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam, which consequently can be combined with a beta-lactam substrate to test for the presence of this resistance mechanism.</p><p>ESBLs have been found exclusively in gram-negative organisms, primarily in <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Klebsiella oxytoca</em>, and <em>Escherichia coli</em> but also in <em>Acinetobacter</em>, <em>Burkholderia</em>, <em>Citrobacter</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em>, <em>Morganella</em>, <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, and <em>Shigella</em> spp.</p><p>Infection due to ESBL-producing <em>E. coli</em> has become widespread in hospitals around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Community-associated infection due to ESBL has also been recognized as an important clinical problem in the United States and Europe. In addition, a substantial portion of community-onset infection due to ESBL-producing <em>E. coli</em> has been observed among patients with no discernible health care-associated risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">ESBL varieties</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2046954083\"><span class=\"h3\">TEM beta-lactamases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The amino acid substitutions responsible for the ESBL phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently more than 220 TEM-type enzymes have been described. Not all behave as ESBL, and some, such as TEM-1 and TEM-2, only hydrolyze beta-lactams such as penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nevertheless, most are ESBLs, some are resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors, and a few are both ESBLs and inhibitor-resistant. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">SHV beta-lactamases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 190 SHV varieties are known, and they are found worldwide. SHV-2, SHV-5, SHV-7, and SHV-12 are among the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Not all the SHVs are ESBL and some, such as SHV-1, only hydrolyze beta-lactams such as penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62299411\"><span class=\"h3\">CTX-M beta-lactamases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These enzymes were named for their greater activity against <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>). Despite their name, a few are more active on ceftazidime than cefotaxime. Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally found on the chromosome of <em>Kluyvera</em> species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. </p><p>More than 160 CTX-M enzymes have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They have been found in many different Enterobacteriaceae including <em>Salmonella</em>, are the most common ESBL type worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and are increasingly prevalent in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The proliferation of CTX-M enzymes is due not to being better beta-lactamases than TEM or SHV varieties but to the capture and dissemination of CTX-M genes by mobile genetic elements that mediate rapid and efficient spread between replicons and from cell to cell, especially to highly successful lineages such as <em>E. coli</em> ST131 and ST405 and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> CC11 and ST147 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">OXA beta-lactamases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OXA beta-lactamases were long recognized as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> isolates from Turkey and France. OXA beta-lactamases with carbapenemase activity have also been described. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carbapenemase-producing-gram-negative-bacilli#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli&quot;, section on 'Class D beta-lactamases'</a>.)</p><p>Not all OXA enzymes are ESBLs, and certain ones only hydrolyze beta-lactams such as penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and narrow spectrum cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1535778883\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other plasmid-mediated ESBL families, such as PER, VEB, and GES, have been described but are uncommon and have been found mainly in <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and at a limited number of geographic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition to conferring high-level resistance to antipseudomonal beta-lactams, these ESBLs also degrade cephalosporins, and monobactams. Other rare ESBLs found in Enterobacteriaceae are BES, SFO, and TLA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of antimicrobial therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is based upon the resistance they confer to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>) and the ability of a beta-lactamase inhibitor, usually clavulanate, to block this resistance. Other enzymes have different features that can be misleading in the laboratory. AmpC-type beta-lactamases, which are now determined by plasmid as well as chromosomal genes, can provide oxyimino-beta-lactam resistance, but they are resistant to inhibition by clavulanate and usually confer resistance to cephamycins (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a>, and cefmetazole), which ESBLs do not.</p><p>Problems in identification arise because ESBLs are heterogeneous. OXA-type ESBLs, for example, are poorly inhibited by clavulanate. Some ESBLs are best detected with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> and others with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> (such as most CTX-M enzymes). Consequently, susceptibility to several oxyimino-beta-lactams must be tested; criteria for ESBL detection have changed over time; and clinical laboratories vary in their success in diagnosis.</p><p>Previously, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommended screening isolates of <em>E. coli</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, <em>K. oxytoca</em>, or <em>Proteus mirabilis</em> by disk diffusion or broth dilution for resistance, followed by a confirmatory test for increased susceptibility in the presence of clavulanate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In 2010, however, the CLSI published new minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion breakpoints for the Enterobacteriaceae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The new MIC breakpoints are one to three doubling dilutions lower than the original breakpoints, and the new disk diffusion criteria include larger zone diameters than those in previous guidelines. In 2010, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) similarly changed the breakpoint criteria for susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, many organisms that previously would have been categorized as susceptible using the former breakpoints may now be considered intermediate or resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Whether the evidence for these new breakpoints is sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and if they eliminate the need to perform ESBL screening and confirmatory tests for making treatment decisions is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While the disk diffusion breakpoints can be implemented immediately, there are barriers to immediate implementation of the new MIC breakpoints; clinicians should review local practices with their own microbiology laboratories.</p><p>Nonetheless, ESBL testing may be performed for infection control purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

CTX-M-15 was the most common ESBL identified, followed by SHV- and TEM-type enzymes. Two or more &beta;-lactamase genes were identified in 63 percent of the isolates, including non-ESBLs and carbapenemases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rates of ESBLs have also been increasing in the US, as reflected by a study that reported an increase in the incidence of ESBL-producing infections in southeastern US hospitals from 11.1 to 22.1 infections per 100,000 patient days between 2009 and 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ESBL prevalence is even higher in isolates from Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], reaching 60 percent in <em>K. pneumoniae</em> isolates from Argentina and 48 percent in <em>E. coli</em> isolates from Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing community-acquired ESBL infections led to the discovery of concomitant high and increasing rates of fecal colonization by ESBL-producing bacteria worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p>Children are also increasingly affected by ESBL-producing organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Outbreaks have been due both to a single ESBL-producing strain and to a single ESBL plasmid carried by unrelated strains. A resistant strain or plasmid may cause problems in several hospitals locally or involve a large geographic area. Community clinics and nursing homes have also been identified as potential reservoirs for ESBL-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em> and <em>E. coli</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18777551\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ESBL-producing organisms are a growing cause of nosocomial infections and outbreaks as well as community-acquired infections, data on the actual risk of transmission of ESBLs within and outside the hospital setting are limited.</p><p>In one observational study from a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland, active surveillance cultures for ESBL carriage were performed in patients who shared a hospital room for at least 24 hours (contact patients, n = 133) with patients found to be infected or colonized with an ESBL-producing organism (index patients, n = 93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Only seven contacts (5.3 percent) were found to be colonized with an ESBL-producing organism, and only two harbored a strain that was genetically identical to that in the index patient, suggesting a low overall transmission rate (1.5 percent). </p><p>A study from a separate tertiary care hospital in Switzerland reported slightly higher in-hospital transmission rates of 4.5 percent for ESBL-producing <em>E. coli</em> (4 of 88 contacts exposed to 40 index patients) and 8.3 percent for ESBL-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em> (2 of 24 contacts exposed to 8 index patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

As mentioned above, mortality rates of 3.7 percent have been described with carbapenems, with much higher mortality rates with antibiotics not active against these organisms (7 of 11 [64 percent]) and with cephalosporin monotherapy or a <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactam/beta-lactamase</span> inhibitor combination such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (4 of 9 [44 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>In one predictive model for mortality among patients with bloodstream infections with ESBL-producing organisms, factors with a major impact on mortality include age older than 50 years, infection due to <em>Klebsiella</em> spp, source other than urinary tract, fatal underlying disease, Pitt score &gt;3, severe sepsis or septic shock at presentation, and inappropriate empirical antibiotic choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Some individuals infected or colonized by ESBL-producing organisms continue to shed bacteria for prolonged periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Among 42 patients with infection due to ESBL-producing <em>E. coli</em>, persistent colonization was observed after a median of 58 months among five patients. It is unclear whether systemic antibiotic therapy affects colonization status. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION CONTROL AND ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other clonal outbreaks caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods, interventions aimed at controlling the horizontal spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms should target the transmission pathways within the hospital. Two main strategies to control outbreaks due to ESBL-producing bacteria have been described: barrier protection of infected or colonized patients (contact precautions), and restriction of beta-lactam use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/97,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,102</a>]. The optimal implementation of contact precautions is uncertain. We agree with guidelines from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology that recommend contact precautions for the duration of the hospitalization during which ESBL infection or colonization was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Discontinuation of inpatient contact precautions can be considered once six months have passed since the last positive culture, the patient does not have an active infection and is not on active treatment of an ESBL infection, and at least two consecutive negative rectal swabs at least one week apart, off antibiotics, have been obtained. </p><p>Institution of both barrier protection and restriction of cephalosporin use in one study was associated with a decrease in the number of infections caused by ESBL-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em> (4.9 episodes to 0.6 episodes per 1000 patient-days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In a 2017 meta-analysis, antimicrobial stewardship programs reduced the incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization and infection by 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. The institution of barrier methods without antibiotic restriction has also been evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/31,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,105</a>]. All personnel in contact with patients infected with or carriers of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were required to use gowns and gloves. In one study, barrier production was associated with a decrease in the incidence of hospital-acquired ESBL from 172 patients to 19 over three years, despite increased use of cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. </p><p>A subsequent study modeled the impact of improved hand hygiene, patient cohorting, and antibiotic restrictions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Improving hand hygiene compliance from 60 to 80 percent would be associated with a 91 percent reduction in colonization with ESBL-producing gram-negative rods at 90 days. Cohorting patients would be associated with a further 7 percent decrease in colonization rates. However, antibiotic restriction would not affect colonization rates.</p><p>Since there are environmental reservoirs for resistant gram-negative organisms (eg, sink pipes), ensuring the cleanliness of medical equipment and patient care areas are also important measures for prevention and reduction of healthcare-associated infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-general-principles#H362418550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: General principles&quot;, section on 'Cleaning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20111524\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that inactivate and confer resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and the monobactam <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>. They are found exclusively in gram-negative organisms, primarily <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Klebsiella oxytoca</em>, and <em>Escherichia coli</em>. Many different varieties of ESBL exist. They differ in their activity against particular beta-lactam substrates and in their geographical distribution. Most ESBLs do not break down cephamycins or carbapenems and are susceptible to beta-lactamase inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory detection of an ESBL in an organism is based on resistance to particular cephalosporins and the ability of a beta-lactamase inhibitor to block this resistance. However, the heterogeneity of the ESBL varieties can make identification difficult. Thus, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute has adjusted susceptibility breakpoint recommendations for gram-negative bacilli. As a result, many organisms that previously would have been categorized as susceptible using the former breakpoints may now be considered intermediate or resistant. This often precludes the need to identify the ESBL in order to make treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ESBL-producing gram-negative bacilli have been reported worldwide. They are most often isolated from hospitalized patients but are an increasing cause of community-acquired infections. Risk factors for infection include prior administration of an antibiotic, presence of urinary or vascular catheters, and longer hospital or ICU stays. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best therapeutic option for severe infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms is a carbapenem (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a>). We use meropenem or imipenem for most ESBL infections. Ertapenem is an acceptable option in the absence of resistance or severe sepsis and can be particularly useful in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Carbapenems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefepime</a> may be effective against ESBL-producing organisms that test susceptible if administered in high doses (ie, 2 g every eight hours). Use of other cephalosporins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> has been associated with treatment failures. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftolozane-and-tazobactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ceftolozane-tazobactam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-and-avibactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime-avibactam</a> combinations appear promising, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy relative to carbapenems. There is little clinical evidence for cephamycin use, which has been associated with development of resistance. Resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones is also common in these organisms. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections with ESBL-producing organisms are associated with higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays, greater hospital expenses, and reduced rates of clinical and microbiologic response compared with similar infections with gram-negative bacteria that do not produce ESBL. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Clinical outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spread of ESBL-producing organisms within institutions can be slowed by the use of barrier protection and restriction of later generation cephalosporins.
