Many heart transplant recipients had atherosclerotic heart disease as the etiology for heart failure and were often hyperlipidemic prior to transplantation, occasionally from genetic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

Mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR inhibitors) often cause hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p/><p>Some patients, especially those with heart failure due to nonischemic causes such as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, have a normal lipid profile prior to transplantation. De novo hyperlipidemia in these patients most often begins at two weeks and stabilizes three months after transplant unless there is further weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A similar increase in lipid levels can occur in those with pre-existing hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Additional factors that contribute to post cardiac (or renal) transplant hyperlipidemia are male gender and renal insufficiency (which may be a pre-existing condition or may develop after transplantation as a result of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> therapy). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steroids are thought to play a major role in early post-transplant hyperlipidemia. They may act by leading sequentially to peripheral insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. The steroid-induced reduction in corticotropin (ACTH) release also may contribute to the lipid abnormalities. In one report, the administration of ACTH for three weeks to nine hyperlipidemic. steroid-treated patients (five of whom were transplant recipients) led to substantial reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, and an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. ACTH may act in part by upregulating LDL receptor activity.</p><p>Several studies have documented the importance of corticosteroids, which is usually a function of the total steroid exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. In one study of renal transplant recipients, for example, steroid withdrawal was associated with a 17 percent reduction in total cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A similar effect has been noted in heart transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. One study compared 117 cardiac transplant recipients, 56 percent of whom were maintained of steroid-free immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mean serum cholesterol concentration during follow-up was 21 to 26 percent lower in those who did not receive steroids (average 205 versus 267 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.3 versus 6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p>The net benefit of steroid withdrawal on atherosclerosis risk is uncertain. Although the fall in total cholesterol should be beneficial, it is associated with a proportionate and undesirable reduction in HDL cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcineurin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential importance of the calcineurin inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> on lipid metabolism was illustrated by a study in renal transplant recipients in whom the total cholesterol level was 30 to 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.77 to 0.92 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> higher in patients treated with triple therapy including cyclosporine than in those receiving only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Cyclosporine may also raise the serum concentration of Lp(a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The effect of cyclosporine appears to be dose-dependent, since there is a rough correlation between blood cyclosporine levels and the degree of hypercholesterolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>How the lipid changes occur is incompletely understood. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> is lipophilic and is transported in the blood in the core of LDL and HDL particles. It is possible, for example, that the alteration in LDL in some way interferes with its removal from the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The effect of FK506 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) on lipid metabolism is similar to that of cyclosporine, although the rise in total cholesterol levels may be less pronounced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Studies in renal transplant recipients are compatible with the importance of corticosteroids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.
