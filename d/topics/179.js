Injury to or loss of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, in the absence of infiltrative disease of the bone marrow, is the major pathophysiologic characteristic of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, bone marrow failure is a more encompassing term that describes pancytopenia from a variety of different mechanisms, including bone marrow replacement by tumor or fibrosis, disordered cellular maturation (eg, vitamin B12 deficiency), and myelodysplasia, in which the stem cells are malignant and may be present in increased numbers but do not mature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52354 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In either condition, the associated neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can lead to potentially life-threatening infections and bleeding, respectively.</p><p>Acquired AA, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow in the absence of abnormal infiltrates and without increased reticulin, accounts for most cases of AA in children and young adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 2</a>). Acquired AA in children and young adults will be reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Aplastic anemia in adults is reviewed separately.

The major identifiable etiologies are exposure to a wide variety of drugs and chemicals, ionizing radiation, and some viruses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 2</a>). AA may also rarely complicate orthotopic liver transplantation; AA in this setting has a very poor outcome except in those patients who develop the disorder in the context of fulminant hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis'</a> below.) AA also has occurred in patients with other immune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and, occasionally, in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>In one study of 213 children &lt;17 years of age with acquired severe AA (SAA) or very severe AA (vSAA) who underwent treatment with hematopoietic cell transplantation or immunosuppression, the following etiologies were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of severity'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic &ndash; 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-hepatitis &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-viral infection &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs, other toxins &ndash; 4 percent</p><p/><p>The incidence of AA is reported to be triphasic, with small peaks at two to five years (due to inherited causes) and 20 to 25 years, with the majority of patients presenting beyond 55 to 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in three case series, the median age at diagnosis of children with AA was between eight and nine years of age, suggesting an additional peak later in the first decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>]. The incidence of acquired AA in Europe and North America is estimated at two per million population per year with higher rates in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to large doses of external radiation produces dose-dependent acute hematopoietic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The presumed mechanism is direct radiation injury to the stem cells. Whole body exposure to 3.5 to 5.5 Gy is associated with a 50 percent mortality; doses higher than this produce irreversible marrow damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53570 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>With the exception of nuclear reactor accidents, there appears to be little role for occupational radiation or background environmental exposure as a risk factor for AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Aplasia caused by phenylbutazone usually occurs after prolonged treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Similarly, gold-induced aplasia typically occurs in patients who have received a total dose of 200 to 450 mg; it is usually severe and often irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felbamate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Felbamate</a>, an antiepileptic medication, has been associated with numerous cases of AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Cytotoxic drugs used in the treatment of malignancy can kill stem cells directly, resulting in aplasia.

Prolonged exposure to benzene is particularly notorious in this regard; in the past, this condition occurred primarily in poorly ventilated rubber factories and shoe shops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The insecticide benzene hexachloride (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lindane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lindane</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>A reduced ability to detoxify environmental toxins may play a role in the genesis of AA. Two studies have shown that the incidence of gene deletions for glutathione S-transferase, an enzyme involved in detoxifying potentially mutagenic electrophilic compounds, was significantly higher in patients with acquired AA and myelodysplastic syndromes than in healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

The best documented virus is parvovirus B19. This agent more commonly attacks proerythroblasts and causes transient red cell aplasia, as seen in patients with chronic hemolytic anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-pure-red-cell-aplasia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired pure red cell aplasia in the adult&quot;</a>.)

Hepatitis may account for 2 to 5 percent of cases of AA in western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. The responsible virus has not been identified; hepatitis A, B, C, and G do not appear to be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Notably, up to 15 percent of patients with seronegative acute liver failure will develop AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The mechanism may involve T cell activation with release of cytokines. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Immune system'</a> below.)</p><p>A study from Japan collected 61 cases of hepatitis-associated AA (HAA) out of a total of 525 children with acquired AA (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Of 49 patients with viral studies, hepatitis A, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were detected in one case each; no patient had hepatitis B. Seventeen of 20 patients with HAA underwent successful hematopoietic cell transplantation, and were alive at a median follow-up of 66 months, while 28 of 41 were alive following treatment with immunosuppressive agents, with an actuarial survival rate of 61 percent at seven years.</p><p>Five of 30 patients with severe AA due to hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive therapy developed either myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), similar to the 15 percent incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> in their patients with severe idiopathic AA. Actuarial survivals at 10 years for the patients with severe HAA and severe idiopathic AA were similar at 60 and 56 percent, respectively.</p><p>Another study of 44 children with hepatitis associated AA treated with immunosuppressive therapy reported a similar overall response rate of 70 percent, with overall survival at 10 years at 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

As described below, immune system abnormalities and genetic predisposition may play causative roles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two major observations are consistent with the immune system playing a major role in the destruction of stem cells in AA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of these patients respond to immunosuppressive therapy (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoreactive T-lymphocytes from the bone marrow of patients with AA can inhibit hematopoiesis when cocultured with patient or normal marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,38</a>]. This inhibition may be mediated by the release of marrow-suppressing cytokines, such as interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-2. IFN-gamma gene expression is specifically prevalent in the bone marrow of patients with acquired AA, and disappears with response to immunosuppression.</p><p/><p>In one report, IFN-gamma gene expression was present in the bone marrow of 14 of 17 patients with severe AA, four of seven with moderate aplasia, and none of 39 with other hematologic disorders, including chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia or marrow failure caused by other disorders such as the myelodysplastic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another study suggested that overexpression of TNF affected stem cells by promoting differentiation rather than self-renewal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>These observations have led to a unifying hypothesis for AA that damage induced by chemicals, drugs, viruses, or antigens leads to lymphocyte activation, which produces a hematopoietic inhibitory response, perhaps mediated by IFN-gamma or by the cytokine cascade released by IFN-gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41</a>]. IFN-gamma, in turn, may lead to increased expression of the Fas receptor. This receptor is involved in induction of apoptosis and in T cell mediated killing; it is found in increased concentration in CD34+ bone marrow cells in patients with AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic role</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several findings suggest that genetic mechanisms have a role in the evolution of AA.

Nonresponders to repeat therapy have a worse outcome (49 versus 86 percent actuarial survival in responders in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other than relapse, late complications following successful immunosuppressive therapy include evolution of clonal disease such as MDS and AML. The reported rate of these disorders has ranged from 9 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] to 19 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. One retrospective study from Japan identified absent response to immunotherapy at six months and &ge;120 days of treatment with G-CSF as significant risk factors for the future development of MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. On univariate analysis, the relative risks for development of MDS were 5.4 (95% CI 1.9-15) for no response at six months, and 4.4 (95% CI 1.3-15) for &ge;120 days of treatment with G-CSF. These observations have not yet been confirmed by others. In addition to finding an increased risk of relapse, the NIH study found on multivariate analysis that shorter telomere length was associated with a higher probability of clonal evolution [24.5 percent for patients in the first quartile (95% CI 8.7-37.5) and 8.4 percent for patients in quartiles 2 through 4 (95% CI 3.2-13.3)] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifteen to 33 percent of patients with AA treated with immunotherapy recover, with clonal evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and clinical manifestations that may be mild, transient, or progress to full-blown disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].

In more than 70 percent of children with acquired AA, no clear cause can be determined. Identifiable etiologies include radiation exposure, drugs and chemicals, and infectious agents, usually viruses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 2</a>). Acquired AA can be seen following viral hepatitis and during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of AA is variable and is related to the degree of cytopenia present. This includes bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia, fatigue and pallor due to anemia, and fever and bacterial infections resulting from neutropenia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AA is suggested by a complete blood count revealing pancytopenia and is confirmed by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy demonstrating hypocellularity of all three cell lines. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical outcome of patients with acquired AA is dependent upon the severity of the pancytopenia. Patients with severe and very severe disease have a 70 percent mortality rate within one year if not successfully treated. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe and very severe acquired AA, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from an HLA-matched sibling donor is the treatment of choice. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for aplastic anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an HLA-matched sibling donor is not available for patients with severe and very severe acquired AA, we recommend intensive immunosuppressive therapy over the use of matched unrelated, mismatched related, or mismatched unrelated HCT. The current regimen that we recommend includes antithymocyte globulin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and short-term use of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.
