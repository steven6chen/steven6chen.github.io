The clinical features of tetanus and its relationship to traumatic injuries were well known among the ancient Greeks and Egyptians and to many clinicians before the introduction of vaccination with tetanus toxoid in the 1940s. The term &quot;lockjaw&quot; (now called trismus) lives in modern parlance as a reminder of one of the cardinal features of tetanus: intense, painful spasms of the masseter muscles.</p><p>Tetanus can present in one of four clinical patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cephalic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal</p><p/><p>Although tetanus is now rare in the developed world, the disease remains a threat to all unvaccinated people, particularly in developing countries. Since <em>C. tetani</em> spores cannot be eliminated from the environment, immunization and proper treatment of wounds and traumatic injuries are crucial for tetanus prevention. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of tetanus will be reviewed here. The principles of prevention of tetanus and management of tetanus-prone wounds are discussed separately.

During the period between 2001 and 2008, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there were 233 cases of tetanus in the United States, with an annual incidence of 0.10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million</span> population overall and 0.23 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million</span> among individuals &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The case-fatality rate was 13.2 percent overall but was 31.3 percent among individuals &ge;65 years of age. In 2009, 19 cases of tetanus and 2 deaths were reported in the United States through the national tetanus surveillance system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Most patients with tetanus lack a history of receipt of a full series of tetanus toxoid immunization and receive inadequate prophylaxis following a wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. Approximately three-fourths of patients who acquired tetanus in the United States between 2001 and 2008 recalled an acute injury prior to the onset of their symptoms, but approximately two-thirds of these individuals did not seek medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among 51 patients who sought care for an acute wound and had a sufficiently thorough surveillance report to allow evaluation, 49 (96 percent) did not receive adequate tetanus toxoid prophylaxis or tetanus toxoid prophylaxis plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetanus immune globulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, occasional patients with preexisting antitetanus antibodies (as measured by guinea pig or mouse protection assays) have developed tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-immunization-in-infants-and-children-0-through-6-years-of-age#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in infants and children 0 through 6 years of age&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-immunization-in-children-7-through-18-years-of-age#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in children 7 through 18 years of age&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>Unlike in developing nations, neonatal tetanus is extremely rare in the United States. Only one case of neonatal tetanus was reported between 2001 and 2008; this case occurred in an infant whose mother had not been vaccinated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Fifteen percent of patients with tetanus had diabetes mellitus, which is three times the estimated prevalence of diabetes in the United States. Another 15 percent of patients were injection drug users.</p><p>The annual incidence of tetanus in other developed countries is also low and declining due to vaccination programs. In England and Wales, for example, the annual incidence was 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million</span> population, with the highest incidence in patients above the age of 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Italy reported the highest number of cases among the countries of Europe, but the annual incidence decreased from 0.5 to 0.2 per 100,000 from the 1970s to the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The case-fatality ratio decreased from 68 to 39 percent over that same period; women &gt;64 years of age were disproportionately affected.</p><p>Despite the low rate of clinical disease in developed countries, many adults are inadequately vaccinated against tetanus. In the serologic survey cited above in the United States between 1988 and 1994, protective levels of antitetanus antibody (&gt;0.15 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> were present in 72 percent of individuals &ge;6 years of age but only 31 percent of adults over the age of 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Not surprisingly, protective antibody levels are more likely in adults with a history of military service, higher levels of education, and higher incomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Developing countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with developed nations where tetanus is rare, tetanus remains endemic in the developing world, and the incidence often increases following natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Approximately one million cases of tetanus are estimated to occur worldwide each year, with 300,000 to 500,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In 2002, tetanus caused an estimated 180,000 deaths worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among patients admitted for neurologic conditions to one hospital in Nigeria, tetanus was the second most common cause (14 percent) after stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Case-fatality rates in developing countries remain high and have not changed significantly in the past several decades. The pooled fatality rate of 3043 adult African patients reported in 27 studies was 43 percent (95% CI 37 to 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The high fatality rate likely reflects the fact that mechanical ventilation is often not available in African medical facilities. Longer incubation periods were associated with lower fatality rates.</p><p>Neonatal tetanus, which the World Health Organization targeted for elimination by 1995, accounted for approximately 59,000 deaths in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While this represents a decrease in mortality of 92 percent compared with 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], as of 2014, 24 countries had still not eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal tetanus'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus occurs when spores of <em>Clostridium tetani</em>, an obligate anaerobe normally present in the gut of mammals and widely found in soil, gains access to damaged human tissue. After inoculation, <em>C. tetani</em> transforms into a vegetative rod-shaped bacterium and produces the metalloprotease tetanospasmin (also known as tetanus toxin).</p><p>After reaching the spinal cord and brainstem via retrograde axonal transport within the motor neuron, tetanus toxin is secreted and enters adjacent inhibitory interneurons, where it blocks neurotransmission by its cleaving action on the membrane proteins involved in neuroexocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. The net effect is inactivation of inhibitory neurotransmission that normally modulates anterior horn cells and muscle contraction. This loss of inhibition (ie, disinhibition) of anterior horn cells and autonomic neurons results in increased muscle tone, painful spasms, and widespread autonomic instability.</p><p>Muscular rigidity in tetanus occurs though a complex mechanism that involves an increase in the resting firing rate of disinhibited motor neurons and lack of inhibition of reflex motor responses to afferent sensory stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Lack of neural control of adrenal release of catecholamines induced by tetanus toxin produces a hypersympathetic state that manifests as sweating, tachycardia, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Generalized tetanus'</a> below.)</p><p>Tetanus toxin-induced effects on anterior horns cells, the brainstem, and autonomic neurons are long lasting because recovery requires the growth of new axonal nerve terminals. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Duration of illness'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanisms of binding to and inhibition of neural cells are related to specific portions of the tetanospasmin (tetanus toxin) molecule. Tetanus toxin is produced initially as an inactive polypeptide chain by actively growing organisms. This synthesis is controlled by genes located in an intracellular plasmid.</p><p>After death of the clostridial bacterium, the toxin is released and then activated by bacterial or tissue proteases into its active form, which contains a heavy chain necessary for binding and entry into neurons and a light chain responsible for its toxic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/16,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-22</a>]. Heavy chains are further cleaved by pepsins into specific fragments, which individually mediate binding to specific types of neural cells. Presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release is mediated via light chains.</p><p>Tetanolysin is another toxin produced by <em>C. tetani</em> during its early growth phase. It has hemolytic properties and causes membrane damage in other cells, but its role in clinical tetanus is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because <em>C. tetani</em> will not grow in healthy tissues, a convergence of factors must be present in order for tetanus toxin to be elaborated in the human host. This combination of factors usually includes absence of antibodies (ie, from inadequate vaccination) plus two or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A penetrating injury resulting in the inoculation of <em>C. tetani</em> spores</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coinfection with other bacteria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devitalized tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A foreign body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized ischemia</p><p/><p>The above factors explain why tetanus-prone injuries include splinters and other puncture wounds, gunshot wounds, compound fractures, burns, and unsterile intramuscular or subcutaneous injections (that often occur in injection drug users). These predisposing factors can also explain why tetanus can develop in unusual clinical settings such as in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates (due to infection of the umbilical stump)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetric patients (after septic abortions)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postsurgical patients (with necrotic infections involving bowel flora)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents and adults undergoing male circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with dental infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic patients with infected extremity ulcers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who inject illicit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contaminated drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus in patients without an identifiable cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An identifiable antecedent cause for tetanus is obvious in more than 90 percent of patients presenting with tetanus, but no cause can be identified in a small percentage of patients with classic signs and symptoms of tetanus. Presumably, minor unnoticed abrasions or skin injuries are responsible for most or all of these &quot;cryptogenic&quot; cases. Tetanus has occurred rarely in patients who have received a timely and correct series of tetanus immunizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period of tetanus is approximately 8 days but ranges from 3 to 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The incubation period is typically shorter in neonatal tetanus than in non-neonatal tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal tetanus'</a> below.)</p><p>Inoculation of spores in body locations distant from the central nervous system (eg, the hands or feet) results in a longer incubation period than inoculation close to the central nervous system (eg, the head or neck).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized tetanus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common and severe clinical form of tetanus is generalized tetanus. The presenting symptom in more than half of such patients is trismus (lockjaw), although patients with generalized tetanus sometimes present with cephalic or localized tetanus. Patients with generalized tetanus typically have symptoms of autonomic overactivity that may manifest in the early phases as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. In later phases of illness, profuse sweating, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension or hypotension, and fever are often present.</p><p>Patients with tetanus may develop reflex spasms of their masseter muscles rather than a (normal) gag response when their posterior pharynx is touched with a tongue blade or spatula (the spatula test). In one study of 400 consecutive patients with suspected tetanus, the sensitivity and specificity of this maneuver were high (94 and 100 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This test may even be useful in infants, but it is not useful when patients have severe trismus.</p><p>Patients with generalized tetanus characteristically have tonic contraction of their skeletal muscles and intermittent intense muscular spasms. Since patients with tetanus have no impairment of consciousness or awareness, both the tonic contractions and spasms are intensely painful. Tetanic spasms may be triggered by loud noises or other sensory stimuli such as physical contact or light. Tonic and periodic spastic muscular contractions are responsible for most of the classic clinical findings of tetanus such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opisthotonus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risus sardonicus (sardonic smile)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A board-like rigid abdomen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periods of apnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper airway obstruction due to vise-like contraction of the thoracic muscles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glottal or pharyngeal muscle contraction, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia</p><p/><p>During generalized tetanic spasms, patients characteristically clench their fists, arch their back, and flex and abduct their arms while extending their legs, often becoming apneic during these dramatic postures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Local tetanus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, tetanus presents with tonic and spastic muscle contractions in one extremity or body region. Local tetanus often but not invariably evolves into generalized tetanus. Diagnosis in local tetanus can be difficult. For example, rarely patients with early tetanus may develop board-like abdominal rigidity that mimics an acute surgical abdomen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cephalic tetanus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with injuries to the head or neck may present with cephalic tetanus, involving initially only cranial nerves. Like other forms of local tetanus, patients with cephalic tetanus often subsequently develop generalized tetanus. Prior to the appearance of the typical features of generalized tetanus, patients with cephalic tetanus may manifest confusing clinical findings including dysphagia, trismus, and focal cranial neuropathies that can lead to a misdiagnosis of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The facial nerve is most commonly in cephalic tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but involvement of cranial nerves VI, III, IV, and XII may also occur either alone or in combination with others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal tetanus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal tetanus occurs as a result of the failure to use aseptic techniques in managing the umbilical stump in offspring of mothers who are poorly immunized. The application of unconventional substances to the umbilical stump (eg, ghee or clarified butter, juices, and cow dung) have been implicated as common cultural practices that contribute to neonatal tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Neonatal tetanus can also result from unclean hands and instruments or contamination by dirt, straw, or other nonsterile materials in the delivery field.</p><p>Neonatal tetanus typically occurs in infants 5 to 7 days following birth (range 3 to 24 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The onset of illness is typically more rapid in neonatal tetanus than in older individuals and may progress over hours rather than days, probably because axonal length is proportionately shorter in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Neonatal tetanus presents with refusal to feed and difficulty opening the mouth due to trismus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Sucking then stops and facial muscles spasm, which may result in risus sardonicus (sardonic smile). The hands are often clenched, the feet become dorsiflexed, and muscle tone increases. As the disease progresses, neonates become rigid and opisthotonus (spasm of spinal extensors) develops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity of illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity and frequency of the clinical features of tetanus may vary from case to case, depending upon the amount of tetanus toxin that reaches the central nervous system. Symptoms and signs may progress for up to two weeks after the disease onset. The severity is related to the incubation period of the illness and the interval from the onset of symptoms to the appearance of spasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; the longer the interval, the milder the clinical features of tetanus. In addition, illness may be milder in patients with preexisting but nonprotective levels of antitetanus antibodies. In one study of 64 patients with tetanus, serum obtained prior to the institution of treatment contained detectable levels of antibody in 35 percent of patients, and the severity of tetanus in these patients appeared to be inversely related to the level of pretreatment antitetanus toxin antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus toxin-induced effects are long lasting because recovery requires the growth of new axonal nerve terminals. The usual duration of clinical tetanus is four to six weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of tetanus is usually obvious and can generally be made based upon typical clinical findings outlined above. Tetanus should especially be suspected when there is a history of an antecedent tetanus-prone injury and a history of inadequate immunization for tetanus. However, tetanus can sometimes be confused with other processes, as discussed in the following section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1917381\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus can sometimes be confused with the following mimics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-induced dystonias such as those due to phenothiazines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-induced dystonias often produce pronounced deviation of the eyes, writhing movements of the head and neck, and an absence of tonic muscular contraction between spasms. By contrast, tetanus does not produce eye deviations, and the muscles are characteristic tonically contracted between spasms. Finally, administration of an anticholinergic agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a> mesylate will usually immediately reverse the spasms seen in drug-induced dystonias. Such therapy has no effect on patients with tetanus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Trismus due to dental infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental infections may produce trismus that may rarely be confused with cephalic forms of tetanus. However, the presence of an obvious dental abscess and the lack of progression or superimposed spasms usually make the distinction between the two diseases apparent after initial evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a period of observation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications, diagnosis, and treatment of odontogenic infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Strychnine poisoning due to ingestion of rat poison</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accidental or intentional strychnine poisoning may produce a clinical syndrome similar to tetanus. Supportive care for both conditions is critical; thus, the initial treatment of both conditions is identical. Assays of blood, urine, and tissue for strychnine can be performed in special reference laboratories. Such tests should be obtained when there is any suspicion of accidental or intentional poisoning or when a typical history of an antecedent injury or infection for tetanus is lacking or the patient has been adequately immunized for tetanus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strychnine-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strychnine poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant neuroleptic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with malignant neuroleptic syndrome can present with striking symptoms of autonomic instability and muscular rigidity. However, the presence of fever, altered mental status, and recent receipt of an agent with a propensity to cause this complication usually makes the distinction from tetanus relatively easy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Stiff-person syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by severe muscle rigidity. Spasms of the trunk and limbs may be precipitated by voluntary movements or auditory, tactile, or emotional stimulation, all of which can also occur in tetanus. The absence of trismus or facial spasms and rapid response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> distinguish SPS from true tetanic spasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

However, it is important to emphasize that appropriate antimicrobial therapy may fail to eradicate <em>C. tetani</em> unless adequate wound debridement is performed. This was illustrated by one study in which 45 isolates of <em>C. tetani</em> were obtained at the time of wound debridement from 84 Vietnamese patients with severe tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The use of passive immunization to neutralize unbound toxin is associated with improved survival, and it is considered to be standard treatment.</p><p>In the United States, human <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetanus immune globulin</a> (HTIG) should be readily available and is the preparation of choice. A dose of 3000 to 6000 units intramuscularly should be given as soon as the diagnosis of tetanus is considered, with part of the dose infiltrated around the wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. HTIG should be administered at different sites than tetanus toxoid.</p><p>Intrathecal administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetanus immune globulin</a> is of unproven benefit. A randomized trial from Brazil compared intramuscular plus intrathecal administration of immunoglobulin (n = 58) with intramuscular therapy alone (n = 62) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The patients receiving intrathecal therapy had a shorter duration of spasms, shorter hospital stay, and a decreased requirement for respiratory assistance. Mortality was not significantly affected.</p><p>However, a number of methodologic issues might have affected this study. The mortality rate for tetanus patients fell during the study period from 35 percent in historical controls to 12 percent among control patients in this study. While tetanus cases were graded upon admission, these grades were not reported, and the only note of more patients with grade III and IV disease among the controls compared with those receiving intrathecal immunoglobulin implies that these differences arose during the course of therapy. The investigators refer to tetanus hyperimmune globulin but merely list a lyophilized human immunoglobulin in the methods section.</p><p>In countries in which HTIG is not readily available, equine antitoxin is used intramuscularly or intravenously. When equine antitoxin is used, an intradermal test dose of 0.1 mL in a 1:10 dilution should be administered prior to giving the full dose in order to evaluate for hypersensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, antecedent skin testing is not needed if a human preparation is to be used.</p><p>Infiltration of antitoxin, either human or equine, into the wound has sometimes been advocated but is of unproven value. The use of pooled intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) has been proposed as a possible alternative to HTIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Active immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since tetanus is one of the few bacterial diseases that does not confer immunity following recovery from acute illness, <strong>all</strong> patients with tetanus should receive active immunization with a total of three doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid spaced at least two weeks apart, commencing immediately upon diagnosis. Tetanus toxoid should be administered at a different site than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetanus immune globulin</a>. It should be assumed that anyone who is not adequately vaccinated or protected against tetanus is also inadequately protected against diphtheria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) may be used instead of Td but, if used, recommendations are for this formulation to be used only once in adults, except in pregnant women, who should receive Tdap during each pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].

Several drugs may be used to control these spasms. Attention to placement of the patient and control of light or noise in the room in an effort to avoid provoking muscle spasms was an important component of care for patients with tetanus in the past before the availability of drugs to prevent spasms. These measures are still vital in regions where the availability of neuromuscular blocking agents may be limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Benzodiazepines and other sedatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines have been used traditionally and are generally effective in controlling the rigidity and spasms associated with tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. They also provide a sedative effect. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diazepam</a> has been used most frequently, but other benzodiazepines are as effective as diazepam. Patients with tetanus often show tolerance to the sedating effects of benzodiazepines and may remain awake and alert after receiving doses that would sedate or cause anesthesia in other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>For tetanus, the usual starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> for an adult is 10 to 30 mg IV and repeated as needed every 1 to 4 hours; total daily doses as high as 500 mg may be required for an adult. Ventilatory assistance is imperative at these higher doses. When higher doses of the IV formulation of diazepam are used, the vehicle, propylene glycol, may produce hyperosmolarity and an anion gap metabolic (lactic) acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These abnormalities are often accompanied by acute kidney injury and can progress to multisystem organ failure. To avoid these problems when high doses of a benzodiazepine are required, a continuous infusion of IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> can be given as it does not contain propylene glycol. For patients who are absorbing drugs well by the enteral route, diazepam can be given enterally via a feeding tube. Since these drugs may be required for a prolonged period of time (often weeks), they should be tapered gradually to avoid withdrawal reactions.</p><p>The properties, usual dosing regimens for sedation, and adverse effects of benzodiazepines are discussed in greater detail separately.

When intensive care units (ICUs) are not available, acute respiratory failure is a leading cause of death from tetanus.

Since <em>Clostridium tetani</em> spores cannot be eliminated from the environment, immunization and proper treatment of wounds and traumatic injuries are crucial for tetanus prevention. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus is a clinical diagnosis and must be considered in patients with muscle spasms and an inadequate vaccination history. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care is the mainstay of management to avoid complications such as respiratory failure, nosocomial infections, and thromboembolism. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the disease is mediated by a toxin, a crucial aspect of therapy is to eliminate ongoing toxin production, neutralize unbound toxin usually with human <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetanus immune globulin</a>, and immunize against tetanus since natural disease does not confer immunity. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobials play an adjunctive role in the therapy of tetanus. We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (500 mg intravenously every six to eight hours) for the treatment of tetanus. We suggest a treatment duration of 7 to 10 days. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle spasms are controlled with sedation (usually benzodiazepines) or neuromuscular blockade. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Control of muscle spasms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic hyperactivity can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> sulfate. Beta blockade without concomitant alpha blockade should be avoided. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> for both autonomic dysfunction and additional control of muscle spasms has generated considerable interest. This drug is readily available and is used worldwide for the treatment of eclampsia. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Management of autonomic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with shorter incubation periods have increased disease severity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus prophylaxis following a puncture wound is discussed in detail separately. The following table summarizes the approach to tetanus prophylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds#H505135015\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of puncture wounds&quot;, section on 'Tetanus immunization'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunization of women who are pregnant or of childbearing age dramatically reduces neonatal tetanus mortality. Improving hygiene during home births in the developing world is also likely to play an important role in preventing neonatal tetanus. (See <a href=\"#H1917252\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
