A local recurrence is defined as reappearance of cancer on the ipsilateral chest wall. In contrast, a regional recurrence denotes tumor involving the regional lymph nodes, usually ipsilateral axillary or supraclavicular, less commonly infraclavicular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> internal mammary nodes.</p><p>Treatment has the potential to provide long-term disease control for patients who develop an isolated locoregional recurrence after mastectomy. However, the management of these patients is complex and usually requires multidisciplinary assessment and planning.</p><p>The management of a locoregional recurrence after mastectomy for operable breast cancer will be reviewed here. The management of a local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is discussed elsewhere.

The risk of a postmastectomy locoregional recurrence is slightly lower than that after breast-conserving therapy (BCT, 10 to 15 percent), although it is much higher in women who undergo breast-conserving surgery without radiation therapy (RT).

Thirty to 40 percent have a local plus regional recurrence in the supraclavicular, axillary, or internal mammary nodes, with the supraclavicular nodes being the most common site. This distribution may change with the more widespread use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy.</p><p>There is wide variability in the reported incidence of simultaneous locoregional and distant metastases (10 to 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/2,5,6,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,13-16</a>]. However, it is generally thought that approximately one-third of patients who present with a postmastectomy locoregional recurrence have synchronous distant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In modern randomized trials, rates of locoregional recurrence in women receiving postmastectomy RT are 8 to 13 percent compared with 30 to 35 percent in the nonirradiated control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>]. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists&rsquo; Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) in a meta-analysis of 8135 women in 22 randomized trials showed this benefit of adjuvant radiation even in the setting of one to three positive nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For the 1314 women with axillary dissection and one to three positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p &lt;0.00001), overall recurrence (relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.82, 2p = 0.00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.95, 2p = 0.01). A joint American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Radiation Oncology, and Society of Surgical Oncology panel recommends the use of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with T1-2 breast cancer with one to three positive axillary nodes, although in subsets of patients with low risk of failure, the benefit of PMRT may be outweighed by the risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The skin of the chest wall may also be diffusely involved with inflammatory changes without a discernible mass. The term &quot;carcinoma en cuirasse&quot; refers to a distinct form of local recurrence in which there is diffuse infiltration of the skin or subcutaneous tissues of the chest wall, with woody induration and spread of tumor often beyond the limits of standard surgical or radiation boundaries. Nodules and ulceration are often present.</p><p>The first clinical manifestation of a postmastectomy regional recurrence may be an asymptomatic mass in the axilla or the supraclavicular fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A regional recurrence may also present with pain in either location, or the new onset of brachial plexopathy or lymphedema of the arm. These may occur in the absence of palpable adenopathy. Any patient with new onset of lymphedema after breast cancer treatment should be evaluated for a regional recurrence.

In most series, a disease-free interval of at least two years is associated with a significantly better outcome as compared with shorter durations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/1,5,8,17,20,27,52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,8,17,20,27,52-55</a>]. In a representative report of 230 women with a chest wall or regional nodal recurrence, five-year survival rates were 50 and 35 percent for patients with a disease-free interval of two or more versus less than two years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Long-term local control and overall survival rates are also dependent upon the site and volume of the disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/17,20,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,54</a>]. In general, the greater the disease volume, the lower the likelihood of achieving long-term local control and relapse-free survival.</p><p>Control of a diffuse inflammatory recurrence is more difficult than if disease is limited to an isolated nodule. This difference may reflect surgical resectability of the recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> below.)</p><p>In most series local control rates are highest with either limited chest wall or axillary node involvement, and lower when there is both local and regional recurrence, particularly if the supraclavicular nodes are involved. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of regional axillary and/or supraclavicular recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p>Cure rates seem to fall between those expected for patients with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic disease and those with distant metastases. However, there are few prospective randomized trials, and most available data come from single-institutional experience. For example, in one series of 145 patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) for a postmastectomy locoregional recurrence, five-year survival rates according to the site of disease recurrence were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest wall alone &ndash; 52 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axilla alone &ndash; 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraclavicular nodes alone &ndash; 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest wall plus axilla &ndash; 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraclavicular nodes plus chest <span class=\"nowrap\">wall/axilla</span> &ndash; 7 percent</p><p/><p>Patients who develop a chest wall recurrence after having an initially node-negative breast cancer do better than those who presented with node-positive disease, particularly if more than three nodes were involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/17,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL TREATMENT PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A locoregional recurrence after mastectomy represents a difficult clinical problem, and there is little consensus on how best to manage these patients. Major issues include the lack of randomized trials to guide treatment and the marked evolution in the management of earlier-stage disease over the last decade that has implications for evaluation and management of locoregional recurrence. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the past, nearly all patients with recurrent disease had already undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as a component of upfront therapy. At present, many women have undergone sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy which, if negative, was not followed by ALND. This has implications for the need to restage the axilla at the time of recurrence and for management of the axilla in the face of an axillary regional recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the increasing use of postmastectomy chest wall irradiation, many chest wall recurrences will be in previously irradiated women, whereas in the past, this was a less frequent scenario. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer#H34414723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Patients treated with mastectomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions on local therapy are often altered by whether the patient will have systemic treatment, and in some cases, by the response to such therapy. For some patients (eg, those with an apparently isolated supraclavicular nodal recurrence or a chest wall recurrence that would require a large resection), it is preferable to administer systemic therapy first, not only to facilitate successful locoregional treatment, but also to be certain that early evidence of distant metastases does not emerge.</p><p/><p>Because optimal management of these patients typically requires combined-modality therapy, multidisciplinary assessment and planning is essential. We prefer these patients be presented to a multidisciplinary breast cancer tumor board for formal review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF AN ISOLATED CHEST WALL RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined-modality treatment has the potential to provide long-term disease control for some patients with an isolated chest wall recurrence. However, even if distant metastases are already present, optimal locoregional treatment can significantly reduce the morbidity of uncontrolled local spread.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whenever possible, we prefer a wide local excision for solitary or multiple nodules that are amenable to resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/2,17,19,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,19,57</a>]. For patients who are candidates for radiation therapy (RT), surgical resection reduces the required dose of chest wall RT and maximizes the likelihood of long-term disease control. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Subsequent chest wall recurrences are less frequent in patients who undergo complete excision compared with those who are left with gross residual disease after surgery (21 versus 60 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]). Skin grafts or rotational flaps, such as a latissimus dorsi flap, may be necessary after complete excision. In some cases, chest wall resection and reconstruction may be necessary in order to obtain negative margins. However, extensive surgery for locally recurrent disease should only be performed if other options are not available and if functional morbidity can be minimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. In such cases, initial treatment with systemic therapy is preferable, not only to facilitate successful locoregional treatment, but also to be certain that early evidence of distant metastases does not emerge. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence of a second local recurrence with wide local excision alone is 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/55,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,61</a>]. As a result, most patients who did not receive immediate postmastectomy chest wall irradiation are recommended to undergo RT in addition to surgery for a chest wall recurrence, even if negative margins are achieved.

Because of the increasing use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, many women will have intact axillary nodes unless the initial SLN was positive.

If there is clinical evidence of axillary regional disease, a formal level I and II axillary lymph node dissection ([ALND] if the patient previously had SLN biopsy alone) or axillary exploration with resection (if an ALND was previously performed) is warranted.</p><p>If the patient had a complete ALND initially and has no clinical evidence of regional disease, it is not necessary to reexplore the axilla. </p><p>There is no consensus as to the need for repeat axillary staging and the type of procedure (ALND or reoperative SLN biopsy) that should be done in the setting of a postmastectomy chest wall recurrence and a clinically negative axilla in a patient who previously did not have an ALND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. There is no single recommendation that can be made for all such patients. The decision may best be addressed in the context of a multidisciplinary discussion. Factors to take into account include previous axillary surgery or RT, the initial disease stage and likelihood of distant metastases, the pathology of the recurrence (in situ versus invasive), and the impact that the identification of regional disease will have on adjuvant therapy decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is an integral part of treatment of women with a locoregional breast cancer recurrence.

Outcomes from several retrospective series in which the majority of patients underwent excision followed by RT are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76755 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/8,18-20,27,52,53,57,70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18-20,27,52,53,57,70-72</a>]. Optimal RT management generally involves treatment to the entire chest wall and draining lymph node areas, even if the recurrence is localized to a small area of the chest wall. Limited treatment of the chest wall increases the risk for future recurrences in the supraclavicular and axillary regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/17,20,57,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,57,73</a>]. The RT techniques usually employed are similar to those used for newly diagnosed breast cancer.

Unfortunately, only about one-third of treated patients remain free from distant metastases at five years.</p><p>For patients who have a categorically unresectable chest wall recurrence, reirradiation alone is sometimes attempted. While response rates with RT are high after a less than excisional biopsy (73 percent or higher), approximately 60 to 70 percent will experience a second local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/18,20,52,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,52,61</a>]. Because of the high risk of a second recurrence in these patients, we prefer systemic therapy as initial management using an approach similar to that for patients with metastatic disease.

Full-dose reirradiation of the chest wall is generally not considered because of concerns for long-term toxicity. However, if there are no other viable options, retreatment of at least limited volumes with decreased total radiation doses may be recommended in such patients to maximize the opportunity for local control; whether survival is impacted is unclear.</p><p>The following represents the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One multi-institutional retrospective review of 81 patients who underwent reirradiation of the breast or chest wall (median reirradiation dose 48 Gy) for locally recurrent breast cancer reported an overall complete response rate of 57 percent at a median follow-up of 12 months (range 1 to 44) from the second radiation course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. At reirradiation, 80 percent received standard 1.8 to 2.0 Gy daily treatments, 20 percent received twice-daily RT, 54 percent were treated with concurrent hyperthermia, and 54 percent received concurrent chemotherapy. Reirradiation was well tolerated as only four patients developed late grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Of 25 patients who had follow-up exceeding 20 months, no late grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted. The one-year local disease-free survival rate was significantly higher for patients without gross disease at the time of reirradiation (100 versus 53 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a German series, limited RT fields were used to treat 40 of the 67 patients who recurred in the chest wall after having received immediate postmastectomy chest wall irradiation; the majority was initially resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Locoregional control rates were lower in patients who had received postmastectomy irradiation as compared with the group of patients without preceding irradiation whose RT fields were larger (79 versus 91 percent, respectively). However, five-year survival rates after treatment of the isolated locoregional recurrence were not worse (45 and 40 percent, respectively). Outcomes were not reported for the 27 patients who recurred after receiving immediate postmastectomy RT and who did not undergo reirradiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local control rates of approximately 70 percent at one year have been noted in other small series of patients with a previously irradiated chest wall who were treated with limited irradiation fields to only the site of recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/50,73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,73,74</a>]. In general, treatment-related morbidity has been acceptable and limited to dry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> moist desquamation with no evidence of soft tissue necrosis.</p><p/><p>In general, if reirradiation is undertaken, we try to limit the dose to critical structures, including the ribs, sometimes using a more superficial type of beam (eg, electrons) or twice-a-day irradiation (hyperfractionated RT) to reduce the significant risk of late side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperthermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperthermia in the temperature range from 40 to 45&ordm;C is cytotoxic.

At least six randomized trials have compared RT with and without hyperthermia in the setting of measurable breast cancer where local therapy was indicated and surgery not feasible. Most have never been published, and the trials had a number of weaknesses, including the fact that at least two were stopped before reaching target accrual, the eligibility requirements of all of the trials varied markedly, and the primary endpoint was complete local response rather than survival.</p><p>A meta-analysis was conducted of five of these trials, in which approximately one-half of the total 307 patients had disease outside of the treated area at the time of treatment, and three-fourths progressed outside of the field following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. It was concluded that the addition of hyperthermia to RT improved the complete response rate (59 versus 41 percent), but had no impact on survival (median survival was 18 months regardless of the treatment received). Substantial heterogeneity among the patient populations and the treatment parameters, and the widely varying response rates in the various studies limited the ability to determine what role, if any, was played by hyperthermia as an adjuvant to RT.</p><p>Results from a few more contemporary but uncontrolled series are available that focus on women with recurrent breast cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most favorable report of combined hyperthermia and RT (44 to 66 Gy, median 60 Gy) after a marginal resection included 37 patients who were treated for locally recurrent breast cancer between 1997 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

In the largest of these, 85 patients with locoregionally recurrent breast cancer were treated with the combined approach (mean total RT dose 59.5 Gy) between 1981 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The total RT dose was decreased in approximately one-half (mean total dose 43 Gy) because they had received prior external beam RT. A complete response was achieved in a similar number of previously irradiated and unirradiated patients, but it was low in both groups (56 and 47 percent, respectively). It is not clear whether any patient underwent an attempt at surgical resection prior to thermoradiotherapy.</p><p/><p>Thus, the value of combining hyperthermia with RT in patients with locally recurrent breast cancer remains uncertain, but it remains an interesting area for future research.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1494193827\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of the internal mammary nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether the internal mammary nodes (IMNs) should be included in the RT field is controversial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision by some institutions not to treat the IMNs unless they are radiographically suspicious is based upon the very low incidence of subsequent recurrence in this area, and the potential for increased lung and cardiac morbidity with extension of the radiation fields.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, other institutions routinely include the IMN chain in the RT field, arguing that disease recurrence at this site can lead to direct sternal bone invasion and significant morbidity, and that RT can be delivered more safely than in the past using modern radiation planning techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1494193933\"><span class=\"h2\">Photodynamic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a photosensitizing agent that preferentially accumulates in malignant tissue; subsequent exposure of the tumor to laser light induces a phototoxic reaction and selective tumor necrosis.

However, technical issues such as the optimal photosensitizer dose and route of administration, as well as the proper light dose to minimize treatment-related toxicity are still being worked out.

In particular, the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) conducted a randomized trial addressing chemotherapy after local regional recurrence. This trial only accrued approximately 10 percent of its original goal, and accrual required more than 10 years. Moreover, as one would expect, the disease site, biological subtypes, and prior therapies were quite heterogeneous. Nonetheless, the IBCSG observed a statistically significant disease-free interval (DFI) for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy, and in subgroup analysis, they noted benefits for both DFI and overall survival (OS) in patients with ER-negative, but not positive, disease. Based on these data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ER-negative disease (in whom endocrine therapy is not an option) should be offered chemotherapy following resection of a locoregional recurrence. Whether to give it, and what type, should be based on the patients' overall condition and comorbidities, and in particular, whether, when, and the type of chemotherapy the patient may have already received. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-in-women-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women: Chemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ER-positive disease, endocrine therapy is the primary treatment. The role of chemotherapy should be individualized based on patient preferences because the benefit of additional chemotherapy in these patients is not clear.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>A postmastectomy local recurrence is usually detected clinically as a mass or multiple nodules in the chest wall or overlying skin; uncommonly, an isolated supraclavicular or axillary mass is the only sign. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Between 50 and 70 percent of locoregional recurrences following mastectomy are isolated to the chest wall; 30 to 40 percent have local plus regional recurrence in the supraclavicular, axillary, or internal mammary nodes. One-third of cases have synchronous distant metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with a suspected postmastectomy locoregional recurrence should include a full staging workup to exclude the presence of distant metastases. Biopsy is warranted to confirm the disease recurrence and to test for expression of hormone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Staging workup'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of patients with a locoregional recurrence after mastectomy is complex and usually requires multidisciplinary assessment and planning. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated chest wall recurrence</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend wide local excision of all gross disease, whenever possible, for solitary or multiple nodules that are amenable to resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a large or categorically unresectable chest wall recurrence, we suggest initial chemotherapy rather than locoregional treatment, if the patient is a candidate for systemic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Induction therapy can facilitate successful locoregional treatment, and patients can be observed for early evidence of distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient did not previously have a complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and there is clinical evidence of axillary regional disease, we suggest ALND rather than sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy as long as there is no evidence of distant metastases (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If the patient had a complete ALND initially and has no clinical evidence of regional disease, we suggest not reexploring the axilla (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Management of the axilla'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Opinion differs as to the need for axillary restaging in a patient who had a prior ALND and now presents with a chest wall recurrence and no clinical evidence of regional axillary disease. The decision whether to perform a re-do ALND in this setting should take into account the extent of the previous axillary surgery or radiation therapy (RT), the initial disease stage and likelihood of distant metastases, the pathology of the recurrence (in situ versus invasive), and the impact that the identification of regional disease will have on adjuvant therapy decisions, if any. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Management of the axilla'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have not previously undergone chest wall irradiation, we suggest postresection RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The entire chest wall and draining lymph node areas should be treated, even if the recurrence is localized to a small area of the chest wall (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above). Some institutions consider surgery alone to be an acceptable option if the recurrence pattern is a single nodule, the relapse-free interval is longer than two years, and the resection margins are completely negative. However, this is not a standard approach, and this decision should be made on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of an isolated chest wall recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who previously had immediate postmastectomy RT, we suggest limited field reirradiation only for those patients who have inoperable or incompletely resected recurrent disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management of previously irradiated women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Axillary regional recurrence</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an isolated axillary recurrence or axillary plus chest wall recurrence, management depends on whether ALND was previously undertaken, and whether the patient previously had regional irradiation. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Axillary recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who had an initially negative SLN biopsy but now have an axillary recurrence, we recommend complete axillary lymph node dissection (levels I and II) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients who recur after a prior ALND, we recommend axillary exploration and an attempt to completely resect all disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefit of postresection RT in such patients is unclear, and opinion differs as to the optimal approach:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some institutions offer postresection RT to the axilla and chest wall in women who have not previously received RT, regardless of whether they recurred after SLN biopsy or ALND. For previously irradiated patients, limited field reirradiation is considered only in the setting of an incompletely resected axillary regional recurrence or for local control of inoperable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progressive local disease that is nonresponsive to systemic therapy. The decision to reirradiate limited fields should be individualized, after a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At other institutions, surgery alone is favored for women with an isolated axillary recurrence who did not have an initial ALND, as long as the resection is complete. There is more consensus as to the benefit of postresection RT for patients who have an axillary recurrence after a prior ALND.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">Supraclavicular regional recurrence</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an isolated supraclavicular recurrence without distant metastases should be approached with curative intent. For patients who are considered candidates for systemic therapy, we suggest initial systemic therapy rather than locoregional therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). At the time of restaging, if there is still no evidence of distant metastatic spread, surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT can be offered for disease control, depending on the magnitude of the response, the volume of residual disease, as well as the expected morbidity of both therapies. RT alone may be used if the area was not previously irradiated, surgery alone if RT was previously given, and a combination approach if there has been an incomplete response to chemotherapy.
