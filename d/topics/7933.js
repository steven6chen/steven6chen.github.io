In addition, clozapine is an effective treatment for schizophrenia accompanied by persistent suicidal or self-injurious behavior.

Other clinical indications in schizophrenia patients include sensitivity to extrapyramidal side effects and patients with tardive dyskinesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-treatment-resistant-schizophrenia#H17442645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia&quot;, section on 'Clozapine trial'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692269627\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3542143012\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potentially life-threatening agranulocytosis led to restrictions on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>&rsquo;s use in many countries, but neutrophil monitoring has allowed for safer use of the medication. The US Food and Drug Administration requires patients in the United States to have a minimum absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL</span> to initiate clozapine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An exception is made for patients with benign ethnic neutropenia, who are subject to a lower ANC level. (See <a href=\"#H3455575970\" class=\"local\">'Benign ethnic neutropenia'</a> below.)</p><p>A history of clozapine-induced severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis (ANC below <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL)</span> is a relative contraindication for restarting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>. Because the adverse effects and benefits of the drug vary widely among patients, the risks, benefits, and alternatives need to be weighed for each patient, and clozapine can be restarted if the harm from not using clozapine greatly outweighs the potential risks. Clozapine should be used with extreme caution when restarted. Many patients will quickly develop agranulocytosis again, but they cannot be identified in advance through testing. In a study of 53 patients who had experienced leukopenia or neutropenia from clozapine, 20 patients developed another blood dyscrasia that was more severe and occurred more rapidly upon rechallenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Continuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, as opposed to initiating, is subject to further restrictions in the United States based on ANC monitoring, described below.

Treatment can be instituted and continued in patients with an ANC of at least <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span>. Collaboration with hematology is recommended to manage moderate or severe neutropenia in this patient group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1327562953\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a more complete baseline cardiovascular evaluation (including baseline echocardiogram) may be useful. The prevalence of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is approximately 3 to 5 percent in adults 50 to 70 years old, and is higher among men, older patients, and patients with coronary disease. </p><p>Patients with a history of clozapine-induced myocarditis should only be rechallenged if the harm from not using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> greatly outweighs the potential risks. Individuals with preexisting heart disease are at greater risk of morbidity from clozapine-induced myocarditis or the effects of orthostatic hypotension; they have less cardiac reserve should any, even temporary, cardiac damage and malfunction occur during the initiation of clozapine. When a rechallenge is considered after an episode of myocarditis due to clozapine or clozapine is used in individuals with preexisting heart disease, clozapine should be initiated in the inpatient setting with close monitoring of cardiac function. (See <a href=\"#H1748312328\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2828470380\" class=\"local\">'Myocarditis/cardiomyopathy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515637650\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> is relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure, to be used only if the harm from not using clozapine greatly outweighs the potential risks. Individuals with a seizure disorder should have their seizures optimally controlled before clozapine is started. Patients with an elevated seizure risk, including those with an alcohol use disorder or a history of febrile seizures or epilepsy, should be considered for prophylactic treatment with an anticonvulsant drug when clozapine is initiated. They should be observed carefully as clozapine is initiated, using a conservative titration schedule and therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid excessive clozapine blood levels. A follow-up electroencephalogram may be indicated after clozapine treatment is established, and adjustment of anticonvulsant treatment may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1404562173\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> should be taken into account when weighing the risks and benefits from clozapine. Individuals with obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemias, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease may have worsening of these conditions when treated with clozapine, and more aggressive treatment of these disorders will be required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207140\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pharmacologic mechanisms underlying <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>&rsquo;s superiority for treatment-resistant schizophrenia are not known. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207147\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> binds loosely and transiently to dopamine D2 receptors. Clozapine does not induce catalepsy or inhibit apomorphine-induced stereotypy in animal models as is seen with conventional antipsychotic medications; this may explain its reduced potential for producing movement abnormalities relative to tightly binding dopamine D2 antagonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>. Clozapine also binds to D1, D3, and D5 receptors, and has a high affinity for the D4 receptor, but the implications of these binding activities are unclear.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> also interacts at histamine H1, acetylcholine muscarinic M1 and serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, and at alpha-1-adrenoceptors. Postural dizziness, sedation, and increased appetite may reflect actions of clozapine at alpha-1, H1, and 5-HT2c receptors, respectively. Actions at the 5-HT2A and M1 receptors may reduce movement side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207154\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> is well absorbed. First-pass metabolism reduces its bioavailability to 60 to 70 percent of the administered dose; food has little effect on the bioavailability of clozapine. The elimination half-life of clozapine averages approximately 14 hours under steady state conditions, but there is substantial variability across individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver, and excreted in both the urine and feces. Cytochrome P450 1A2 is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism; cytochromes 2C, 2D6, and <span class=\"nowrap\">3A3/4</span> play less important roles. Agents that induce cytochrome CYP1A2, such as tobacco cigarette smoke, will increase the metabolism of clozapine. Tobacco smokers may require twice the dose of nonsmokers to achieve similar blood levels. Agents that inhibit CYP1A2 (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>) will decrease the metabolism of clozapine and may produce clinical toxicity at usual doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Cytochrome-related problems can be avoided by monitoring clozapine plasma levels while gradually increasing clozapine from a low starting dose. (See <a href=\"#H528606618\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> below.)</p><p>The major metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine), has failed to demonstrate any therapeutic activity in clinical trials. Clozapine and norclozapine plasma levels are both reported by clinical labs, but only the clozapine level is useful for dose optimization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3799781774\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662821133\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment prior to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> should include evaluation of the patient&rsquo;s general and cardiovascular health status.

During the initial titration in inpatient settings, twice or three times daily dosing is typically employed to reduce autonomic side effects, like orthostatic hypotension, and to take advantage of clozapine&rsquo;s sedating effects. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased gradually, typically by 12.5 to 25 mg every one to two days, with the target dose and frequency determined by the plasma clozapine level and adverse effects. A clozapine plasma level can be checked after an initial target dose is reached, generally after two weeks in the inpatient setting. Given the pharmacokinetics of clozapine, differences of a few hours in the time of evening dosing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> morning plasma sampling will lead to large differences in reported plasma levels. Orthostatic blood pressure should be monitored daily when feasible (ie, in inpatient setting).</p><p>A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> plasma level in the range of 250 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is a reasonable target for a patient with schizophrenia, but patients show great variation in both their symptomatic response and side effects. Once the target dose is reached, the patient&rsquo;s clinical response should be monitored for two weeks before a further increase. There is little evidence to suggest greater efficacy at blood levels greater than 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> but outliers may exist. Side effects such as sleepiness and electroencephalogram slowing increase as clozapine blood levels increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>A maintenance dose of 300 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is usually required for efficacy. Doses higher than 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> are not recommended. In the older adult and medically ill population, the titration may need to be slower, and maintenance doses are typically in the 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> range. However, due to great interindividual variability in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> metabolism, rare patients can reach toxic levels with low doses like 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and some patients fail to achieve therapeutic levels with 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>Once the patient is stabilized on an effective maintenance dose, all or most of the daily dose may be given at bedtime. This will aid patients in getting to sleep and avoiding daytime sedation. Compliance can be improved by taking the medication at the time of routine, consistent behaviors, such as breakfast or bedtime preparations, and by prescribing once or twice daily rather than more frequently. However, some patients require split doses to avoid bed wetting or morning grogginess.</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> treatment is interrupted for more than two days, clozapine needs to be restarted carefully, with 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well tolerated, however, the previous dose can be achieved more quickly compared with patients who are initially started on clozapine. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521211297\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2966456257\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutrophil count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> in the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration requires regular monitoring and registry reporting of neutrophil counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This process has been successful in allowing safe use of clozapine while avoiding deaths due to clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Revisions to United States regulations in 2015 lowered certain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) thresholds, expanding the number of patients eligible to receive the medication, and permitted clinicians to override ANC-based treatment recommendations to continue or restart clozapine in patients for whom the benefits of clozapine clearly exceed the risk of agranulocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Six separate registries administered by clozapine manufacturers were replaced with a single registry (the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy [REMS] Program, <a href=\"https://www.clozapinerems.com/&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX//H/lCKGrzlHFyN341bnsw7igssZK1rDpKBP7LwFaYfG0dmfldXcEr&amp;TOPIC_ID=5137\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://www.clozapinerems.com/</a>). </p><p>As part of REMS, clinicians need to be registered and demonstrate that they are competent to prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> (ie, review clozapine-related materials from the Clozapine REMS Program website and pass a knowledge test). Pharmacies also need to be certified if they dispense clozapine. In order to receive clozapine, a patient must be entered into this registry and undergo regular monitoring of ANC that continues as long as a patient receives clozapine (&ldquo;No blood, no drug&rdquo;). Routine neutrophil monitoring is performed at the following intervals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weekly during the first six months of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> administration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every other week for the second six months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every four weeks after one year, for the duration of treatment</p><p/><p>If neutropenia develops during treatment, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> would either need to be monitored more frequently, stopped temporarily, or discontinued, based on the severity of neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild neutropenia (ANC: 1000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1499/microL)</span> &ndash; Continue treatment but increase monitoring frequency to three times per week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate neutropenia (ANC: 500 to <span class=\"nowrap\">999/microL)</span> &ndash; Interrupt <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> treatment, increase monitoring to daily until ANC is <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> at which point clozapine can be reinstituted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe <span class=\"nowrap\">neutropenia/agranulocytosis</span> (ANC: <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL)</span> &ndash; Discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>.
