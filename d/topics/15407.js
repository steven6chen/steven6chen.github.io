Because early learning experiences influence the manner in which a child relates to others during the course of his or her life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], it is important to try to ensure that the child begins school when he or she is developmentally ready to participate in classroom activities with the greatest likelihood of success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The idea that all children should start school &quot;ready to learn&quot; was part of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act enacted by the United States Congress in 1994 and is the first stated goal of the <a href=\"http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/negp/page3.htm&amp;token=jCmiK/3B2Tq0eT5j1rXPVVVun5wdUgN+HYDy0SQ5gAFyBHP2X0CzNFuS7pA3SqFWbwgC8AVAYVvdw86CJYNW+g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=592\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Educational Goals Panel</a> which was established in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The idea of &quot;school readiness&quot; has traditionally implied that there is a measurable standard against which a given child's physical, intellectual, and socioemotional functioning can be compared, and that meeting the standard predicts future academic success. Such is not the case. Empiric evidence of such readiness standards does not exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], nor is there a consensus among educators about what constitutes readiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].

The accountability requirements of NCLB have been associated with changes in teacher beliefs about prekindergarten skills required for success and in the emphasis of various subjects taught during kindergarten.

Although it is not the only factor, lack of readiness contributes to early grade retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of children repeat kindergarten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Retention rates appear to have declined over time. However, there has been an increase in the number of children delaying entry to kindergarten by a year, perhaps due to increased expectations for readiness.</p><p>Social factors, particularly poverty, play an important role in school success and failure. Health and social factors related to early school failure among the general population were studied among a nationally representative sample of nearly 10,000 American children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Poverty had the strongest association with grade retention. Other variables that were independently associated with increased risk of grade retention included, male sex, low maternal education, speech defects, low birth weight, enuresis, and exposure to household smoking.</p><p>Between 32 and 50 percent of preschoolers have at least one risk factor for learning difficulties, and approximately 15 percent have more than one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20</a>]. Exposure to multiple risk factors increases the probability of development of socioemotional problems, which adversely affect school performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,22</a>]. The combination of risk factors, rather than any single factor, best predicts the child's socioemotional functioning and academic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additional risk factors for socioemotional problems include parental depression (particularly maternal depression), substance abuse, domestic violence, homelessness, psychiatric disturbance, and exposure to repeated major life stressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>].</p><p>Although children can be resilient or have families that buffer them from adverse effects, it is important to recognize the risk factors mentioned above, since early recognition may permit intervention before school problems emerge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,14,16,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,16,25-30</a>]. Identification of problems in a school-age child should prompt prevention efforts in preschool-age siblings.</p><p>Research on protective factors is less well developed than that on risk factors but suggests a continuum of protective effects, which are more or less powerful depending upon the combination. In a nationally representative sample of nearly 10,000 American children, high maternal education and residence with both biologic parents at age six years were independently associated with decreased risk of retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In another study, children who participated in Head Start showed better literacy (which in turn predicts school success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]) than age-matched peers who did not participate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Nonetheless, there are steps that families and health care providers can take to ensure that their children and patients, respectively, are adequately prepared to enter school &quot;ready to learn.&quot; These steps are described below. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Readiness of the child'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Promotion of school readiness'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">READINESS OF THE CHILD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596370397\"><span class=\"h2\">Domains of readiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, readiness of a child to attend school referred to the child's level of cognitive functioning and focused specifically on whether or not the child had sufficiently mastered certain foundational academic skills. However, kindergarten teachers often feel the purpose of kindergarten is to teach those very skills. Still, children who have mastered such rudimentary skills as counting with one-to-one correspondence, recognizing numbers and letters, and mastering quantitative and relational concepts (eg, bigger than, equal to) are more likely to learn to read and do math earlier and better than children who do not possess those skills at kindergarten entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Although mastery of cursory academics is important, the scope of the child's readiness has been expanded by the National Educational Goals Panel (NEGP) to include a total of five domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical wellbeing and motor development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social and emotional development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child's approach to learning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognition and general knowledge</p><p/><p>The five domains of the child's readiness for school are interrelated and overlap to some degree. The child's readiness is no longer defined by whether he or she has mastered specific skills; rather, it is viewed as a complex network of development that spans physical, cognitive, social, and community functioning.</p><p>There is variation among children with respect to the domains that are mastered before kindergarten entry. In part, these differences are related to early experiences, such as enrollment in quality day care, cultural environments that emphasize varying behaviors and activities, inborn <span class=\"nowrap\">developmental/physical</span> characteristics, and family risk factors. Even children with seemingly inadequate school readiness skills are capable of acquiring some new skills while in kindergarten. However, children with a solid base of school readiness skills appear to learn more, and to learn more quickly, than children without that foundation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical wellbeing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical wellbeing and motor development of children varies depending upon their health status, growth, physical abilities and disabilities, and prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Although normal physical fitness helps the child to pay attention and participate in social and academic activities, impaired physical or motor development does not prevent the child from entering school. It may, however, affect the child's ability to perform school-related activities and should be considered when making educational programming and service decisions.

Chronic medical conditions may be associated with pain or discomfort that can affect attention and readiness to learn. Medications used to treat chronic conditions may affect cognitive functions. Children with chronic conditions may require a plan to receive medications or urgent medical therapy at school.

Children are most likely to be academically successful when teaching styles match their learning styles, yet standard school curricula often favor one style over others (eg, visual rather than auditory) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergent-literacy-including-language-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergent literacy including language development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Delayed language development is the most common reason identified by kindergarten teachers for lack of readiness among kindergarten students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The timing of language deficits appears to be more important than the persistence of them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The presence of language problems immediately before kindergarten entry (ie, at 4.5 years of age) was highly correlated with decreased school readiness, whereas early language problems that had seemingly resolved did not have an adverse impact on school readiness. Receptive language problems were a stronger predictor of inadequate school readiness than expressive language problems. Parents can promote the development of language skills in their children by reading with them daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-86</a>], reviewing linguistic concepts, helping them to identify the sound patterns, and helping them to understand and retell stories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74888\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74888 \">table 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergent-literacy-including-language-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergent literacy including language development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children use language not only for basic communication but also to access information in their knowledge stores. Thus, language is crucial for conceptual development and reasoning. Language development is strongly associated with conventional definitions of academic success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, this notion of academic success has limited applicability for the non-English-dominant child, an issue that is of increasing importance as societal demographics continue to evolve.</p><p>Language development is closely interwoven with socioemotional development. The use of language requires agreement about the ways in which words are used and the structure of communication within a group. Most of a child's language development occurs through his or her interaction with other people, particularly parents and caregivers, who often provide bridges in early communication efforts (eg, asking questions to help clarify the child's expressions).</p><p>The way in which children acquire and use language varies between cultural groups; even within a single sociocultural group, the rate of language acquisition varies considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In addition, the language of an individual child may vary depending upon the setting. By the time they enter school, children have developed language functions within the background of their home and community environments; thus, a child's language skills are embedded in his or her cultural background. If that cultural background involves experiences discrepant from typical school experiences, the child may have more difficulty using his or her language abilities in school. Educators and parents should be sensitive to such struggles.</p><p>Literacy begins to develop before the child learns how to read; it includes the idea of assigning meaning to symbols, as well as how to listen and remember. Early exposure to books and reading is highly beneficial, although exposure to words can occur in other ways (eg, street signs, television, clothing labels, etc). Simple participation in routine activities contributes to language development. As an example, during make-believe activities, children are exposed to the process of structuring stories by role-playing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognition and general knowledge involve the recognition that different objects have various characteristics (eg, color, shape, size, number, and spatial relations) and the ability to make comparative distinctions on the basis of those characteristics. It also includes being familiar with conventions of print (in English, reading top to bottom) and understanding sound-symbol associations. Parents can promote cognitive and general knowledge skills through various activities at home and in the community (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70285 \">table 1A</a>).</p><p>In the past, cognitive ability (ie, intelligence) was the primary, if not sole, indicator of school readiness, and social conventional knowledge (eg, ability to name colors and count) was the predominant area of skill development. Cognitive ability continues to be the domain that is most commonly associated with school readiness, particularly by parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. However, the NEGP's view of this domain encompasses all types of knowledge: physical, logico-mathematical, and social-conventional.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical knowledge refers to the recognition that objects have physical properties in an external reality. The properties can be learned through observation and experience. In handling a ball, for example, one learns that it has weight and size and rolls downward when placed on an incline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Logico-mathematical knowledge refers to the relationships and associations individuals create in their minds between and among objects: for example, perceiving two objects to be different because of variance in a particular physical property (eg, color, size). Logico-mathematical knowledge is difficult to assess because of its complexity, but understanding relationships is integral to problem solving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social-conventional knowledge refers to school-learned, society-endorsed &quot;facts&quot; that are maintained across generations. For example, use of a Judeo-Christian calendar system, agreeing that the English alphabet consists of 26 letters, and that the color of the daytime sky usually is &quot;blue,&quot; whereas the sun is &quot;yellow.&quot; Social-conventional knowledge is the type of knowledge on which the assessment of a child's cognitive capabilities is typically focused, even though it has the greatest variation across cultural groups and is the easiest to acquire.</p><p/><p>The three types of knowledge are interrelated yet distinct. Children must develop a classification system that discriminates objects before they can &quot;read&quot; the physical properties. They may be able to count by rote to 10, but if they do not understand one-to-one correspondence, they will be unable to say how many blocks are in a stack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronologic age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to enroll in kindergarten, children must reach their fifth birthday by a date that is arbitrarily set by the school system, usually the first day of September or October [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H558613169\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed or early enrollment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For typically developing children, neither delayed nor early entrance into kindergarten has been shown to yield substantial differences in academic skill development after the first few years of school. However, both deviations from the norm increase the likelihood of subsequent psychosocial struggles.</p><p>Empiric evidence supports the enrollment of children in kindergarten at the age-appropriate time (which varies to some degree by school district). If there is concern about a child's ability to successfully participate in kindergarten, parents, teachers, and health care providers should carefully consider the potential benefit and detriment that can arise from either course of action, and if the decision is to proceed with enrollment, they should communicate frequently during the first weeks of school to determine whether special programming or services are necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed enrollment</strong> &ndash; Parents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> teachers may advocate delaying kindergarten enrollment for some children who are deemed to be &quot;unready.&quot; This is particularly true of boys who have birthdays that are near the cut-off date. This practice is based on an assumption that the child needs more time to develop basic cognitive or psychosocial skills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, waiting an extra year does not yield any noticeable benefit, particularly if the child remains in the environment where readiness was not fostered. In fact, for attainment of basic academic skills, (eg, sound-symbol awareness, letter and number recognition, counting) the effects of schooling outweigh the effects of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

Academic performance and social abilities of students who enrolled at five years of age and those who delayed enrollment are similar after first or second grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/90-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-94</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Moreover, students who are older than classmates are more likely to drop out of school in later grades than their age-appropriate peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. The causality of this association has not been established; the high drop-out rate may be related to factors that contributed to delayed enrollment, rather than delayed enrollment itself. Students older than their classroom peers also have more parent-reported behavior problems and youth-reported health-risk behaviors (eg, substance use) than their age-appropriate peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early enrollment</strong> &ndash; Parents also may advocate for early kindergarten enrollment (ie, at age four years) for their children who seem to have more advanced skills than their same-age peers.

However, observational data suggest that children learn more efficiently from real interaction with people and things than from situations appearing on a video (television, tablet, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Excessive television viewing limits the time that children spend in other activities that promote learning (eg, reading, playing with peers, coloring, building with blocks, puzzles, etc). Television programming should be closely monitored by caregivers so as to take advantage of the benefits available and to ensure exposure to appropriate models of behavior.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Components of readiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are five domains of school readiness for the child: physical wellbeing and motor development; social and emotional development; the child's approach to learning; language development; and cognition and general knowledge. Children's mastery of specific skills before kindergarten entry varies. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Readiness of the child'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For typically developing children, neither delayed nor early entrance into kindergarten has been shown to yield substantial differences in academic skill development after the first few years of school. (See <a href=\"#H558613169\" class=\"local\">'Delayed or early enrollment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The readiness of the school refers to the educational system's ability to address the needs of the young children, regardless of the child's cognitive abilities. The school system should be prepared to educate kindergarten students who have a range of developmental abilities and skills. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Readiness of the school'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Community and family supports for school readiness include high-quality preschool programs; programs to optimize the child's nutrition, physical activity, and health (eg, supplemental nutrition programs, immunization initiatives); and programs that help parents to be more effective in their role as their child's first teacher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70285%7EPEDS%2F74888%7EPEDS%2F54909\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70285 graphicRef74888 graphicRef54909 \">table 1A-C</a>).
