SCLC comprises approximately 15 percent of all lung cancers. It occurs almost exclusively in cigarette smokers; in one series, only 2 percent of 500 patients with SCLC did not have a smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. SCLC is also the most common histologic subtype among uranium miners, probably due to exposure to radioactive radon, which is a byproduct of uranium decay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SCLC is distinguished from NSCLC by its rapid growth characteristics and the early development of widespread metastases. SCLC is highly responsive to chemotherapy, while there is a substantial historical experience documenting the futility of surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (RT) without systemic chemotherapy. Prior to the introduction of systemic chemotherapy, median survivals for patients with limited stage (LS) disease (limited to the ipsilateral hemithorax and regional lymph nodes) and extensive stage (ES) disease were approximately 12 weeks and 5 weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many studies have demonstrated that chemotherapy significantly improves survival when compared with surgery or RT alone, and combination chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy for both LS and ES SCLC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>Although the combination of chemotherapy plus radiation improves survival in patients with LS-SCLC, local recurrence rates in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy are between 35 and 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This high local failure rate has led to reconsideration of the role of surgery as a way to improve rates of local control. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H824558\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT OF LS-SCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SCLC are often staged as those with LS disease (limited to the ipsilateral hemithorax and regional lymph nodes) and those with more extensive stage (ES) disease. Most patients with LS-SCLC will have clinical or pathologic evidence of mediastinal lymph node disease. Careful staging, including invasive staging of the mediastinum and MRI of the brain, is indicated to identify the small fraction of patients with LC-SCLC who do not have mediastinal or metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with LS-SCLC who have clinical or pathologic evidence of mediastinal disease, chemoradiotherapy is indicated as the initial treatment.

This should then be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy as in patients with more extensive disease. (See <a href=\"#H542557076\" class=\"local\">'Surgery as initial therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H542556915\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative chemotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY ALONE FOR LS-SCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple observational series support the conclusion that surgery alone cannot be considered adequate as the primary treatment for LS-SCLC.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial conducted by the British Medical Research Council study in the 1960s randomly assigned 144 patients with apparently resectable SCLC to either surgical resection or RT. The study demonstrated an extremely poor survival for both treatment groups. The median, one, and five year survivals were 6.5 months, 21 percent, and 1 percent for those randomized to surgery and 10 months, 22 percent and 4 percent for those assigned to RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These outcomes are consistent with historical data from the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among patients with SCLC seen between 1931 and 1971, only 7 percent had resectable tumors and only two patients survived for five years. Similar results were obtained in another report in which one 1 of 368 surgically treated patients with SCLC survived five years following resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This contrasted with a 15 to 25 percent five-year survival for patients with NSCLC.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY IN MULTIMODALITY TREATMENT FOR LS-SCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCLC is a highly malignant neoplasm that should always be presumed to be systemic, even when apparently localized. The issue is whether surgery might be beneficial as a component of combined modality therapy and, if it has role, how it should be integrated with chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542557076\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery as initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend surgical resection for patients who present with a solitary pulmonary nodule that has been diagnosed as SCLC and who have no evidence of hilar or mediastinal nodal involvement, no distant metastases, and no contraindications to surgery. There are no clinical trials that directly compare a combined modality approach including surgery to chemoradiotherapy alone. Retrospective data cannot exclude the possibility that the observed survival outcomes in resected SCLC are due to reduced tumor burden among patients in whom resection is possible or that these patients have biologically less aggressive disease.</p><p>The most extensive data suggesting a benefit from surgery in patients with LS-SCLC come from the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Lung Cancer Study Project [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The IASLC database of over 8000 cases of SCLC included 349 cases (4 percent) in which the cancer was resected and staged pathologically. The five-year survival rates for patients with pathologic stage I, II, and III SCLC were 48, 39, and 15 percent, respectively. Similar results were seen in a Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database study of 247 patients with stage I SCLC who underwent resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, evidence from multiple clinical trials indicates that a nonsurgical (chemoradiotherapy) approach results in a five year survival rate of 10 to 15 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management#H1147048869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Benefit of treatment'</a>.) </p><p>Patients who are being considered for primary resection of a known SCLC should undergo extensive evaluation for mediastinal involvement and distant metastases. This evaluation should include PET-CT and brain imaging. Invasive staging of the mediastinum by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or mediastinoscopy should be obtained even if there is no evidence of mediastinal involvement by imaging since there can be a significant discrepancy between clinical and pathological staging in SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>In many cases a solitary pulmonary nodule is resected before a histologic diagnosis is established. In one series, 4 to 12 percent of lung cancers that presented as a solitary pulmonary nodule were SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In another report, 4 percent of patients with SCLC presented as a solitary pulmonary nodule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of SCLCs that present as a solitary pulmonary nodule are the &quot;intermediate cell&quot; histologic subtype. This finding is in striking contrast to SCLC presenting with more widespread disease, in which approximately two-thirds are comprised of classic &quot;oat cell&quot; subtypes. Whether the biology of these different subtypes is the same remains uncertain.</p><p>The use of surgery in this setting is consistent with guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542556915\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who have undergone a complete resection for SCLC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized clinical trials that have compared surgery alone versus surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. However, observational studies have suggested improved outcomes with adjuvant chemotherapy. In a study of over 1500 patients with pT1-2N0M0 SCLC in the National Cancer Database, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (with or without radiation) experienced an improved five-year survival compared with those undergoing surgery alone (53 versus 40 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another series of 119 patients who underwent surgical resection for SCLC , 112 of whom also received adjuvant chemotherapy, the five-year survival rates for those with pathologic stage I, II, or III disease were 51, 28, and 19 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is in contrast to results from earlier studies that demonstrated a five year-survival rate of 1 percent among patients treated with surgery alone. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Surgery alone for LS-SCLC'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31490992\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use sequential adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in individuals who are found to have unsuspected N2 involvement at their surgical resection, although there are no reliable data regarding the efficacy of adjuvant thoracic radiation in this setting. Patients with N1 involvement may also be considered for adjuvant RT, particularly if only limited nodal assessment was performed at surgery. In patients treated by lobectomy in which the nodes are pathologically negative and where a good nodal evaluation was performed, the role of adjuvant RT is possibly less important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>A retrospective review of 3017 patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) enrolled in the National Cancer Database suggested that postoperative thoracic RT was associated with a five-year overall survival benefit among those with pathologic N2 disease (29 versus 19 percent), but not among those with lesser degrees of nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with pathologic N0 disease had decreased five-year overall survival with RT (39 versus 46 percent, respectively), while there were no differences in survival among patients with pathologic N1 disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31490998\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic cranial irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data directly evaluating the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients who have undergone surgical resection of SCLC in a solitary pulmonary nodule; the role of PCI in this setting is controversial </p><p>PCI can be considered for these patients, based upon the data that has established a role for PCI in individuals with limited disease treated with chemoradiation therapy. &#160; We recommend a consultation with radiation oncology, where an informed discussion about the potential merits and side effects of PCI should be held. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery after induction chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential role of surgical resection following induction chemotherapy remains uncertain. In very rare and carefully selected individuals with node positive limited SCLC at presentation (clinical stages II to IIIa), we will consider adjuvant surgical resection after chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy when a good response has been documented. </p><p>In general, we reserve this approach for individuals without persistent mediastinal (N2) involvement in whom a complete (R0) resection is likely and where resection requires less than a pneumonectomy. Prior to surgery these patients undergo a complete metastatic re-evaluation, including CT PET and brain MRI. Mediastinoscopy assessment is mandatory if endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) evaluation of their mediastinal compartment was negative.</p><p>One randomized trial suggested that this approach did not improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], but more recent observational studies using contemporary chemotherapy regimens suggest that there may be a role for surgery in carefully selected populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized phase III trial conducted by the Lung Cancer Study Group in 340 patients with SCLC failed to provide any evidence for benefit from surgery following induction chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Those with stage IIB, IIIA, or IIIB SCLC were given three cycles of cisplatin and etoposide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
