The causes of goiter in children and adults are similar, but their relative frequency varies substantially. In the United States, for example, most children with a goiter have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, whereas among adults, nontoxic nodular goiters predominate.</p><p>Goiter may be present at birth or detected at any age thereafter. The goiter may be caused by increased thyrotropin (TSH) secretion (acting as a thyroid growth factor) resulting from hypothyroidism; antibodies that activate TSH receptors (Graves' disease) with increased thyroid hormone secretion; or TSH-independent processes, such as inflammation associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, benign and malignant tumors, and infiltrative disease.</p><p>Once a goiter is detected, the appropriate diagnostic evaluation is aimed at identifying the underlying cause and assessing thyroid function. Both of these factors will determine management. This topic review will consider congenital and acquired goiters, independent of their function, in infants and children.</p><p>Thyroid nodules and cancers, and the causes of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in children are discussed separately.

They may be familial, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In a study of female twins in Denmark, for example, the cumulative concordance rates for goiter in monozygotic and dizygotic twins were 53 percent and 20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The cause of colloid goiter in children is not known. Although the thyroid gland is usually diffusely enlarged, it can be asymmetric or nodular. Thyroid function is normal, and serum antithyroid antibody concentrations are normal. Histologic examination reveals flattened epithelium, variable follicular size, and dense colloid. These goiters usually gradually decrease in size over several years; the course is not altered by T4 therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Iodine-deficiency goiter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 2 billion people worldwide are at risk for iodine deficiency and, therefore, for iodine-deficiency (endemic) goiter. Iodine supplementation, primarily through iodized salt, has eradicated iodine-deficiency goiter in the United States. Median urinary iodine excretion in adults decreased by approximately 50 percent in the United States from the 1970s to the 1990s (from 320 to 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [2.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> indicative of a substantial decline in iodine intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Values less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> are associated with goiter, raising the possibility of recrudescence of endemic goiter. It appears that this decrease has stabilized, as a more recent survey (2001 to 2002) reports median urinary iodine excretion of 167.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with moderate or severe iodine deficiency and goiter have subclinical or overt (mild) hypothyroidism, but their serum T3 concentrations may be normal or high because of preferential thyroidal T3 secretion. They can be treated with either iodine or T4. Even in iodine-sufficient countries, a food-restricted diet low in iodine has been reported to cause goiter and hypothyroidism, as in a more recent report of a four-year-old boy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Vitamin A deficiency increased the odds for goiter formation in severe iodine-deficient children by increasing TSH stimulation, which reduced the risk for hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Eradication of endemic iodine-deficiency goiter can take up to a decade after initiation of iodine prophylaxis in a geographic region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Iodine-deficiency goiter can occur in neonates, but it is rare. Many neonates and infants with endemic cretinism do not have a goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] because they are no longer hypothyroid (neurologic cretinism) or their thyroid has been destroyed (hypothyroid cretinism).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Ingestion of goitrogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common goitrogen ingested by children is iodine, most often in the form of iodine-containing expectorants for chronic reactive airways disease or cystic fibrosis. Children living in a region with a high content of iodine in the drinking water (&gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ug/L)</span> are at risk for goiter development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Another source of iodine is kelp. Most children with iodine-induced goiters probably have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis; they develop a goiter because the damaged thyroid cannot adapt to a high iodine intake. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lithium</a> carbonate may cause hypothyroidism and goiter in children as well as in adults. Cessation of the offending drug or food supplement should result in restoration of normal thyroid function and diminution of the goiter. Interferon treatment may be associated with the development of thyroiditis and disturbances of thyroid function (either hypo- and hyperthyroidism), and, in a few patients, the development of a goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

It should be suspected in any child with a painful, tender goiter. Its course in children is similar to that in adults, with an early painful, hyperthyroid phase followed by euthyroid and then hypothyroid phases, and finally recovery. Treatment consists of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or, in very symptomatic patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>. If patients have symptoms of hyperthyroidism with a suppressed serum TSH level, they may be treated with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, while during the hypothyroid phase they may require thyroid hormone replacement.

The clinical presentation is characterized by abrupt onset of painful, tender swelling of one lobe of the thyroid accompanied by fever, chills, sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia. The left lobe is more commonly involved, and a pyriform sinus fistula is usually present (it can be detected by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow or CT or MRI of the neck, and less frequently by ultrasonography).

Normally the duct involutes, but cysts can form within it. Most are located in the midline between the hyoid bone and the isthmus of the thyroid.

Once detected, the cysts should be removed surgically. Most contain no thyroid cells, but a few do (thyroid ectopia). Very rarely, they are the patient's only thyroid tissue, so that the patient becomes hypothyroid after the 'cyst' is removed. A thyroid scan is recommended before surgery to determine if other thyroid tissue is present.
