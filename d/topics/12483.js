In 1868, Carl Wunderlich proposed that the mean normal body temperature was 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F) with an upper limit of normal of 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F), above which fever was defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Despite the observation that there is a range of normal body temperatures, in one survey, a majority (75 percent) of 270 medical professionals reported the belief that normal body temperature is 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A survey of members of the British Society for Haematology regarding their institutional definitions of fever identified 10 definitions of fever, ranging from a single temperature &gt;37.5&deg;C to either a single temperature &gt;39&deg;C or two successive temperatures &gt;38.4&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These beliefs notwithstanding, the empirically observed mean oral temperature of 148 healthy adults between ages 18 and 40 years was reported as 36.8&plusmn;0.4&deg;C (98.2&plusmn;0.7&deg;F) with a range of 35.6&deg;C (96.0&deg;F) to 38.2&deg;C (100.8&deg;F), the latter defining the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America defines fever in neutropenic patients as a single oral temperature of &ge;38.3&deg;C (101&deg;F) or a temperature of &ge;38.0&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) sustained over a one-hour period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We agree with using this definition of fever in neutropenic patients. Similar definitions have been provided from South America, Europe, and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>It is known from animal models that glucocorticoids may have a mitigating effect on the development of fever due to bacterial or endogenous pyrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The antipyretic effect of concomitant use of glucocorticoids in neutropenic patients may confound the recognition of an infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The presence of signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), including tachycardia, tachypnea, or hypotension in an afebrile neutropenic patient who is receiving concomitant glucocorticoids, should raise the suspicion of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H981551211\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of neutropenia varies from institution to institution, but neutropenia is usually defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> and severe neutropenia is usually defined as an ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or an ANC that is expected to decrease to &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> over the next 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].

The International Immunocompromised Host Society has classified initial neutropenic fever syndromes into the following three categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microbiologically documented infection &ndash; Neutropenic fever with a clinical focus of infection and an associated pathogen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically documented infection &ndash; Neutropenic fever with a clinical focus (eg, cellulitis, pneumonia) but without the isolation of an associated pathogen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained fever &ndash; Neutropenic fever with neither a clinical focus of infection nor an identified pathogen</p><p/><p>The first neutropenic fever is the first febrile episode occurring during a given period of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. A persistent neutropenic fever syndrome is a febrile episode without defervescence after at least five days of initial empiric broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy in high-risk neutropenic patients or after at least two days in low-risk neutropenic patients. A recrudescent neutropenic fever syndrome is a febrile episode that recurs following initial defervescence during a course of broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy.</p><p>The <strong>myeloid reconstitution syndrome</strong> is defined by fever and a new inflammatory focus or progression of a preexisting inflammatory focus in temporal relationship to neutrophil recovery from aplasia. This syndrome is similar to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome that can follow the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV infection.

This group of patients has been well studied in randomized trials and has been shown to be at low risk for serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Patients with neutropenic fever who have ongoing comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction are also considered to be high risk, regardless of the duration of neutropenia. Other criteria that confer a high-risk status can be found in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67027 \">table 1</a>).<br/><br/>Some experts have defined high-risk patients as those expected to have profound neutropenia (ANC &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> for &gt;7 days based on experience that such patients are the most likely to have life-threatening complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, formal studies to clearly differentiate between patients with an ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> are lacking. For the purposes of this discourse, we will combine these groups. Profound prolonged neutropenia (ie, ANC &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> expected to last &gt;7 days) is most likely to occur in the preengraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.</p><p/><p>An alternative to using the clinical criteria described above is to use the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index, which is a validated tool for measuring the risk for neutropenic fever-related medical complications (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-multinational-association-for-supportive-care-in-cancer-mascc-risk-index-for-patients-with-neutropenic-fever-not-appropriate-for-children-less-than16-years-of-age\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The risk assessment of patients with neutropenic fever is discussed in greater detail separately.

On the one hand, the risk of serious complications in high-risk patients who are not treated promptly is substantial. On the other hand, the potential toxicity of antimicrobial agents, the potential impact of antimicrobial use on resistance, and the costs of hospitalization and antimicrobial therapy are significant factors. It is therefore critical to accurately assess body temperature in order to aggressively treat patients with neutropenic fever and to avoid the overtreatment of stable neutropenic patients who do not have a fever.</p><p>There is no universally preferred method for measuring body temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and the method used varies by institution.

Early studies of patients with neutropenic fever documented mortality rates of up to 70 percent if initiation of antibiotics was delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of 2731 patients with septic shock (only 7 percent of whom were neutropenic), each hour delay in initiating effective antimicrobials decreased survival by approximately 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The in-hospital mortality among adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock decreased from 33 to 20 percent (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.83) when the time from triage to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was one hour or less compared with more than one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. One cohort study observed that each hour delay in the time to empiric antibacterial administration in febrile neutropenic patients increased the 28-day mortality by 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Although some investigators have reported the importance of protocol compliance, including timely administration of empiric antibiotics, for lowering complication rates and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>], a large cohort study of low-risk febrile neutropenic cancer patients failed to demonstrate a survival benefit of early initiation of empiric antibacterial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, this population was at low risk for mortality (2.8 percent) with low incidences of microbiologically documented infection (12 percent) and resistant pathogens (6 percent). The ability to detect a protocol-driven impact on outcomes such as mortality may have been obscured in this study. Moreover, it was not possible to control for the duration of clinical illness before the patients presented for triage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The weight of evidence continues to support early and appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapy to enhance the chances of therapeutic success.</p><p>The successful management of neutropenic fever and sepsis syndromes is a time-dependent process analogous to acute stroke or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In one study, almost one-half (45 percent) of febrile neutropenic cancer patients presenting to emergency departments in France had evidence of a sepsis syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Approximately 2 to 5 percent of febrile neutropenic patients seeking medical care from the emergency department require critical care services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>].</p><p>The reported median times from assessment of febrile neutropenic cancer patients in an emergency department setting to the initiation of empiric antibacterial therapy have ranged widely from 15 minutes to over 9 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/9,61,64,67-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,61,64,67-71</a>]. Audits from the United Kingdom reported that only 18 to 26 percent of patients received initial empiric antibacterial therapy within the one-hour &quot;door-to-needle&quot; target timeframe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/9,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,70</a>]. The most common reasons for failure to comply with this timeframe have included failure to administer the initial dose of the empiric antibacterial regimen until the patient has been transferred from the emergency department to the inpatient ward, prolonged time between arrival and clinical assessment, lack of awareness of the natural history of neutropenic fever syndromes and their evolution to severe sepsis or shock, failure of the emergency department to stock the appropriate antibacterial therapy, and neutropenic fever protocols not being readily available in the emergency department for quick reference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A systematic algorithm-driven approach to the febrile neutropenic patient who presents to an emergency department that includes the use of standardized order sets reduces the time from triage to antibiotic administration by up to two-thirds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24660668\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The febrile neutropenic patient who is developing a neutropenic <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/sepsis</span> syndrome may seek medical attention with nonspecific symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>] and may manifest muted signs of an inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In order to establish a diagnosis of neutropenic fever, the likelihood of the states of neutropenic fever must be ascertained. Laboratory confirmation of neutropenia may not be achievable in the recommended timeframe of one hour. Accordingly, the index of suspicion based upon limited patient history with or without vital signs must be raised very early in the triage process by taking a medical history. The risk of neutropenia, along with information obtained from basic vital signs, can be used to develop a management plan and administer initial empiric antibacterial therapy even before the results of basic laboratory investigations are available.

Although antibiotics are usually administered empirically, they should always include appropriate coverage for suspected or known infections.

Since the magnitude of the neutrophil-mediated component of the inflammatory response may be muted in neutropenic patients, a fever may be the earliest and only sign of infection. It is critical to recognize neutropenic fever early and to initiate empiric systemic antibacterial therapy promptly in order to avoid progression to a sepsis syndrome and possibly death. (See <a href=\"#H293581744\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever in neutropenic patients is defined as a single oral temperature of &gt;38.3&deg;C (101&deg;F) or a temperature of &gt;38.0&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) sustained for &gt;1 hour. (See <a href=\"#H278237232\" class=\"local\">'Fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe neutropenia is usually defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or an ANC that is expected to decrease to &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> over the next 48 hours (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-absolute-neutrophil-count\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). The risk of clinically important infection rises as the neutrophil count falls below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H981551211\" class=\"local\">'Neutropenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is crucial to assess the risk for serious complications in patients with neutropenic fever, since this assessment will dictate the approach to therapy, including the need for inpatient admission, intravenous antibiotics, and prolonged hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H477941076\" class=\"local\">'Risk of serious complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-risk patients with neutropenic fever are those in whom the duration of neutropenia (ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> is expected to be &le;7 days and those with no comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction. Most patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma are considered to be low risk. (See <a href=\"#H477941076\" class=\"local\">'Risk of serious complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We define high-risk patients with neutropenic fever as those who are expected to be neutropenic (ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> for &gt;7 days. Patients with neutropenic fever who have ongoing comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction are also considered to be high risk, regardless of the duration of neutropenia. Other criteria that confer a high-risk status can be found in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67027 \">table 1</a>). Profound prolonged neutropenia (ie, ANC &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> expected to last &gt;7 days) is most likely to occur in the preengraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT; particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H477941076\" class=\"local\">'Risk of serious complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infectious source is identified in approximately 20 to 30 percent of febrile neutropenic episodes. Often the only evidence of infection is bacteremia, which is documented in 10 to 25 percent of patients. Approximately 80 percent of identified infections are believed to arise from the patient's endogenous flora. Gram-positive bacteria are the most common causes of infection in neutropenic patients, but gram-negative bacteria (eg, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) are generally associated with the most serious infections. The Table lists the range of pathogens found in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63465 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9533703\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fungal pathogens are more common in high-risk patients with prolonged persistent or recrudescent neutropenic fever syndromes but are uncommon in low-risk patients. <em>Candida</em> and <em>Aspergillus </em>spp account for most invasive fungal infections during neutropenia. (See <a href=\"#H9533717\" class=\"local\">'Fungal pathogens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reliable method for obtaining body temperature must be used, and a mechanism for estimating the ANC is mandatory (see <a href=\"#H86779646\" class=\"local\">'Temperature measurement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H981551211\" class=\"local\">'Neutropenia'</a> above). The risk of neutropenia, the risk of complications from neutropenic fever, and the risk of sepsis must be assessed quickly.
