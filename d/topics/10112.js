In a large series from 1994, rectal bleeding was the chief complaint in 0.3 percent of more than 40,000 patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) in Massachusetts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bleeding was considered to be life-threatening in only four patients (4.2 percent), three of whom had ileocolic intussusception and one of whom had bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum. In a subsequent nationwide study, 11.6 percent of pediatric patients presenting to the ED with gastrointestinal bleeding were admitted to the hospital, suggesting that most cases presenting to the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding are not life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of the overall cases presenting to the ED were classified as LGIB, 20 percent were upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and the remainder were unspecified.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the evaluation of LGIB that presents with bright red blood per rectum, for which the most likely causes are organized by age group. The evaluation of children presenting with hematemesis or other signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children&quot;</a>). Many of the causes of LGIB that are listed here are discussed in detail in separate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper gastrointestinal bleeding</strong> (UGIB) refers to bleeding that originates from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract proximal to the ligament of Treitz (the junction of the duodenum and jejunum). It includes bleeding sources in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower gastrointestinal bleeding</strong> (LGIB) refers to bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz, and thus includes bleeding sources in the small bowel and colon. It is sometimes subcategorized as bleeding from the small bowel (sometimes termed mid-GI bleeding), or bleeding from the colon.</p><p/><p>Gastrointestinal bleeding can be further categorized based on qualitative characteristics of the stool:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematochezia</strong> describes the passage of bright red blood per rectum and usually suggests LGIB, typically from the colon or anus. Rarely, hematochezia can be caused by UGIB, due to rapid intestinal transit time or massive UGIB. (See <a href=\"#H631790574\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Melena</strong> describes stools that appear black and tar-like, and usually suggests UGIB. Melena may also be caused by blood from the nose that is swallowed or bleeding from the proximal small bowel. Black-appearing stools that do not contain blood may be caused by certain medications or foods. (See <a href=\"#H631790574\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Occult</strong> (hidden or unseen) GI bleeding is not visible to the patient or physician. It usually presents as iron deficiency anemia or is identified by testing the stool for occult blood. (See <a href=\"#H631791217\" class=\"local\">'Testing for blood in the stool'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The likely causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) vary depending upon age. In the United States, the most common causes of rectal bleeding in infants are anal fissure or cow's milk or soy protein-induced colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In children 12 months and older, the most common causes of rectal bleeding are infectious gastroenteritis and anal fissures. In each age group there are other disorders that are less common but important to identify because they may be life-threatening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> require specific treatment. The spectrum of causes is different in other parts of the world. In a report from India, for example, 24 percent of 85 children bled from amoebic ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In addition, various foods and medications may cause stool to falsely appear bloody or test positive for blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72978 \">table 1</a>), as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H631791217\" class=\"local\">'Testing for blood in the stool'</a> below.)</p><p>The following discussion will focus on the causes of bleeding most commonly seen in the United States during the neonatal period (younger than one month); infants and toddlers (one month to two years); preschool period (two to five years); and the school-age period or adolescence (older than five years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58363\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58363 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95764 \">table 2</a>). Many of the disorders are encountered in more than one of these age groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common diagnoses to consider in newborns presenting with LGIB are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swallowed maternal blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorectal fissures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotizing enterocolitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malrotation with midgut volvulus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hirschsprung disease with enterocolitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brisk upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular malformations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric or duodenal ulcer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal duplication cyst</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Swallowed maternal blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a newborn infant with rectal bleeding, the rectal blood should be tested to determine whether it comes from the infant or whether it represents maternal blood, which may have been swallowed during delivery or ingested during breast feeding from cracked nipples. This is accomplished using the Apt test (hemoglobin alkaline denaturation test), which detects fetal hemoglobin.</p><p>The Apt test takes advantage of the different susceptibilities of adult hemoglobin A (HbA) and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) to alkali denaturation. Infant HbF resists denaturation with alkali better than adult HbA. To perform the Apt test, fresh stool is mixed with water (1:5 dilution) and centrifuged, and sodium hydroxide then is added to the supernatant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Adult hemoglobin changes to brown-yellow within two minutes (alkaline hematin), while fetal hemoglobin resists denaturation and retains its pink color. Exposure of the stool sample to air for more than 30 minutes will cause fetal hemoglobin to have the same color change as adult hemoglobin, resulting in a false-positive result. In cases in which the Apt test is inconclusive, a spectrophotometric assay can be used to quantify the color change. HbF &gt;50 percent indicates fetal blood and HbF &lt;10 percent suggests maternal blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Anal fissures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal fissures are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in patients younger than one year and are also common in older children and adults. They are diagnosed easily by spreading the perineal skin to evert the anal canal. In an infant, the history often suggests painful defecation with straining, grunting, and leg stiffening or back arching consistent with withholding behavior and streaks of bright red blood on the surface of the stools. When associated with constipation, anal fissures usually respond to stool softeners and lubricants such as petrolatum (Vaseline). When associated with diarrhea, healing is hastened by keeping the perineum clean and dry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Vigorous wiping or the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerin</a> suppositories should be avoided because they may further irritate the anal mucosa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of acute constipation in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infants and children are more likely to develop constipation with associated risk for anal fissures during the following periods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The introduction of solid foods or cow's milk into the diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toilet training</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School entry</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Necrotizing enterocolitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acute illness of unclear etiology associated with intestinal necrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NEC should be suspected in a newborn with nonspecific systemic signs such as apnea, respiratory failure, lethargy, poor feeding, or temperature instability, and abdominal signs including distention, gastric retention (residual milk in the stomach before a feeding), tenderness, vomiting, diarrhea, and gross or occult LGIB. Although most infants who develop NEC were born prematurely, approximately 13 percent of cases occur in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The disease occurs predominantly in infants receiving enteral nutrition. Characteristic features in the supine abdominal radiograph are seen in most infants with suspected NEC. An abnormal gas pattern, with dilated loops of bowel consistent with ileus, is typically seen in the early stages. Pneumatosis intestinalis, the hallmark of NEC, appears as bubbles of gas in the bowel wall or in the portal system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Malrotation with midgut volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns who have malrotation with midgut volvulus typically present with abdominal distension, emesis which may or may not be bilious, and melena or hematochezia (in 10 to 20 percent of cases). Bilious emesis in the neonatal period should be assumed to represent a surgical emergency due to obstruction until proven otherwise.</p><p>Symptomatic malrotation is life-threatening and requires emergent evaluation and treatment. The diagnosis can be suggested by plain abdominal radiographs, but normal radiographs do not exclude it. A limited upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast series is the best examination to visualize the position of the duodenum; failure of the duodenum to cross the midline confirms the presence of malrotation. UGI contrast series should be performed whenever possible, under fluoroscopy and by an experienced pediatric radiologist. The addition of a small bowel follow-through or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema to check for colonic malrotation is prudent in patients in whom the UGI is normal but there is a high index of suspicion or signs of a distal bowel obstruction. Barium contrast studies may reveal a corkscrew appearance of the twisted small bowel, or a &quot;bird's peak&quot; if complete obstruction is present. The clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of malrotation are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In experienced hands, intestinal malrotation can be diagnosed by color Doppler ultrasonography. Malrotation is seen as inversion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) relationship, with the SMA on the right and SMV on the left, along with other findings such as duodenal dilatation with a tapering configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. A normal ultrasound, however, does not exclude malrotation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H3370939552\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Imaging in stable patients'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Hirschsprung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns with Hirschsprung disease frequently have delayed passage of meconium (&gt;48 hours after birth). Some present with acute obstruction manifested by vomiting (which may be bilious or feculent) and abdominal distension. Other infants may present at several weeks of age with progressive constipation or diarrhea associated with abdominal distension. Only one-quarter of the patients have blood in the stool. The diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease should also be suspected in older infants with chronic refractory constipation, such as those who need mechanical or pharmacologic assistance to defecate. The diagnosis also is suggested by explosive expulsion of gas and stool after the digital rectal examination (squirt sign or blast sign). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Significant blood in the stool with abdominal distension in infants with known or suspected Hirschsprung disease may be indicative of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (toxic megacolon) and should be considered a medical emergency. In this situation, the rectum needs to be immediately decompressed by either rectal exam <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the placement of a rectal tube, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a stable patient, a contrast enema may be used as an initial test; the study is performed &quot;unprepped&quot;, meaning that the stool should not be evacuated by enema or other means prior to the test. When diagnostic, the enema demonstrates marked dilation of the unaffected colon proximal to the aganglionic segment, which is smaller in comparison. Anorectal manometry (ARM) can be used for confirmatory testing if needed, and is also necessary to diagnose ultra-short segment Hirschsprung disease. In centers with expertise, ARM can be the initial diagnostic test, although it does not identify the extent of disease. The gold standard for diagnosis is the demonstration of complete absence of ganglion cells in the Meissner and the Auerbach plexus on a biopsy specimen of intestinal mucosa and submucosa. Treatment generally is surgical resection of the aganglionic segment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of coagulopathies can present during the newborn period. Most present with other bleeding symptoms, such as a large cephalohematoma after vaginal delivery, oozing from the umbilical stump, prolonged bleeding after circumcision or blood sampling, or intracranial hemorrhage in a term infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Occasionally, these coagulopathies come to medical attention because of LGIB, although this rarely occurs during the neonatal period.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin K deficient bleeding (previously known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn) &ndash; This disorder may occur in infants who do not receive vitamin K administration at birth; the risk is increased by maternal ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a>, or certain antibiotics and anticonvulsants. The disorder presents with cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and intracranial bleeding in neonates, typically developing within the first week of life. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Vitamin K deficient bleeding in newborns and young infants'</a>). Rarely, neonates with underlying disorders of fat absorption (eg, cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency) will present with GI bleeding related to vitamin K deficiency, although this typically presents after the newborn period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemophilia &ndash; About 25 percent of children with hemophilia present with a bleeding episode, and the remaining 75 percent are identified because of a family history of the disorder. Less than 5 percent of individuals present with bleeding in the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Hemophilia should be suspected in any male infant with an isolated prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Initial presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Von Willebrand disease &ndash; Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common disorder, but most individuals are asymptomatic. Presentation during the neonatal period or infancy is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of other congenital and acquired disorders of hemostasis present with bleeding symptoms. In most cases, there is evidence of bleeding from non-GI sources (eg, petechiae, mucocutaneous bleeding, or bruising) to suggest a disorder of coagulation.

It occurs almost exclusively in infants and usually resolves within 6 to 18 months of age. It can occur in infants who are formula-fed, or less commonly in breast-fed infants because of cow's milk in the mother's diet. Affected infants have loose stools, often with occult or gross blood, but are otherwise healthy. Although cow's milk is the most common trigger in Western populations, up to 25 percent of patients with cow's milk protein intolerance will have a cross-reaction to soy protein, and a few infants are sensitive to other food proteins. Thus, the general term for these disorders is &quot;food protein-induced colitis.&quot; Treatment involves meticulous elimination of the causative protein from the mother's diet if the infant is breastfed, or the use of a casein-hydrolysate formula. About 10 percent of infants are sensitive to the casein-hydrolysate formula and require an amino acid-based formula. The intolerance usually resolves by 18 months of age, at which time an unrestricted diet can be resumed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Food protein-induced enteropathy and enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) are separate but related disorders, in which vomiting rather than rectal bleeding is the prominent feature, and infants are generally ill-appearing and more symptomatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Intussusception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants between 6 and 36 months of age. Approximately 60 percent of affected children are younger than one year old, and 80 percent are younger than two years. In this age group, intussusception usually is idiopathic and occurs in the ileocecal region, in contrast to older children in whom a polyp or Meckel's diverticulum or other lesions often serve as a lead point. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of intussusception are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intussusception-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intussusception in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients may awaken from sleep with severe abdominal pain, which causes them to be irritable and draw up their legs. They vomit and may pass a stool and improve temporarily before the cycle repeats. Eventually, patients become apathetic and pale, and may pass a bloody, mucoid stool. A sausage-shaped mass in the distribution of the colon, typically in the area of the transverse colon, may occasionally be palpable on abdominal examination. The stool contains gross or occult blood in most but not all cases, and sometimes has the appearance of &quot;currant jelly.&quot;</p><p>Ultrasonography is the method of choice to detect intussusception in most institutions. The diagnosis can also be established with an air or water-soluble contrast enema, which also can treat (&quot;reduce&quot;) the intussusception in 75 to 90 percent of children in whom a lead point is not present. The choice of procedure varies with the experience of the radiologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Meckel's diverticulum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meckel's diverticulum results from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct. It is usually asymptomatic, but may cause painless rectal bleeding, which may be chronic and insidious, or acute and massive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The bleeding is often caused by mucosal ulceration of adjacent small bowel tissue due to production of acid by ectopic gastric tissue within the diverticulum. Other complications associated with a Meckel's diverticulum are obstruction, perforation, diverticulitis, and intussusception. Sixty percent of pediatric patients having complications from a Meckel's diverticulum are younger than two years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meckels-diverticulum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meckel's diverticulum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The &quot;rule of twos&quot; is used to describe the epidemiology of Meckel's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]: it occurs in two percent of the population with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1, is found within two feet of the ileocecal valve, involves two types of tissue (gastric and intestinal epithelium), and is two inches long. Approximately 2 percent of individuals with a Meckel's diverticulum develop a complication over the course of their lives.

The peak incidence of IBD is in late adolescence and early adulthood, but a significant number of children present prior to adolescence and children may present even before five years of age.

GIST have been reported more frequently over the course of a patient's lifetime in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), but in this condition they tend to have a more benign course and can be located in the small intestine rather than in the stomach.

Sepsis should be considered in those with fever or conditions that predispose to infection. Laboratory tests for hemodynamically unstable patients include a complete blood count (CBC), routine chemistries, coagulation studies, and blood type and crossmatch (in case transfusion will be needed). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypovolemic shock in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic shock in children: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is it blood?</strong> &ndash; In most cases, the clinician should examine the stool directly and test it for blood. This is because several foods and medicines may give stool a bloody appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72978 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H631791217\" class=\"local\">'Testing for blood in the stool'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is the blood from the lower GI tract?</strong> &ndash; Red blood found in a child's stool is most often from the anus or lower gastrointestinal tract, but occasionally has an upper gastrointestinal source. The appearance of the bloody stool helps to distinguish between these possibilities:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematochezia (the passage of bright red blood per rectum) usually suggests LGIB, and is typically from the colon or anus. Rarely, hematochezia can be caused by upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), especially in an infant or other individual with rapid intestinal transit time, or because of a massive UGIB in an older individual. Thus, the possibility of UGIB should be considered in an individual with hematochezia and hemodynamic compromise, or in a child with risk factors for UGIB, such as underlying liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Melena (black, tarry stools) usually suggests UGIB. It also may be caused by blood from the nose that is swallowed, or bleeding from the proximal small bowel (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children&quot;</a>). Black-appearing stools also may be caused by certain medications (eg, bismuth or iron), or foods (large amounts of dark green leafy vegetables). These black stools can be distinguished from melena by testing the stool for blood. (See <a href=\"#H631791217\" class=\"local\">'Testing for blood in the stool'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What are the most likely causes of the LGIB in this patient? </strong>The diagnostic possibilities depend on the patient's age and individual characteristics, assessed by a focused history and physical examination, as summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95764 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H631791274\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> below and <a href=\"#H631791567\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>This information permits selection of specific tests to diagnose or exclude the likely disorders, which are organized above by the typical age group in which each tends to appear.

This is because several foods and medicines may give stool a bloody appearance that may be misinterpreted by the child or their parent(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72978 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Red-colored stools resembling hematochezia may be caused by foods with red dyes (eg, Kool-Aid or fruit punch), beets, red licorice, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rifampin</a>. Black-colored stools resembling melena may be caused by ingestion of bismuth, activated charcoal, or iron, and occasionally by consumption of large quantities of chocolate, blueberries, or dark green foods. Testing is particularly important in children with equivocal symptoms, such as a well-appearing child with small amounts of red material in the stool.</p><p>The most common assays can be performed at the bedside and are guaiac-based. This test identifies hemoglobin by the presence of a peroxidase reaction that turns guaiac-impregnated paper blue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Occasionally, false-positive results may occur if the patient has ingested rare red meat or peroxidase-containing vegetables (such as turnips, horseradish, broccoli, cauliflower, and cantaloupe). Whether iron supplements cause false-positive results is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. False negative results can be obtained if the patient is ingesting large doses of ascorbic acid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin C</a>) or if intestinal bacteria have degraded the hemoglobin to porphyrin.</p><p>Patients with positive guaiac tests that are thought to be possible false-positives can be further evaluated with non-guaiac-based tests, which are based on measurement of fecal hemoglobin or fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin. The sensitivity of the test for fecal hemoglobin is limited because of degradation of hemoglobin by fecal bacteria, and the overall sensitivity and specificity are similar to the guaiac test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin is used primarily to diagnose enteric protein loss, but it is also elevated in patients with gastrointestinal blood loss (upper or lower), in whom it has a sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 90 percent, compared with 68 and 73 percent, respectively, of the guaiac test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin test can be used in patients with recurrent red stools that are guaiac-negative or in those with a possible false-positive guaiac test result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H631791274\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the presenting complaint is rectal bleeding, details about the symptom should be sought:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration and amount of bleeding &ndash; The patient or family can estimate the amount of blood, but this is often inaccurate. Asking whether there is enough blood to color the toilet water, if so how red, and if clots are present, can help to convey the amount of bleeding observed. Note that very small amounts of blood, even a few drops, will color the toilet water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color of the blood &ndash; Bright red blood is most consistent with a lower gastrointestinal source, hemorrhoid, or anal fissure. However, UGIB should be considered in infants or any child with evidence of hemodynamic instability or with risk factors for UGI bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H631790574\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistency of accompanying stool &ndash; Accompanying diarrhea suggests the possibility of colitis (eg, food protein-induced colitis in an infant, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) or immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]) in a young child, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in older children and adolescents, or infectious colitis in all age groups). Acute or intermittent constipation suggests the possibility of anal fissures or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS). The degree of constipation is often under-estimated by children and their caretakers, so it is valuable to seek additional details about constipation-related symptoms such as pain while defecating, time spent on the toilet, withholding behavior, size of stools, and whether they plug the toilet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal bleeding &ndash; Several characteristics suggest that the blood is most likely from an anorectal source such as an anal fissure, hemorrhoid, or polyp. These include blood that is primarily on the outside of a formed stool, blood that is mostly seen on the toilet paper rather than in the stool, or that drips into the toilet after the bowel movement (sometimes called &quot;terminal bleeding&quot;).</p><p/><p>A history of associated symptoms should be specifically sought, even if the child is generally well-appearing.

For example, a child with an underlying immunodeficiency is particularly at risk for infectious colitis or neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis). A child with underlying liver disease may develop variceal bleeding (causing UGIB or LGIB) or coagulopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H631791567\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to evaluate the child's hemodynamic stability, by measuring vital signs and assessing for signs of shock, including tachycardia, hypotension or orthostasis, poor capillary refill and altered sensorium. Sepsis should be considered in those with fever or conditions that predispose to infection. Bowel obstruction is suggested by marked abdominal pain and distension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bilious or nonbilious vomiting. Children with evidence of shock, sepsis, or abdominal obstruction should be treated promptly with fluid resuscitation and other measures, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypovolemic shock in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic shock in children: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;, section on 'Signs of obstruction or peritoneal irritation'</a>.)</p><p>For stable patients, the physical examination should investigate potential sites of bleeding. In particular, the anus should be carefully inspected for fissures in all age groups by very gently spreading each fold of the anus. Other features to note in the perianal area include large skin tags or fistulas, both of which suggest the possibility of IBD (Crohn disease [CD]) (see <a href=\"#H17730768\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory bowel disease'</a> above). A rectal examination is important to evaluate for rectal polyps (but does not rule out this condition) and to obtain stool for guaiac testing. In young infants or children with a history of constipation (especially in those without associated encopresis), the possibility of Hirschsprung disease is suggested by an explosive expulsion of gas and stool after the digital rectal examination (squirt sign or blast sign). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hirschsprung disease'</a> above.)</p><p>The nasopharynx and oropharynx should be inspected. Recent nosebleeds can mimic gastrointestinal bleeding. CD is often associated with aphthous ulcers in the mouth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H17730768\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory bowel disease'</a> above.)</p><p>The skin should be inspected for bruising, petechiae or other rashes, which suggest abnormal hemostasis, as may be seen in HUS. Palpable purpura suggests a vasculitis, such as IgAV (HSP). The presence of cutaneous hemangiomas (especially five or more) in an infant suggests the possibility of gastrointestinal hemangiomatosis. However, up to 50 percent of infants with visceral hemangiomas do not have cutaneous hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Jaundice suggests hepatic failure or biliary obstruction, especially if significant. The abdominal examination should evaluate for hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or other signs of portal hypertension (ascites, prominent superficial veins), masses, tenderness, abnormal bowel sounds, and for evidence of underlying peritonitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H631791605\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies and imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and children presenting with significant rectal bleeding should be evaluated for anemia. Patients with identifiable sources of minor bleeding such as a fissure or viral gastroenteritis may not require laboratory testing.</p><p>More extensive laboratory testing is appropriate for those who are not well-appearing, or who have symptoms or signs suggestive of a particular disorder. As an example, for children with suspected colitis (infectious colitis or IBD), the evaluation includes an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin and complete blood count (CBC), and stool testing for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), enteric pathogens, ova and parasites (O&amp;P), and possibly fecal lactoferrin and fecal calprotectin.

Patients with concern for HUS should also undergo serial evaluation of CBC and renal function.

In most cases, the clinician should examine the stool directly and test it for blood. This is because several foods and medicines may give stool a bloody appearance that may be misinterpreted by the child's parents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72978 \">table 1</a>). Testing the stool for blood is particularly important in children with equivocal symptoms, such as a well-appearing child with small amounts of red material in the stool. (See <a href=\"#H631791217\" class=\"local\">'Testing for blood in the stool'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic possibilities depend on the patient's age group and are then narrowed using a focused history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95763\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95763 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95764 \">table 2</a>). A complete blood count (CBC) or hemoglobin should be measured in patients who are unwell or who have more than minimal bleeding. Other laboratory tests or imaging are added to diagnose or exclude specific causes. (See <a href=\"#H631790574\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anal fissures are a common cause of low-volume rectal bleeding in all age groups. They are often triggered by constipation, which is more common during periods of dietary change (introduction of solid food or cow's milk), toilet training, or around school entry. In older children, anal fissures also may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Anal fissures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk or soy-induced colitis is a common cause of bloody stools in infants and usually resolves by 12 months of age. It can occur in infants who are formula-fed, or in breastfed infants because of cow's milk in the mother's diet. Affected infants have loose stools, often with occult or gross blood, but are usually otherwise healthy. It should be differentiated from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, a benign self-resolving condition. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Milk- or soy-induced colitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meckel's diverticulum is usually asymptomatic, but may cause painless rectal bleeding, which may be chronic and insidious, or acute and massive. It can present at any age, but is most common in children under two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Meckel's diverticulum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of rectal bleeding that present as acute abdominal crisis include malrotation with midgut volvulus (usually in newborn infants but may be seen in children of any age); Hirschsprung disease complicated by obstruction (usually in newborns) or by Hirschsprung disease-associated enterocolitis (usually in infants or those with known Hirschsprung disease); or intussusception (usually in infants or preschool aged children). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Malrotation with midgut volvulus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hirschsprung disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Intussusception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Juvenile polyps are benign hamartomas, which typically occur between the ages of 2 and 10 years, with a peak at 3 to 4 years. Patients usually present with painless rectal bleeding, although a few may have lower abdominal pain from traction on the polyp. Most polyps in children are solitary and benign, but children with multiple polyps may have a polyposis syndrome and require surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), most commonly presents with abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, growth failure, and bloody or nonbloody diarrhea. The peak incidence of IBD is in late adolescence and early adulthood, but a significant number of children present prior to adolescence, and IBD is occasionally diagnosed in very young children. The diagnosis usually is suspected by the chronicity of symptoms and weight loss or growth failure, especially in those with CD. Many patients have iron deficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). (See <a href=\"#H17730768\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory bowel disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H608943329\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Chris Ramsook, MD, and Erin E Endom, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Teach SJ, Fleisher GR.
