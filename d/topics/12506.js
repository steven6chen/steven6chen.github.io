Treated as diseases, both intentional and unintentional injuries are cured by prevention. The clinician's role in injury prevention includes education, instruction, and even advocating for changes to improve child safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Pediatric injuries are such a significant health care problem that major authorities, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the US Preventive Services Task Force, have issued recommendations that injury prevention counseling be provided as a part of the well-child exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>].

In addition to the financial burden, injuries lead to emotional trauma for children, parents, and society.</p><p>Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death and disability for children &ge;1 year of age, adolescents, and young adults in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67131\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67131 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In 2015, unintentional injuries resulted in the deaths of more than 16,500 children, adolescents, and young adults ages 0 to 24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Unintentional injury deaths peak in the &lt;1 year old age group, and again during adolescence and young adulthood (ages 15 to 24) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81602 \">table 2</a>). Primary mechanisms of injury are development- and age-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Each year in the United States, more than 13 million children and young adults younger than 24 years old are injured seriously enough to require a visit to a hospital emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unintentional falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injury in children presenting to hospital emergency departments in the United States, followed by being struck by or against an object (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65440 \">table 3</a>). In a population-based study of injury among 96,359 Canadian children (0 to 10 years of age) for which any medical attention was sought, the types and severity of injuries range from superficial injuries and contusions to multiple fractures and increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The most common injuries were open wounds; superficial injuries and contusions; and dislocations, sprains, and strains, followed by upper-limb fractures; intracranial injury; foreign body; burns; and poisoning. Fractures are the leading cause of injury hospitalization for children under 18 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There are significant <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> disparities in injury-related mortality. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of childhood fatal injury data for 1999 to 2002 showed disparities that varied by age and mechanism of injury. Hispanics and <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders had lower risk, whereas American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indian/Alaska</span> Natives and black children had higher risk for fatal injuries than other <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Racial/ethnic</span> disparities vary by age and setting. For example, a CDC analysis of drowning data from 1999 to 2010 revealed that drowning rates among black children 5 to 19 years old in swimming pools was 5.5 times higher than for whites of the same age, but at ages 11 to 12 years, the drowning rate among black children was 10 times that for whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>According to data from the CDC, the lifetime medical cost (ie, treatment and rehabilitation) of unintentional injury among children ages 19 and younger is over $77 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The total work loss cost (ie, lost wages, benefits, and self-provided household services) is approximately $12 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Worldwide unintentional injury accounts for 12 percent of the years lost due to disabilities among young people age 10 to 24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Historical trends in pediatric injury control reveal the effectiveness of certain prevention activities. Between 2000 and 2009, the unintentional injury death rate for children ages 19 and younger declined by 29 percent in the United States (from 15.5 to 11.0 per 100,000) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83770 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In 2015, the unintentional-injury death rate per 100,000 for children 19 years and younger was 9.6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reduction in mortality can be attributed to the increased use of seat belts and child safety seats, the reduction in drunk driving, the increased use of child-resistant packaging, better safety awareness, and improved medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>].</p><p>Numerous reliable sources provide injury statistics.

Infants are more likely to sustain fatal injuries from suffocation, motor vehicle crashes, drowning, and burns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81602 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Toddlers and preschool children are more likely to die from drowning, motor vehicle collisions, fires and burns, and suffocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Children at this age lack the motor skills to maneuver and the cognitive skills necessary to recognize safety hazards. The school-age child is more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors that lead to pedestrian injuries, bicycle injuries, drowning, and unintentional firearm injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Motor vehicle occupant injury continues to be the most significant mechanism of injury for this age group, as well as for the adolescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Adolescents also are at risk for poisonings, drowning, firearm injury, falls, burns, and intentional injury. Data from the National Vital Statistics System indicate that between 2000 and 2009, an increased misuse of prescription drugs contributed to an increase in unintentional poisoning deaths among adolescents 15 to 19 years of age (from 1.7 to 3.3 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The NCIPC works with other federal agencies and funds research for injury prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Increased research has led to new knowledge and strategies for the prevention and control of childhood injures. Injury prevention has become recognized as a field of science with its own theoretical framework and body of research. One well-accepted model of injury prevention, the Haddon Injury Control Model, proposes that all injuries are attributable to five forms of energy (kinetic, chemical, thermal, electrical, and radiation) and that injuries result when energy emanating from a vehicle or agent source is transferred to the host or child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Countermeasure strategies can modify the potential or severity of energy transferred to the host or child and thereby prevent or diminish injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Examples of countermeasure strategies are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the amount of energy produced &ndash; Reduce the temperature of the hot water heater</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent the release of energy &ndash; Trigger locks to prevent discharge of the gun</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modify the rate of spatial distribution of the energy release &ndash; Reduce the slope of ski trails</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate the energy and the host in space or time &ndash; Build sidewalks for pedestrians and bike paths for bicyclists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate the energy and the host via barriers &ndash; Use bike helmets or safety glasses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modify the contact surface &ndash; Soften the playground surface</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strengthen the structure that receives the energy &ndash; Train athletes with appropriate conditioning and stretching</p><p/><p>Based upon the matrix of event phases and epidemiologic factors for injury prevention, 12 possible areas for injury-modifying interventions exist in the Haddon model (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62985\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef62985 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>An injury event is divided into three phases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-event phase &ndash; Production or release of the energy has yet to occur and is modifiable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Event phase &ndash; Release of the energy has occurred, but potential transfer to the host is modifiable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-event phase &ndash; Energy has been transferred, but the extent of damage is modifiable</p><p/><p>Epidemiologic factors in injury prevention include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host &ndash; Human body that is affected by energy transfer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vehicle or agent &ndash; That which carries or transfers energy (eg, mechanisms of injury)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical environment &ndash; Changes to the environment that physically affect the impact of any of the three injury phases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sociocultural and political environment &ndash; Attitudinal, legal, regulatory, or other changes that can affect the three injury phases</p><p/><p>The advent of this model brought the realization that 90 percent of injuries are both predictable and preventable, and, for that reason, experts in the field no longer use the term &quot;accident&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>]. The principles of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies (eg, education, product design, and modification of the environment) can be used to develop interventions to prevent or control injury.</p><p>Injury prevention strategies are active or passive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Passive interventions (eg, automatic seat belts or air bags) are more effective than are active interventions (eg, manual seat belts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, certain mechanisms of injury have not lent themselves to passive interventions. Child safety seats, for example, are an active intervention. Adults must purchase and install them and then ensure that the child is appropriately secured in the seat each time the car is driven. Despite these encumbrances, evidence shows that the frequency of safety seat use increases with the implementation of child safety seat laws, enhanced enforcement campaigns, community-wide information distribution, and interventions that combine giving incentives or distribution of free safety seats with educational efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Another model for conceptualizing the potential impact of pediatric injury prevention interventions is the Health Impact Pyramid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this model, the lower tier interventions (at the base of the pyramid) have greater population impact and require less individual effort; the higher tier interventions have less population impact and require more individual effort:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tier 1 &ndash; Socioeconomic factors (eg, poverty reduction, improved education)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tier 2 &ndash; Changing the environmental context to encourage healthy decisions (eg, improved road and vehicle safety)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tier 3 &ndash; Long-lasting protective interventions (eg, car seat loaner programs, smoke detector installation programs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tier 4 &ndash; Clinical interventions (eg, clinic-based car seat or bicycle helmet inspection for proper fit and use)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tier 5 &ndash; Counseling and education (eg, counseling to wear seat belts, provision of patient education handouts, such as &quot;The Injury Prevention Program&quot; handouts from the American Academy of Pediatrics) (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Injury prevention resources'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INCORPORATING INJURY PREVENTION INTO PRACTICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Office-based or outpatient injury prevention counseling is an integral part of medical care for infants, children, and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that every well-child visit include age-appropriate injury prevention counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>].</p><p>Parental education appears to be helpful in reducing injuries and improving home safety, particularly in families from disadvantaged populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]. In a 2013 meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials (5074 participants), parenting interventions decreased the risk of medically attended unintentional injury (relative risk 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. There was also fairly consistent evidence that parental interventions improved home safety.</p><p>However, integrating injury-counseling practices during the average 16-minute well-child visit can be problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a survey conducted during 2001 to 2003, only 42 percent of the children younger than 15 years of age who had a medical visit in the previous year received any injury prevention information, according to a random-digit-dial telephone survey of 2541 households [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another survey, 55 percent of clinicians responded that they provided injury prevention counseling always or most of the time, yet only 19 percent of their patients recalled receiving any safety information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Pediatricians report concerns of adequate time, perceived self-efficacy, perceived effectiveness of counseling, and reimbursement for counseling as barriers to counseling practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. These concerns are not without merit.

A 2016 systematic review found inconclusive evidence for school-based education injury prevention programs, primarily due to poor quality of the research measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, evidence indicates that the most successful and effective interventions tend to combine all three strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Pediatric clinicians can help effect change by advocating at the federal, state, or community level.

Managed-care companies have an interest in keeping their clients healthy and their costs down. Interventions that meet both goals should be considered in capitation analysis. Philosophic concerns about societal costs and burdens also can be problematic for the health care practitioner. One study estimated that injury prevention counseling for patients between the ages of zero and four years would result in a lifetime savings of $800 per child in future medical spending on injury treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INJURY PREVENTION RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of office resources (eg, chart aids, educational materials) was an important factor in the provision of preventive care, according to a survey of randomly selected members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

More information about the program is available <a href=\"http://patiented.solutions.aap.org/DocumentLibrary/A+Guide+to+Safety+Counseling+in+Office+Practice.pdf&amp;token=+dxJ8UmLDbcx+Muu88k9rd1uWnnmecId+SWj071wKjdb0Evl5wEqz0QtVagqAC4gCTN6omIPk4wKF9JxSN4WrKP0kwLj3LfSHbfUuA+5UF2oDcoxT5eY8c0npflLcQ/8d00uixQYH7R2/lX/4nqIYg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online</a>. The program offers safety surveys and age-specific safety information sheets to be given to parents and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The surveys identify areas of specific individual risk, which can direct the counseling. Although some authors argue about the efficacy of these tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], the interventions do help to prioritize the delivery of safety counseling and aid in the development of a comprehensive and organized approach to injury prevention.
