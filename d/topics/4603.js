Of these, the AV fistula is preferred for long-term hemodialysis vascular access since it has the best long-term primary patency rate, requires the fewest interventions of any type of access, and, most importantly, is associated with the lowest incidence of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. </p><p>The creation of native AV fistulas for hemodialysis and their complications are reviewed here. An overview of the different types of chronic hemodialysis access is presented separately.

However, the temptation to create an AV fistula to satisfy the fistula-first initiative in patients with inadequate vessels should be resisted. Overly aggressive attempts to increase AV fistula prevalence in patients with suboptimal anatomy leads to reduced maturation rates and a longer duration of dialysis catheter use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The benefits of AV fistulas over other forms of chronic access are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All types of AV fistulas possess similar characteristics. These include the following (see <a href=\"#H1761013269\" class=\"local\">'Types by anatomic location'</a> below): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increase in arterial and venous blood flow with time, which has the potential for causing cardiac overload in susceptible patients. The diameter and flow within the associated artery also increases with an abrupt initial increase at the time of fistula creation and a continued gradual increase thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These alterations in flow can also lead to distal extremity ischemia. Steal is more likely in patients undergoing brachial-based AV fistulas compared with radial artery-based fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1625268919\" class=\"local\">'Ischemia and other systemic problems'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV fistula increases in diameter with time, which may cause cosmetic concern on the part of the patient. The fistula may also undergo aneurysmal degeneration over time. (See <a href=\"#H288792103\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm/megafistula'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Requirements for AV fistula use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal is to create an accessible vascular structure with sufficient blood flow that can be cannulated repeatedly to permit adequate dialysis. Several characteristics must be present for an AV fistula to be usable. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV fistula must be accessible with the patient in a sitting position.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the forearm, the AV fistula should be on the volar surface.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the upper arm, the AV fistula should be on the anterior or lateral surface. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV fistula must be able to be reliably cannulated repeatedly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV fistula should be within 5 to 6 mm of the skin surface.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relatively straight segment 8 to 10 cm long needs to be available for cannulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood flow must be adequate to support the dialysis prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1238670066\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An adequate evaluation of the predialysis patient with chronic kidney disease enhances the opportunity to place a functioning arteriovenous (AV) fistula. A detailed medical history should be obtained to evaluate for risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula failure&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2392537285\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination can often identify anatomy suitable for the creation of an AV fistula, but we suggest duplex ultrasound to evaluate the arterial and venous anatomy rather than relying on physical examination alone. The importance of vascular mapping in attaining the goal of an optimum vascular access cannot be overstated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is critical that all of the various sites that could be used for AV fistula creation on the basis of normal and variant anatomy are evaluated. However, clinical judgment and physical exam findings would override any findings on imaging that are contradictory. Patient evaluation and vascular mapping prior to placement of hemodialysis AV access is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and vascular mapping prior to placement of hemodialysis arteriovenous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When planning the creation of an AV fistula, attention should be directed to the nondominant arm first. While the patient is on dialysis, having the dominant hand free allows the patient to engage in desired activities more easily. However, if the nondominant arm is not suitable for AV fistula creation, the dominant arm should be evaluated. In most patients, only after determining that conditions are not suitable for an AV fistula should an AV graft be considered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4176817334\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of AV fistula creation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to realize that it takes time to arrive at a successful AV fistula. There are a number of events that must take place, including referral to surgery, surgical evaluation, scheduling for surgery, a period of maturation, and the possibility of a need for a salvage procedure to achieve usability, which may be followed by another waiting period before it is finally declared suitable for use. Each of these events takes time. This sequence has been referred to as the &quot;fistula hurdles.&quot; During this sequence, the patient falls into one of two categories: (1) continuing dialysis with a catheter, or (2) the risk of having to start dialysis with a catheter. Either of these is undesirable. </p><p>The minimum time for AV fistula maturation is one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but a lead time of 6 to 12 months is recommended since intervention may be required to facilitate maturation of AV fistulas, particularly for patients with small vessels below the accepted thresholds for access creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maturation-and-evaluation-of-the-newly-created-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maturation and evaluation of the newly created hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention#H2422681642\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula maintenance and thrombosis prevention&quot;, section on 'Inspection prior to initial cannulation'</a>.) </p><p>In one study, AV fistulas created at least four months prior to starting hemodialysis were associated with a lower risk of sepsis and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Much of the benefit was explained by the avoidance of central venous catheters. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>According to one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], within a cohort of 78 patients who started dialysis with a tunneled catheter, it was observed that the likelihood of using a permanent access was 53 percent by six months and only 80 percent by one year. In patients with both a catheter and an immature access, 50 percent were using their permanent access at three months and 80 percent at six months. Of patients using a catheter with access surgery pending, 45 percent had access surgery performed within three months and only 70 percent at six months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is well documented that patients who see a nephrologist prior to the need for dialysis have a better chance of starting dialysis with an AV fistula as a permanent access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, even when patients are referred to a nephrologist prior to their need, they frequently incur a delay in having a permanent AV access placed and require catheter-based dialysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, it was shown that patients referred within one month of initiating hemodialysis therapy used a dialysis catheter for a median of 202 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For patients referred within one to four months, it was 64 days; within 4 to 12 months, the time was 67 days; and with referral greater than 12 months before initiating hemodialysis therapy, catheter use was still for a median of 19 days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 157 patients initiating dialysis therapy, a total of 73.2 percent had predialysis follow-up by a nephrologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of these, only 46.5 percent had predialysis vascular access surgery, and only 35 percent initiated their first dialysis session with a permanent access.</p><p/><p>Access planning is a complex issue with a number of problems that must be addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is very clear that there is a need for an improved algorithm relating declining renal function and timing of the referral for access placement. Creating the AV fistula well before it is required for dialysis allows adequate maturation to take place prior to use and avoids the need for a dialysis catheter. Since there is no disadvantage to creating an AV fistula too early (not true for grafts), the patient should be sent to the surgeon well before the time of anticipated need. The question remains, however, as to when planning should begin. </p><p>Fistula creation at least four months before starting chronic hemodialysis has been shown to be associated with the lowest risk of sepsis and death from the use of hemodialysis catheters. In this retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV fistulas or AV grafts created at least four months before starting hemodialysis were defined as Early creations (n = 1240).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accesses created between four months and one month before starting hemodialysis were defined as Just Prior creations (n = 997).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accesses created within one month of starting dialysis or after were defined as Late creations (n = 3687).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis catheter use was defined as insertion, removal, or manipulation of a catheter before the occurrence of sepsis.</p><p/><p>Eighty percent of accesses were AV fistulas. Early access creation was associated with a decreased risk of sepsis compared with late access creation, with catheter use increasing the risk of sepsis by 1.41. Early access creation was also associated with lower mortality. Catheter use and sepsis independently increased mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1761013269\"><span class=\"h2\">Types by anatomic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of AV fistula should be referred to by the specific artery and vein that are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The vascular anatomy of the upper extremity is illustrated in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55596%7ESURG%2F61941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55596 graphicRef61941 \">figure 1A-B</a>). </p><p>Although a variety of different anatomic types of AV fistula can be created, most AV fistulas fall within three basic types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radial-cephalic, which is the radial artery and the cephalic vein at the wrist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brachial-cephalic, which is the brachial artery and the cephalic vein in the proximal forearm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brachial-basilic, which is the brachial artery and the basilic vein in the upper arm</p><p/><p>Although the radial-cephalic AV fistula has a lower blood flow rate than is possible with more proximal AV fistulas, its use as the first access preserves the more proximal arm vessels for later access attempts, as needed. </p><p>The brachial-cephalic fistula is created by anastomosing the upper arm cephalic vein to the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa or just above the elbow. Because of the lateral and relatively superficial location of the cephalic vein, the brachial-cephalic fistula is easy to cannulate. It also provides a long length of straight vein from which to select cannulation sites. In cases of obese patients or patients in which the cephalic vein is deeper than 5 to 6 mm from the skin, the brachial-cephalic fistula may require superficialization to make it possible to be cannulated. This more proximal access has the potential for a higher blood flow than the radial-cephalic fistula but also has a slightly higher incidence of vascular steal syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H12722337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Extremity ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>The brachial-basilic fistula (basilic vein transposition) requires a more extensive operation to create. The basilic vein lies on the inner surface of the forearm in the median bicipital sulcus. It continues proximally to the middle third of the sulcus, at which point it pierces the brachial fascia to run in a deeper plane. Thus, the vein must be elevated and transposed to make it usable as a hemodialysis access. The basilic vein is dissected free from its bed by ligating and dividing all tributaries to the point where it joins the brachial vein to form the axillary vein in the upper arm. The basilic vein is then transposed to a more superficial location to move it from its medial position to a more lateral location that is accessible for dialysis. The brachial-basilic fistula can be created as a one-stage procedure or in two stages. In the one-stage procedure, the brachial-basilic anastomosis and the basilic vein superficialization are performed in the same operation. In the two-stage procedure, the brachial-basilic anastomosis is created in the first operation and the fistula is allowed to mature for four to six weeks. A second operation is then performed to superficialize the brachial-basilic fistula. In the literature, there appears to be no difference in maturation and patency rates among the one- and two-stage approach. However, there is some indication that the two-stage approach is more successful in patients with smaller basilic veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The brachial-basilic AV fistula is associated with more morbidity related to its creation. However, because the basilic vein is more deeply positioned and therefore less accessible for venipuncture under normal circumstances, it tends to be better preserved and less involved with postphlebitic changes compared with the cephalic vein.</p><p>The basilic vein is shorter than the cephalic vein, especially if its confluence with the brachial vein is low in the upper arm. Under this circumstance, there is less potential cannulation length with which to work. This shorter length, along with its more medial location, makes the brachial-basilic fistula somewhat more difficult to cannulate.</p><p>Steal syndrome tends to be more common for brachial artery-based fistulas. This may in part be related to their larger size. In addition, the basilic vein access tends to be used primarily in patients who have had multiple prior failed access procedures. These patients, as a group, tend to have a higher incidence of arteriosclerotic arterial disease, making them more susceptible to steal.

We agree with this ranking. The 2008 Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines also state that a radial-cephalic access is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The order of preference is based upon the following rationale, which emphasizes ease of construction and minimization of patient morbidity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach of starting distally allows the preservation of more proximal veins for later use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ranking order takes into account the ease of access creation and the degree of patient morbidity involved. Cephalic-based fistulas are more easily created, whether in the forearm or the upper arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular steal is more common in patients with more proximal (brachial artery-based) compared with distal (radial artery-based) fistulas as noted in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Reports of the use of the proximal radial artery as the inflow vessel in the creation of a &quot;middle-arm&quot; fistula have shown excellent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The proximal radial artery is positioned anteriorly and can be mobilized easily to create a tension-free anastomosis with the median antebrachial vein. The initial retrograde valve is ruptured during the operation by placing a vascular probe through the valve, thus rendering the proximal radial-median antebrachial fistula bidirectional, allowing for cannulation in both the forearm and upper arm. It also has less risk of steal syndrome compared with fistulas created using the brachial artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and provides superior results in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and patients with a difficult access arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The suitability of the median-antebrachial vein may be contributed to in part by the fact that it is not commonly accessed for routine blood draws by venipuncturists. The reported results with this fistula make it apparent that it should be included on the list of preferred fistula types. </p><p>If it is not possible to create one of the basic types of AV fistula, then all reasonable attempts at creating a transposed fistula should be exhausted before consideration is given to the insertion of an AV graft. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295627642\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arteriovenous (AV) fistulas can generally be created quickly with minimal patient morbidity</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235134130\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for anesthesia at the time of AV fistula creation include general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or local anesthesia. Avoiding general anesthesia may be desirable in this population, and, under most circumstances, AV fistula creation can be accomplished using regional or local anesthesia with or without intravenous sedation. Based upon the results of one trial, we suggest brachial plexus block rather than local anesthesia alone for the creation of AV fistulas. Regional anesthesia causes arterial and venous dilation and may improve fistula patency. However, potential improvements in fistula patency need to be weighed against the risks associated with brachial plexus block, which may be reduced using ultrasound guidance.

Although the downstream or proximal end of the vein is left intact, the tributaries to the distal portion are divided and ligated to allow the vein to be moved to a position that will facilitate ease of cannulation when the fistula is used for hemodialysis. This requires the creation of a tunnel or pocket to serve as a bed for the positioned vein. This is occasionally performed in a two-stage operation.

The construction of a vein translocation fistula is similar to the placement of an AV graft. The only difference is that the patient's vein is used instead of prosthetic material. The procedure similarly requires the creation of a subcutaneous tunnel to position the vein into its new location. </p><p>The most common veins that are translocated include the great saphenous vein and the femoral vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

In patients with chronic hemodialysis AV fistula, factors that contribute to the development of steal include failure of adequate collateral flow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high fistula blood flow (large fistula). Although the presence of a significant arterial stenosis increases the likelihood, steal can occur in the absence of stenosis.

Thus, among patients presenting with symptoms of extremity ischemia, there should be a low threshold to obtain noninvasive vascular evaluation using duplex ultrasound, which may identify the presence of arterial stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flow reversal, and physiologic tests such as digital waveforms and pressures with and without fistula compression, which are sensitive for a diagnosis of steal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>].

These generally include an increase in size and blood flow with time and lower rates of venous stenosis and infection compared with AV grafts. To be usable, several characteristics must be present for an AV fistula. These include adequate blood flow, reliable repeated cannulation, accessibility in a sitting position, and adequate maturation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adequate evaluation of the predialysis patient with chronic kidney disease enhances the opportunity to provide a functioning AV fistula. This includes a history, physical examination, and arterial and venous evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2392537285\" class=\"local\">'Physical evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and vascular mapping prior to placement of hemodialysis arteriovenous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV fistulas can generally be created quickly with minimal patient morbidity. Based upon how they are created, AV fistulas can be classified into three different categories: simple direct fistulas, vein transposition fistulas, and vein translocation fistulas. AV fistulas should be referred to using anatomical designations that include the donor artery and outflow in their description, such as radial-cephalic, which is the radial artery and the cephalic vein; brachial-cephalic, which is the brachial artery and the cephalic vein; and brachial-basilic, which is the brachial artery and basilic vein. (See <a href=\"#H1761013269\" class=\"local\">'Types by anatomic location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the possible AV fistulas, we agree with guidelines that emphasize starting distally in the extremity, initially creating a radial-cephalic fistula, provided it is anatomically feasible. If a radial-cephalic fistula is not possible, we move more proximally to create a brachial-cephalic fistula. If a radial-cephalic or brachial-cephalic fistula is not possible, we create a brachial-basilic fistula rather than another type of AV fistula. (See <a href=\"#H1761013269\" class=\"local\">'Types by anatomic location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional anesthesia during the creation of hemodialysis AV fistulas causes arterial and venous dilation and may improve early fistula patency. However, potential improvements in fistula patency need to be weighed against the risks associated with brachial plexus block, which may be reduced using ultrasound guidance. (See <a href=\"#H235134130\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques#H320231953\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Upper extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Brachial plexus blocks'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35865243\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Gerald A Beathard, MD, PhD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Feldman HI, Kobrin S, Wasserstein A.
