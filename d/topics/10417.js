Massive hemorrhage refers to acute blood loss of more than 25 percent of a patient's blood volume or bleeding that requires emergency intervention to save the patient's life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Severe postoperative anemia impacts perioperative morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of hospitalized patients who refused blood transfusion for religious reasons: mortality increased as hemoglobin levels fell below 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p>This topic review will discuss management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery. Surgical technique for specific procedures, incisional bleeding, and management of other complications of gynecologic surgery are reviewed separately.

Preoperative assessment for gynecologic surgery is discussed in full elsewhere.

Nongynecologic etiologies of bleeding symptoms may be present. For example, menorrhagia, a common indication for gynecologic surgery, can be a presenting symptom of von Willebrand disease (VWD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Further evaluation by a hematologist is warranted if a bleeding disorder is suspected.

Deciding whether to discontinue a medication perioperatively depends upon the risk of bleeding versus the risk of morbidity from a hiatus of medical treatment. Consultation with a patient's primary care provider and an anesthesiologist is appropriate. Perioperative use of medication is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baseline hematocrit (Hct) is useful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75939 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If a patient has abnormal uterine bleeding or another cause for anemia, testing should be performed early in the surgical planning process to allow time for correction of anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood sample for ABO and Rh typing and antibody screen is typically sent to the blood bank for patients undergoing surgery in which the expected blood loss is greater than minimal; if significant bleeding is anticipated, it is prudent to prepare two to four units of donor blood by crossmatching with the patient's serum with the donor red cells to check for incompatibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Questions have been raised regarding whether routine preoperative type and screen testing is cost effective (versus testing intraoperatively if transfusion is indicated). Observational studies in women undergoing gynecologic surgery have reported that transfusions were infrequent and did not require initiation of transfusion in less than 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Thus, any proposal for intraoperative testing alone would require reliable delivery of blood to the patient within 30 minutes of onset of hemorrhage. Also, provisions would need to be made for patients who require initiation of transfusion in less than 30 minutes (eg, massive hemorrhage or comorbidities) or in whom compatibility testing is time-consuming (eg, antibodies). Further study is required before such a proposal is implemented.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine tests of hemostasis (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], platelet count) are NOT necessary unless the patient has a known bleeding diathesis, an illness associated with bleeding tendency, or takes a medication that may cause anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75939 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A patient's concerns about transmission of blood-borne pathogens should be discussed in the context of current incidence reported by blood banks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661 \">table 2</a>).

However, most women will accept a short course of preoperative therapy with the goal of increasing Hct and, thereby, avoiding the need for blood transfusion. Iron deficiency anemia associated with menorrhagia or dietary deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in the gynecologic population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Strategies to correct anemia preoperatively are used in the order listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron supplementation &ndash; In surgical patients, intravenous iron alone increased hemoglobin levels by 1 to 2 g in as little as one week and a review of 14 studies reported a clinically and statistically significant increase in hemoglobin in patients treated with intravenous iron alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Oral option is a good option in nonurgent cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (recombinant human erythropoietin [rHuEPO] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darbepoetin alfa</a>) &mdash; Data from randomized trials in gynecologic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], orthopedic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>], and cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] suggest preoperative rHuEPO reduces risk of allogeneic transfusion. For women who do not tolerate, or do not wish to take, GnRH-agonists, we have found epoetin particularly useful. However, preoperative use in gynecologic surgery is not well-established and insurance reimbursement is variable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While safety concerns have been raised about the use of rHuEPO, these risks were confined to repetitive use in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning based on reports that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are associated with serious cardio- and thrombovascular events and more rapid tumor progression and increased mortality in cancer patients (including cervical cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, there may be a role for preoperative EPO to correct anemia in patients who would refuse allogeneic transfusion are too anemic to qualify for autologous blood donation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to recombinant hematopoietic growth factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation#H25011251\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;, section on 'Role of erythropoietin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative transfusion may be required for patients who become unstable or who continue to bleed heavily before definitive therapy can be performed. We agree with guidelines which emphasize that the decision to transfuse is based not only on hemoglobin level, but also includes individual patient characteristics and symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H430736130\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Overview of our approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous transfusion methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to correction of anemia, preoperative preparations can be made to use autologous blood in the event a transfusion is necessary. Methods of autologous transfusion are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autologous blood donation &ndash; A patient scheduled for surgery who is not anemic may bank one or more units of her own blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative and postoperative blood salvage &ndash; Blood that is shed during or after surgery is retrieved, processed, and returned to the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute normovolemic (isovolemic) hemodilution &ndash; Blood is removed from a patient, either immediately before or shortly after induction of anesthesia, with isovolemia is maintained using crystalloid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colloid replacement. The blood withdrawn is anticoagulated and is reinfused into the patient as needed during, or after, the surgical procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative hemodilution&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>A systematic review of high and low quality data regarding methods of avoiding allogeneic blood transfusion found that reports are variable and no consensus could be reached regarding which method is more cost effective and acceptable to patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we have used blood salvage (eg, Cell Saver) effectively during myomectomy and hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The device suctions blood from the operative field, mixes it with heparinized saline and stores the blood in a canister. If the patient requires blood re-infusion, the stored blood is washed with saline, filtered, centrifuged to a hematocrit of approximately 50 percent, and transfused into the patient. </p><p>Use of intraoperative cell salvage avoids the need for preoperative autologous blood donation and homologous (non-autologous, allogeneic) blood transfusion can often be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Use of the cell-saver avoids the risks of transmission of infectious disease and eliminates transfusion reactions. In addition, recent evidence shows that storage of blood products leads to a progressive decrease in the quality of stored blood and an increase in inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This would affect patients receiving either autologous or homologous blood.</p><p>The cost of using a blood salvage compared to donation of autologous blood has not been studied for gynecologic procedures. Most hospitals charge a minimal fee for having the blood salvage equipment available &quot;on-call&quot; and charge additionally if it is used. </p><p>There is only one report of normovolemic (isovolemic) hemodilution during myomectomy in gynecologic surgery, during a myomectomy in a patient who was a Jehovah&rsquo;s witness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF INTRAOPERATIVE BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As complications cannot be completely avoided, the gynecologic surgical team should be prepared to handle intraoperative hemorrhage. In the obstetric literature, studies of simulation-based teaching of management of postpartum hemorrhage have demonstrated that this approach identifies important deficiencies in clinician knowledge and performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Similarly, simulation in gynecologic surgery has been shown to reduce time to intervention during a crisis and improve surgical skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. We employ the following techniques in the order of presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Apply pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the onset of intraoperative hemorrhage, apply pressure to the bleeding area. This helps to control acute bleeding and allows a moment to alert the rest of the operating room team that excessive bleeding is occurring. Immediate and ongoing communication with all members of the surgical team (anesthesiologists, nurses, scrub technicians) is essential to an efficient and effective response to intraoperative hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparotomy &ndash; Apply immediate pressure with a finger or sponge stick. If localized pressure does not control bleeding, firmly place damp laparotomy pads at the bleeding site. Apply pressure for 10 to 15 minutes and observe the packs observed to confirm that bleeding has stopped.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopy &ndash; Apply an atraumatic laparoscopic grasper to the site of bleeding. For larger bleeding sites, insert 4x8 gauze sponges through a 10 mm port and hold pressure against the bleeding area. Large vessel lacerations (ie, due to trocar insertion) cannot generally be repaired laparoscopically, and thus, make a vertical midline incision to allow surgical access to the great vessels. Tamponade can then be applied directly as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal surgery &ndash; Apply immediate pressure with a finger or sponge stick. If bleeding continues, place a pack of damp pads or sponges in the vagina. Slowly remove the pack to visualize the bleeding vessels. If a vascular pedicle is lost during vaginal surgery, blind clamping or suturing is ill-advised. Laparoscopy can be used to identify and control the bleeding site, with laparotomy reserved for bleeding inaccessible to laparoscopic techniques.</p><p/><p>While securing hemostasis is critical, techniques must be used carefully in order to avoid tissue necrosis, organ injury, vascular thrombosis, fistula formation, or nerve dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Once the bleeding area is identified and tamponade applied, identify the ureter and major vessels to avoid inadvertent injuries to these structures. Also, it is generally better to avoid leaving packs in place at venous bleeding sites due to risk of venous stasis and thrombosis.</p><p>In some cases, it is best to apply continued pressure while waiting for a vascular or general surgeon or another gynecologist. Applying pressure to a large vessel (ie, aorta or common iliac) should be reserved for situations in which direct pressure to the bleeding site does not stop or significantly slow the bleeding. Attempts at repair of vessels without experience may worsen the injury, particularly in major retroperitoneal veins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify and control localized bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sites of major blood loss in the pelvis (cephalad to caudad) are: inferior vena cava, presacral veins, ovarian vessels, common and external iliac vessels, internal iliac vessels, parametrial and paracervical varicosities, and the bladder pillars, and posterior bladder.</p><p>To locate bleeding sites from one or more vessels, dissect the pelvic fascia surrounding the source of bleeding, identify vital structures (ie, vessels, viscera), and isolate and ligate the bleeding vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vascular structures of the reproductive tract are contained within the tissues that surround the pelvic viscera, ie, the paravesical, pararectal, vesicovaginal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61320 \">figure 1</a>), and rectovaginal spaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60278\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60278 \">figure 2</a>). Development of the appropriate space will often allow control of bleeding sites while avoiding trauma to important pelvic structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Care should be taken during dissection, as the walls of the major veins are delicate and injury can cause brisk bleeding. Also, blunt dissection along the common iliac vein, inferior vena cava, pelvic sidewall or the presacral area can avulse small tributaries from larger veins with resultant high volume bleeding.</p><p>Surgeons who do not perform radical surgery may be less familiar with the paravesical and pararectal spaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56539 \">figure 3</a>). The paravesical space is bounded laterally by the external iliac vessels and medially by the obliterated hypogastric artery &#160; Dissection of this space exposes the lateral portions of the bladder, vagina and rectum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Operative technique'</a>.)</p><p>The pararectal space is bounded laterally by the internal iliac artery and medially by the ureter, and can be entered by incision of the pelvic peritoneum (and preferably the round ligament) lateral to the iliac vessels. Separation of the vessels and the ureter and dissection posteriorly and slightly medially exposes the proximal pelvic ureter, the internal iliac vessels and the rectum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Retroperitoneal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If bleeding occurs, and the retroperitoneum is not open or the bleeding is behind the ovarian pedicle, apply direct pressure to the area of bleeding. If bleeding continues, a fast, bloodless approach to exposing this area is to open the peritoneum over the paracolic gutter and mobilize the colon medially. If the peritoneum is already open, then the bleeding source is identified and managed as outlined above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolate vessels prior to ligation. Placing sutures, clips, or coagulating multiple layer of tissue may injure surrounding structures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small vessels &ndash; Bleeding from small vessels may be controlled with coagulation, suture, or surgical clips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large vessels &ndash; The aorta, vena cava, and common and external iliac vessels perfuse the extremities. Repair of these vessels is best performed by a vascular surgeon. In general, these vessels are repaired by compressing the vessel above and below the injury with vascular clamps and suturing the defect with a running 4-0 to 6-0 monofilament suture on a cardiovascular needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The extensive arterial collateral circulation in the peripheral pelvis allows ligation of most other large vessels in a nonirradiated pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Coagulation is not adequate for larger vessels and clips may either fall off or cut into a vessel larger than the clip, thereby enlarging the defect. Placing multiple clips also makes it difficult to isolate and identify the bleeding site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large veins &ndash; Venous bleeding can be difficult to control due to the relatively high volume of blood flowing through fragile, irregular veins. Gentle pressure with sponge sticks on either side of the venous injury is the most useful method to minimize blood loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, the placement of hemoclips will often control venous bleeding. However, application of hemoclips to a &quot;peg hole defect&quot; (avulsion of the small veins that enter the anterior surface of the common iliac vein and the inferior vena cava) can reduce the caliber of the lumen and lead to coagulation and thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Manage diffuse bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several clinically important causes of diffuse bleeding, each of which must be addressed differently. Assess the volume of bleeding and whether there is flow at all operative surfaces (and intravenous line sites) or it is concentrated in one or more areas.</p><p>Bleeding from all sites indicates a possible bleeding diathesis, and should be treated medically. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Medical stabilization'</a> below.)</p><p>Alternatively, diffuse low volume bleeding which is concentrated in several small areas (eg, sites of prior dissection of adhesions) is likely from small venous sources and may be amenable to the use of topical hemostatic agents. When brisk diffuse bleeding arises suddenly in the presacral area, laceration of the presacral vessels should be suspected and immediately addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical hemostatic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small areas of low volume bleeding can be treated with topical hemostatic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Investigation of these agents has focused on vascular, cardiac, and hepatic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. There are few high quality data regarding treatment efficacy or use in gynecologic surgery. Thus, choices are made based on surgeon preference, availability, and cost-effectiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 3</a>). In our practice, we typically use gelatin soaked with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombin-topical-human-and-bovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical thrombin</a> for localized suture line bleeding.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Topical hemostatic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of high quality data, in general, surgeons should pick the topical agent with which they are most familiar.

In a patient who continues to bleed despite hysterectomy, pelvic packs may be placed and removed in 48 to 72 hours.
