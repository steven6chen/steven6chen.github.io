Later onset, between three months and one year of age, is called infantile nephrotic syndrome. Most of these children have a genetic basis for the renal disease and a poor outcome. The precise diagnosis of the glomerular lesion is based on clinical, laboratory, and histological criteria.</p><p>The causes of congenital and infantile nephrotic syndrome will be discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of four reports indicate that mutations in five different genes are responsible for more than 80 percent of congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80781 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>NPHS1</em>, which encodes nephrin (a key component of the podocyte slit diaphragm) and is responsible for the Finnish-type congenital nephrotic syndrome.

Genetic causes of CNS do not respond to glucocorticoid or immunosuppressive therapy. </p><p>Nongenetic causes are often secondary and possibly curable disorders. These include idiopathic NS, infections, such as CNS induced by syphilis or toxoplasmosis, and toxins such as mercury exposure. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Infectious causes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Other disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL NEPHROTIC SYNDROME OF FINNISH TYPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) of the Finnish type (CNF) is most frequent in Finland, with initial studies suggesting an incidence of 1.2 per 10,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. With prenatal screening, the incidence has fallen to 0.9 per 10,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. CNF has also been described in various ethnic groups throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>CNF is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, with both sexes being involved equally. There are no manifestations of the disease in heterozygous individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Light microscopic studies of renal biopsy specimens obtained early in the course of the disease show mild mesangial hypercellularity and increased mesangial matrix in the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. No immune deposits are detected by immunofluorescence studies. Over time, there is an increase in mesangial matrix accompanied by progressive glomerulosclerosis.</p><p>Tubulointerstitial changes are also prominent in CNF. Irregular microcystic dilatation of proximal tubules is the most striking feature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69624\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69624 \">picture 1</a>); however, this change is not specific and is not seen in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Later in the course, interstitial fibrosis, lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration, tubular atrophy, and periglomerular fibrosis develop in parallel with sclerosis of the glomeruli.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It had been proposed that proteinuria in CNF results from an inherited error in the structure of the glomerular capillary filter. The abnormal gene was subsequently localized to the long arm of chromosome 19 in both Finnish and non-Finnish families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>The defective gene in CNF has been cloned and is named <em>NPHS1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The gene encodes for a transmembrane protein, named <strong>nephrin</strong>, which is a member of the immunoglobulin family of cell adhesion molecules and is phosphorylated by Src family kinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Nephrin is specifically located at the slit diaphragm of the glomerular podocytes; this could explain the absence of slit diaphragms and foot processes in patients with CNF who have a mutant nephrin protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] and in mice with nephrin gene disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In the original report, four different mutations in this gene were found to segregate with the disorder in affected Finnish families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the two most common mutations, Fin-major (nt121delCT) and Fin-minor (R1109X), account for nearly 90 percent of all affected Finnish patients and are associated with severe early onset of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/14,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20,21</a>].</p><p>In another study, 32 novel mutations in the nephrin gene were discovered in patients elsewhere in Europe and North America, but no abnormalities were found in seven affected individuals (including the 5' flanking region) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These patients may have mutations elsewhere in the promoter or in intron areas, or in a gene encoding another protein that interacts with nephrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A case report of two siblings with a milder form of CNF (ie, alternating periods of proteinuria and remission) showed that the two children were compound heterozygotes for two novel, nonconserved missense mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additional studies from renal biopsy samples demonstrated expression of nephrin, but with impaired function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most infants with CNF are born prematurely (35 to 38 weeks), with a low birth weight for gestational age. The placenta is enlarged, being more than 25 percent of the total birth weight. Fetal distress is common and the cranial sutures are widely separated due to delayed ossification. Infants often have a small nose and low ears. Flexion deformities of the hips, knees, and elbows are thought to be secondary to the large placenta.</p><p>Edema is present at birth or appears during the first week of life in one-half of cases. Severe nephrotic syndrome with marked ascites is always present by three months. The proteinuria is highly selective early in the course of the disease and hematuria is uncommon, reflecting the lack of inflammation in the glomeruli. The urinary protein losses are accompanied by profound hypoalbuminemia and severe hypogammaglobulinemia due in part to loss of selectivity as the disease progresses. As a result of these changes, nutritional status and statural growth are poor, and affected infants are highly susceptible to bacterial infections (peritonitis, respiratory infections) and to thromboembolic complications due to the severity of the nephrotic syndrome. Hypothyroidism because of urinary losses of thyroxine-binding proteins is also common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations are initially normal. Renal ultrasonography shows enlarged, hyperechogenic kidneys without normal corticomedullary differentiation.</p><p>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) usually occurs between three and eight years of age. Several studies, however, have reported that some <em>NPHS1</em> mutations are associated with ESRD occurring after the age of 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/20,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,25</a>]. As an example, a case series from New Zealand reported that Maori children with CNS have prolonged renal survival with medical therapy, including with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Genetic evaluation detected a common founder mutation, a missense mutation at codon location 2131, in all of the affected Maori children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nephrotic syndrome in CNF is always resistant to glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs, since this is not an immunologic disease. Furthermore, these drugs may be harmful due to the already high susceptibility to infection. A retrospective study of 21 infants with CNF, for example, found that 63 verified and 62 suspected septic episodes occurred over a mean follow-up period of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Standard conservative treatment includes daily or every other day albumin infusion, gamma globulin replacement, nutrition with a high-protein, low-salt diet, vitamin and thyroxine substitution, and prevention of infections and thrombotic complications. The diet is provided by tube feeding or by parenteral alimentation.</p><p>However, the rate of intercurrent complications remains high, and growth and development are usually retarded. As a result, some patients may require bilateral nephrectomy to prevent continued massive protein losses before the development of renal failure.</p><p>A possible medical alternative to nephrectomy has been described in three children. The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> therapy, both of which should lower intraglomerular pressure, led to a marked fall in protein excretion and striking improvement in nutritional status and growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>If nephrectomy is performed, dialysis is provided until the patient reaches a weight of 8 to 9 kg. At this stage, renal transplantation can be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The European Registry for Children on Renal Replacement Therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESPN/ERA-EDA)</span> reported excellent five-year patient (91 percent) and graft (89 percent) survival for both Finnish and non-Finnish NPHS1 patients that was comparable to patient and graft survival for children with CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Nephrotic syndrome can develop in the transplanted kidney. In one case series of 65 patients who received 77 kidney transplants, 23 episodes of recurrent nephrotic syndrome occurred in 13 patients with 19 grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. All 13 affected patients had the <span class=\"nowrap\">Fin-major/Fin-major</span> genotype, which is associated with the absence of nephrin. Eight (of 11 patients tested) had circulating antinephrin antibodies. Recurrence of disease is associated with graft loss. Plasma exchange combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> and anti-CD20 antibodies has been successful in treating recurrence of nephrosis due to antinephrin antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNF becomes manifest during early fetal life, beginning at the gestational age of 15 to 16 weeks. The initial symptom is fetal proteinuria, which leads to a more than 10-fold increase in the amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration. A parallel, but less important increase in the maternal plasma AFP level is observed. These changes are not specific, but they may permit the antenatal diagnosis of CNF in high-risk families in which termination of the pregnancy might be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>However, false-positive results do occur, often leading to abortion of healthy fetuses. In one study of 21 pregnancies that had been terminated because of increased AFP levels in amniotic fluid, only 12 fetuses were homozygous for nephrin gene mutations as determined by DNA sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The remaining nine were heterozygous carriers and would therefore not have developed CNF. The kidneys of both groups had a similar reduction in podocyte foot processes and slit pores.</p><p>Genetic linkage and haplotype analyses may diminish the risk of false-positive results in informative families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The four major haplotypes, which cover 90 percent of the CNF alleles in Finland, have been identified, resulting in a test with up to 95 percent accuracy. Commercial tests are also available to detect <em>NPHS1</em> mutations. Antenatal diagnosis may be possible for a fetus following trophoblast biopsy if the responsible mutation has been identified in an older sibling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL NEPHROTIC SYNDROME AND NPHS2 MUTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>NPHS2</em> encodes an integral membrane protein, podocin, which is found exclusively in glomerular podocytes and is the causative gene for an autosomal recessive form of familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). A few patients with the typical clinical picture of congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) were found to lack <em>NPHS1</em> mutations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study found homozygous <em>NPHS2</em> mutations in two of five such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These findings were confirmed in a second report that described 11 patients with two recessive <em>NPHS2</em> mutations who presented initially with congenital nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two additional cases with similar findings in terms of mutations in <em>NPHS2</em>, but not <em>NPHS1</em>, were also reported in a study of 13 unrelated patients from Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p>Although affected individuals typically present in early childhood with proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], some have milder disease and present in adolescence or young adulthood. Issues related to treatment of FSGS associated with <em>NPHS2</em> mutations are discussed separately. Children develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at a mean age of 6.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'NPHS2 gene'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=steroid-resistant-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H631397722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'NPHS2 mutations'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients also have both <em>NPHS1</em> and <em>NPHS2</em> mutations, resulting in a triallelic abnormality (homozygous mutations in one gene and a heterozygous mutation in the other) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/24,25,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,40</a>]. These findings demonstrate the genetic heterogeneity of congenital nephrotic syndrome and the absence of clear <span class=\"nowrap\">genotype/phenotype</span> correlations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFUSE MESANGIAL SCLEROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse mesangial sclerosis is a second hereditary cause of infantile nephrotic syndrome associated with glomerular injury and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The same glomerular lesions are observed in the Denys-Drash syndrome, which is characterized by the combination of nephropathy, male pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms' tumor.</p><p>Diffuse mesangial sclerosis is seen exclusively in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/6,41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41-45</a>] and appears to be transmitted in some families as an autosomal recessive trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glomerular lesions are characterized in the early stages by a fibrillar increase in mesangial matrix without mesangial cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. The capillary walls are lined by hypertrophied podocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77219\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77219 \">picture 2</a>). The fully developed lesion consists of the combination of thickening of the glomerular basement membranes and massive enlargement of mesangial areas, leading to reduction of the capillary lumens. The mesangial sclerosis eventually contracts the glomerular tuft into a sclerotic mass within a dilated urinary space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56256\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56256 \">picture 3</a>). There is usually a corticomedullary gradient of involvement, with the deepest glomeruli being less affected. Tubules are severely damaged, especially in the deeper cortex where they are markedly dilated and often contain hyaline casts.</p><p>Electron microscopy reveals hypertrophic mesangial cells surrounded by an abundant mesangial matrix, which often contains collagen fibrils. The podocytes are hypertrophied and contain many vacuoles. There is also irregular effacement of foot processes with focal detachment of the epithelial cell from the glomerular basement membrane.</p><p>Immunofluorescence shows mesangial deposits of immunoglobulin M (IgM), C3, and C1q in the least affected glomeruli, while deposits of IgM and C3 outline the periphery of the sclerosed glomeruli. These immune deposits are probably nonspecific, occurring in areas of previous injury.</p><p>The same glomerular lesion is observed in the Denys-Drash syndrome. As a result, all patients with diffuse mesangial sclerosis should be screened for the Denys-Drash syndrome. This consists of karyotyping in phenotypic females, looking for male pseudohermaphroditism with a 46 XY genotype, and ultrasonography in all patients, looking for Wilms' tumor and abnormal gonadal development. Some investigators also suggest that an assessment for mutations in the Wilms' tumor predisposing gene, <em>WT1</em>, should be performed to help identify individuals at risk for the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. As an example, among 10 patients presenting with isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis, four had mutations in the <em>WT1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In one study of 12 children from six families with the disease, homozygous truncating gene mutations in <em>PLCE1</em> were found in eight children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By comparison, missense mutations found in two siblings were only associated with focal segmental changes. A subsequent report involving a worldwide cohort of children with isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis found truncating <em>PCLE1</em> mutations in 10 of 35 families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. <em>WT1</em> mutations were detected in three families.</p><p>Phospholipase C epsilon is a member of the phospholipase family of enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides resulting in generation of second messengers (eg, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate), which are involved in cell growth and differentiation. A pathogenetic role for <em>PLCE1</em> in glomerular development was supported by findings of disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier and edema in a <em>PLCE1</em> knockout zebrafish model.</p><p>How a <em>PLCE1</em> gene defect results in changes in the glomerular nephrotic syndrome is unknown. One possible explanation is that phospholipase C epsilon interacts with GTPase-activating protein, which is known to interact with the slit diaphragm protein, nephrin. Perturbations of this normal interaction would have a downstream effect including the subsequent interaction of GTPase-activating protein with nephrin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical and laboratory features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As opposed to the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF), children with diffuse mesangial sclerosis appear normal at birth, with a normal birth weight and without placental enlargement. The nephrotic syndrome may be present at birth or even suspected in utero by the finding of an elevated plasma alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in the mother or the discovery of large hyperechogenic kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. More commonly, however, proteinuria with a bland urine sediment develops postnatally, increasing progressively during the first or the second year of life.
