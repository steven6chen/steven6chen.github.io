It is classified based upon whether the etiology is primary or central: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary adrenal insufficiency results from disease intrinsic to the adrenal cortex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81494 \">table 1</a>). These patients have deficiencies of one or more of the hormones produced in the adrenal cortex (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens). The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in infants is classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central adrenal insufficiency is caused by impaired production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). It can be caused by either pituitary disease that impairs production of ACTH (secondary adrenal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56675\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56675 \">table 2</a>)); or by interference with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from the hypothalamus (tertiary adrenal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54164 \">table 3</a>)). These patients typically have only glucocorticoid deficiency and do not have mineralocorticoid deficiency. </p><p/><p>Clinical findings of children with primary adrenal insufficiency include fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints of nausea and vomiting. Additional symptoms can be categorized based upon the specific hormones affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66355 \">table 4</a>). Signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency (hypotension, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities) are often observed. A rapid overview of the evaluation and management of a child presenting in adrenal crisis is shown in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 5</a>). Clinical findings in children with central adrenal insufficiency are similar, except that signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency are not seen. These patients may present with fatigue, headaches, or (especially in infants and young children) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p><p>The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency will be discussed in this topic review. The causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment of adrenal insufficiency are discussed separately.

In addition to glucocorticoid deficiency, these patients are at risk for mineralocorticoid deficiency, which is indicated by low levels of aldosterone, elevated plasma renin activity (PRA), as well as hyponatremia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperkalemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central adrenal insufficiency is indicated by low ACTH levels. These patients have glucocorticoid deficiency but not mineralocorticoid deficiency, so PRA and electrolytes are usually normal. Many of these patients have deficiencies of other pituitary hormones (growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation for the cause</strong> of the underlying disorder (eg, autoimmune disease involving the adrenal glands or a pituitary lesion compromising normal pituitary function). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for cause'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>A proposed diagnostic algorithm to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and determine its etiology is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60520\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60520 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirming adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial step in the laboratory diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is measurement of serum cortisol and plasma ACTH in the morning (8 AM). If the serum cortisol is low, then cortisol insufficiency is diagnosed, subject to confirmation with an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In patients with low cortisol and normal electrolytes, the rapid ACTH stimulation test often is performed at the same time.</p><p>Tests of ACTH secretory ability are performed if plasma ACTH is low, suggesting central adrenal insufficiency. These dynamic tests are also performed if the serum cortisol is indeterminate (or if pituitary disease is suspected because of other medical history) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60520\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60520 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary versus central adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with adrenal insufficiency (low 8 AM cortisol levels), the plasma ACTH concentration determines whether the adrenal insufficiency is more likely to be due to adrenal failure (primary adrenal insufficiency) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (central adrenal insufficiency). Other laboratory tests such as electrolytes and PRA also help to make this distinction. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary adrenal insufficiency</strong> is diagnosed if cortisol levels are low and ACTH concentrations are definitively elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The plasma ACTH concentration is typically more than twice the upper limit of the reference range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There may be a low fasting glucose value. There is often evidence of mineralocorticoid deficiency, including hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Usually, PRA or renin concentration is elevated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the results of static tests are not definitive, a stimulation test can be performed. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency the 8 AM cortisol level is low and fails to rise with ACTH stimulation. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central adrenal insufficiency</strong> (ie, disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus) is suggested by low basal cortisol production and low ACTH concentrations, especially in a patient with known pituitary damage. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with these results, a short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a> should be performed, to confirm that adrenal insufficiency is present. Of note, the short ACTH stimulation test does <strong>not</strong> help to distinguish between primary and central adrenal insufficiency. This is because most patients with central adrenal insufficiency have a subnormal cortisol response to ACTH stimulation, because chronic lack of ACTH stimulation impairs the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol in response to acute ACTH administration (see <a href=\"#H2905090825\" class=\"local\">'Short intravenous ACTH stimulation test'</a> below). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, a test of ACTH secretory ability may be utilized in order to confirm that the patient has adrenal insufficiency. These tests employ insulin-induced hypoglycemia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> stimulation, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metyrapone</a> to stimulate ACTH release. In patients with central adrenal insufficiency, there is a poor cortisol response to any of these stimulation tests (in addition to low 8 AM serum cortisol and low plasma ACTH concentrations). However, in many centers such studies are not routinely utilized and the simpler <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Tests of ACTH secretory ability'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">From a practical standpoint, it is usually unnecessary to determine whether ACTH deficiency is secondary (pituitary defect) versus tertiary (hypothalamic defect). The clinical presentation as well as the treatment would be the same. However, if the clinician wishes to distinguish patients with tertiary adrenal insufficiency (deficient secretion of CRH, eg, due to a CRH gene defect or hypothalamic injury), a CRH stimulation test can be used. In patients with tertiary adrenal insufficiency, plasma ACTH levels will rise in response to CRH. In those with secondary adrenal insufficiency (or in the rare circumstance of a defective CRH receptor), there will be no CRH-stimulated rise in ACTH secretion. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for cause</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If primary adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed (eg, on the basis of low 8 AM cortisol and high ACTH), further testing should be performed to determine the cause. Antiadrenal antibody levels should be measured to evaluate for autoimmune adrenal insufficiency. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the adrenal antibodies are positive, the patient should be screened for autoimmune polyglandular syndromes by measuring antibodies to other endocrine glands, including thyroid, parathyroid, and islet cell antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune disease'</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If adrenal antibodies are negative, the patient should be screened for tuberculosis, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), adrenomyeloneuropathy, or adrenal hypoplasia congenita. Adrenal insufficiency is the only sign in approximately 10 percent of individuals with ALD, and this form of ALD typically presents in boys between 2 and ten years of age. In boys with primary adrenal insufficiency, prompt evaluation for ALD is important because early diagnosis of ALD is likely to improve outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenoleukodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenoleukodystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Central adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with central adrenal insufficiency, ACTH secretion is impaired, by definition. Therefore, secretion of other pituitary hormones should be assessed. Serum thyroxine and TSH levels should be measured. Growth hormone secretion can be assessed by use of the insulin-induced hypoglycemia or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> stimulation tests (often done in tandem), or stimulation by other pharmacologic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">arginine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>, L-DOPA). In the insulin-induced hypoglycemia or glucagon stimulation tests, growth hormone and ACTH secretory reserve can be assessed simultaneously. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Tests of ACTH secretory ability'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of central adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTS OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although laboratory testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, the values and levels must be interpreted with an understanding of the factors that affect the results. Both laboratory and patient errors can cause misleading results. One way to minimize these errors is to make certain that the different tests are internally consistent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-in-the-laboratory-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles in the laboratory evaluation of adrenocortical function&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Static tests of the HPA axis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency, static (unstimulated) tests of adrenocortical function are generally the first step in the diagnosis, and often must be accompanied by dynamic (stimulation) testing in the diagnostic evaluation. Normal values for some adrenal steroid levels are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51607 \">table 6</a>). These reference ranges may vary slightly among laboratories. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Cortisol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for serum or plasma cortisol concentration should be performed in the early morning. If the cortisol level is subnormal at 8 am, the time of a normal peak, hypocortisolism is suspected (unless the patient is receiving glucocorticoid medication, which suppresses endogenous cortisol production). However, this test does not discriminate among primary adrenal failure, ACTH deficiency, or an enzymatic defect in the biosynthesis of cortisol. Cortisol levels drawn in the afternoon have little value in the assessment of adrenal insufficiency, because a low cortisol at this time of day is normal. In individuals with normal adrenal function, serum cortisol levels rise briskly in response to such stresses as hypoglycemia, fever, trauma, surgery, fear, pain, or anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Thus, if the level is high-normal or elevated during one of these stimuli, adrenal insufficiency is unlikely. </p><p>Salivary cortisol measurements have been validated as a screen for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome in children, but the technique has not been well studied for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in this age group. One study reported only a moderate correlation between basal salivary and serum cortisol in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">ACTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determination of the plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level is useful only if accompanied by other tests of adrenal function. The diurnal variation in cortisol levels is preceded by similar fluctuations in ACTH levels. An extremely elevated ACTH level in the setting of a subnormal morning serum cortisol level supports the diagnosis of primary adrenal failure or resistance to ACTH. Conversely, low ACTH levels in the setting of low morning cortisol levels support the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Mineralocorticoid status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mineralocorticoid status can be assessed by measuring serum electrolyte concentrations. If hyponatremia with hyperkalemia is present in a patient with normal renal function, mineralocorticoid activity is deficient. If the mineralocorticoid deficiency or resistance causes renal salt loss, the plasma renin activity (PRA) or direct renin concentration often will be elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. PRA is a measure of the rate of conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and direct renin measures the concentration of renin in the blood. Factors such as blood pressure, posture, sodium intake, and renal function affect PRA and renin, and must be considered in the interpretation of the test results. The PRA or renin assays also may be useful in monitoring the adequacy of mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Plasma levels or urinary excretion of aldosterone and its precursors also are useful for testing for enzymatic defects in mineralocorticoid synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Adrenal androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal androgen levels (eg dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, DHEAS) in blood are affected less by physiologic conditions, such as stress and state of hydration, than are other static tests of adrenocortical function. They are usually low-normal or subnormal in patients with adrenal insufficiency, except in some forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), in which they are high.</p><p>Plasma levels of a number of steroid precursors and adrenal androgens are helpful in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of the inherited steroidogenic enzyme deficiencies (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasias). Normal values for these levels depend on the reference laboratory, and vary by age and gender. Most children with clinically significant adrenal insufficiency due to CAH will be identified at birth or in early infancy (with ambiguous genitalia or salt-losing crisis), so this is an unlikely cause of adrenal insufficiency presenting during later childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-clinical-presentation-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and clinical presentation of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias#H93046139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon congenital adrenal hyperplasias&quot;, section on '11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of urinary steroids and their metabolites may be a helpful adjunct to determination of plasma steroid levels, or may be useful in patients from whom blood samples are difficult to obtain. The 24-hour excretion of urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and free cortisol are measures of daily glucocorticoid production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Dynamic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If static tests suggest adrenal insufficiency, then a dynamic test usually is used to confirm the diagnosis. The short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is the dynamic test of choice in most cases. Of note, the short ACTH stimulation test does <strong>not</strong> help to distinguish between primary and central adrenal insufficiency. This is because patients with chronic central adrenal insufficiency have a subnormal cortisol response to ACTH stimulation, due to adrenal atrophy. (See <a href=\"#H2905090825\" class=\"local\">'Short intravenous ACTH stimulation test'</a> below.) </p><p>Occasionally, a test of ACTH secretory ability is used. The main indication for this type of test is a patient with suspected central adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol and low basal ACTH) that is due to recent pituitary damage (eg, trauma or surgery), but normal results of the short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a>. In this case, a test of ACTH secretory ability would be abnormal, whereas the short ACTH stimulation test might have falsely normal results because the adrenal atrophy and resulting ACTH unresponsiveness seen in chronic ACTH deficiency may not have had time to develop. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Tests of ACTH secretory ability'</a> below.)</p><p>Stimulation testing may not always be needed if static tests and other patient characteristics are sufficient to make the diagnosis. As an example, a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency can be made in a patient with low 8 AM cortisol and high ACTH, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hyperpigmentation, and an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is not needed to confirm the diagnosis. Similarly, a diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency can be made for a patient with known pituitary damage (eg, surgical hypophysectomy), who has low 8 AM cortisol and ACTH levels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2905090825\"><span class=\"h3\">Short intravenous ACTH stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is used to evaluate the response of the adrenal cortex to pharmacologic levels of ACTH. In most cases, the &quot;short&quot; (or rapid) intravenous technique is used. </p><p>In this test, serum cortisol levels are measured before, 60 and 120 minutes after the rapid intravenous infusion of synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin [Cortrosyn]). We recommend the ACTH doses in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53669 \">table 7</a>), which are consistent with a &quot;high dose&quot; test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The response to the high dose test, as opposed to lower dose tests, more closely mimics the cortisol responses seen in the insulin-induced hypoglycemia test, which is generally considered to be the gold standard test for assessing <span class=\"nowrap\">ACTH/cortisol</span> reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that both high and low dose tests had similar diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A subnormal response in a patient who has not received glucocorticoid therapy may indicate primary adrenal insufficiency (adrenal failure). Concurrent measurement of PRA, renin, and electrolytes is helpful to determine the mineralocorticoid status of the patient. If the failed response is accompanied by elevated PRA or renin levels, or by hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, primary adrenal failure is confirmed. If electrolytes are normal, demonstration of elevated PRA or renin levels reveals evidence of failing but compensated mineralocorticoid production.</p><p>The result of the short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is also abnormal in most patients with central adrenal insufficiency, because chronic lack of ACTH impairs the ability of the adrenal cortex to respond to acute ACTH administration, and is thus unable to produce cortisol. Patients with central adrenal insufficiency do not have an elevated basal ACTH level, and have normal mineralocorticoid status because mineralocorticoid secretion is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin system. If needed, ACTH secretory ability can be assessed directly with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> stimulation test or insulin-induced hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Tests of ACTH secretory ability'</a> below.)</p><p>The short intravenous ACTH test also can be used to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery after a prolonged course (longer than one month) of pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoid medication. A subnormal cortisol response indicates there is still adrenal atrophy and loss of ability to respond to ACTH stimulation after prolonged suppression of ACTH secretion. Unlike patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, these patients should have normal mineralocorticoid production, and they should have a normal cortisol response to a prolonged <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a>. Patients with ACTH suppression caused by prolonged glucocorticoid therapy will have responses to ACTH testing similar to those seen in patients with ACTH deficiency caused by partial or panhypopituitarism; however, in the steroid-treated patients this ACTH unresponsiveness is temporary.</p><p>Note that some patients may have partial ACTH deficiency, in which case they may produce enough ACTH for normal daily physiologic needs. These patients will have normal 8 AM cortisol concentrations, but may be unable to respond to stress and will have abnormal results of an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a>. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Tests of ACTH secretory ability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, a test of ACTH secretory ability is useful to confirm central adrenal insufficiency.

The peak cortisol level should be at least double the baseline level or greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If desired, samples for growth hormone can be obtained at the same time. A normal growth hormone response is usually defined as a peak of &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'GH stimulation tests'</a>). Symptomatic hypoglycemia is desirable during the test, but marked changes in levels of consciousness or blood glucose &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> must be treated with prompt administration of intravenous dextrose. The test is not recommended for children younger than three years old because of the risk of damage to the central nervous system resulting from hypoglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Glucagon</a> stimulation test &ndash; This test is more appropriate in children younger than three years. After an intramuscular injection of glucagon, the blood glucose level initially rises then drops rapidly because of the release of endogenous insulin. Serum cortisol and growth hormone levels should increase in response to this fall in blood glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metyrapone</a> test &ndash; This test can be used to assess ACTH secretory ability, but is rarely used clinically. Metyrapone blocks the activity of the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, which is needed to convert 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, causing a decrease in serum cortisol levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 1</a>). In a normal person, the decrease in cortisol levels will stimulate ACTH secretion and increase the production of cortisol precursors. This can be measured by a rise in the levels of plasma ACTH and serum 11-deoxycortisol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and free cortisol. The ACTH-stimulated gland eventually overrides the enzymatic block, allowing cortisol production to occur. However, patients must be observed closely during this test, because acute adrenal insufficiency may be precipitated if the patient has marked ACTH deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-stimulation-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metyrapone stimulation tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3174667724\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolonged ACTH stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On rare occasions, the results of insulin-induced hypoglycemia or glucagon-stimulation tests are equivocal. In these cases, a prolonged ACTH test (three days of prolonged ACTH infusions, or IM ACTH as Acthar gel) may be indicated. If the blood or urinary cortisol levels rise with prolonged ACTH stimulation, then central ACTH deficiency is suspected. Patients with central adrenal insufficiency have a subnormal response to the short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a>, but they should respond to prolonged stimulation because the adrenal gland recovers its responsiveness to ACTH. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1914740931\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Additional symptoms can be categorized based upon the specific hormones affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66355 \">table 4</a>). Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency often have signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency, including hypotension, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities, and may present in adrenal crisis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disease of the adrenal cortex. Central adrenal insufficiency is caused by impaired production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland or of corticotropin releasing factor (CRH) from the hypothalamus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of central adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A provisional diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency can be made if laboratory testing reveals inappropriately low cortisol secretion when tested in the morning (usually about 8 AM). Other static tests (unstimulated levels) help to diagnose the subtype by determining which hormones are affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51607 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Static tests of the HPA axis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary adrenal insufficiency is likely if plasma ACTH levels are high in the setting of low cortisol, with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and an elevated plasma renin activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60520\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60520 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Results of this test are abnormal for either primary adrenal insufficiency, or chronic central adrenal insufficiency (because lack of stimulation leads to adrenal atrophy). (See <a href=\"#H2905090825\" class=\"local\">'Short intravenous ACTH stimulation test'</a> above.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with central adrenal insufficiency of recent onset may have normal results of the short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a>. In this case, one of several tests for ACTH secretory ability may be used to establish whether pituitary insufficiency is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53669 \">table 7</a>). If initial ACTH levels are low, then these tests will determine if the adrenal insufficiency is secondary or tertiary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60520\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60520 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing is performed as needed to establish the underlying cause of the adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the case of primary adrenal insufficiency, adrenal androgens should be measured to evaluate for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency, but usually presents during infancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-clinical-presentation-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and clinical presentation of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency&quot;</a>). Antiadrenal antibodies and tissue-specific autoantibodies to other endocrine glands may establish an autoimmune mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with secondary adrenal insufficiency have deficient ACTH secretion from the pituitary.
