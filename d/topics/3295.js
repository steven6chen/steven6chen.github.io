In the United States, there will be an estimated 165,000 cases and 29,000 deaths in 2018 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the incidence of prostate cancer detection dramatically rose in the early 1990s in conjunction with the increasing utilization of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. After an initial peak, incidence rates fell, but they have persisted at a rate nearly twice that recorded in the pre-PSA era, suggesting that many cases are clinically indolent and would never have become clinically apparent. Despite the increase in diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer, the impact of earlier treatment on survival remains to be proven.</p><p>The implementation of the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF)<strong> </strong>guidelines assigning a recommendation level of D has reduced the number of men seeking early detection, as well as reduced the number of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsies. Some centers have reported an increase in men with more aggressive and advanced disease.</p><p>The high incidence of prostate cancer, its associated morbidity and mortality, the complications associated with its treatment, and a partial understanding of its biologic basis have led to a focus on chemoprevention strategies. The most extensive data come from the use of 5-alpha reductase (5-AR) inhibitors; other classes of agents are also being explored.</p><p>The rationale for chemoprevention, the results with 5-AR inhibitors, and the more limited data with other approaches are presented here. Screening for prostate cancer, an alternative approach that focuses on early detection to decrease morbidity and mortality, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three factors have contributed to the rationale for prostate cancer chemoprevention in men: the long latency period between the initial evidence of prostate cancer and the development of overt or fatal disease, the androgen dependency of these tumors, and the availability of intermediate endpoints for use in clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Long latency period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The marked discrepancy between the autopsy prevalence of occult prostate cancer and the incidence of clinically manifest disease indicates that there is a long latency phase and significant heterogeneity in the rate of progression of early neoplastic lesions. Progression to invasive cancer in men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) may take 10 years or more. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precancerous-lesions-of-the-prostate-pathology-and-clinical-implications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precancerous lesions of the prostate: Pathology and clinical implications&quot;, section on 'Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia'</a>.)</p><p>As a result, chemoprevention strategies that do not reverse the premalignant condition but merely delay its progression to invasive cancer may be sufficient to improve survival or avoid the complications of the disease or its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgen dependency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct or indirect androgenic influences are important in the malignant transformation of prostatic tissue. Men with 5-alpha reductase (5-AR) deficiency (the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone [DHT], the most active androgen in the prostate) do not develop prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The precursor lesion, high-grade PIN, is also hormonally dependent. The atrophy and apoptotic changes that occur with androgen deprivation in normal and hyperplastic prostatic epithelium and in invasive cancers are also observed in PIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>These data suggest that interference with normal androgen balance may affect prostate cancer incidence. Medical therapies directed at hormonal manipulation include estrogens, antiandrogens, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and 5-AR inhibitors. Most of these therapies are not candidates for use as chemopreventive agents because of potential side effects. The use of 5-AR inhibitors or antiandrogens that block the androgen receptor may be associated with fewer side effects because serum testosterone levels remain unaltered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-of-androgen-deprivation-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Side effects of androgen deprivation therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical trials biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of chemopreventive agent(s) may be facilitated by the availability of biomarkers that may predict the subsequent development of prostate cancer or that can be used to define its progression and, thus, serve as intermediate endpoints for clinical trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIN &ndash; PIN represents a spectrum of dysplastic changes that are limited to prostatic acini and do not invade the basement membrane. High-grade PIN is thought to be associated with an increased prostate cancer risk. The pathologic features of PIN and its relationship to cancer are discussed separately.

However, serum PSA is also secreted by normal prostate tissue, and as an androgen-regulated gene, levels are incompletely correlated with tumor burden.

Blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) results in a significant reduction of DHT with normal or increased serum testosterone levels, an effect that may limit side effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Finasteride</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dutasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dutasteride</a> are used primarily for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

At the same time, these agents may decrease urinary tract symptoms due to BPH. Furthermore, they reduce serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels by an average of 50 percent, which can affect the use of serum PSA for prostate cancer detection in men treated with these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

An advisory committee to the FDA concluded that finasteride and dutasteride do not have a favorable risk-benefit profile for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer in healthy men, with an estimation that one additional high-grade cancer would occur for every three to four lower-grade cancers that would be prevented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Guidelines from an expert panel of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Urological Association (AUA) identified key issues that clinicians and men should consider when deciding whether or not to use a 5-AR inhibitor for prostate cancer chemoprevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Further subsequent analyses found that selenium supplementation did not benefit men with low selenium status but increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer among men with high selenium status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitamin D analogs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A link between vitamin D levels and prostate cancer risk has been suggested, mainly based upon the association of vitamin D deficiency with epidemiologic risk factors such as age, African-American race, and geographic area of residence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/34-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-41</a>]. Preclinical studies support an antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and differentiating effect of vitamin D and its analogues in prostate cancer, providing a rationale for the consideration of these compounds as potential chemopreventive agents. No prospective trials have confirmed this effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinoids are metabolites and analogs of vitamin A that are required for the proper differentiation of various epithelial tissues, and they play a regulatory role in the activation of cytokines and the extracellular matrix. Chemoprevention trials are ongoing with retinoids in lung cancer, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemoprevention and screening in oral dysplasia and squamous cell head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid, has been evaluated in men with prostate cancer in preliminary studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. However, these trials have not yielded evidence of activity, and this class of agents is not under active investigation for chemoprevention against prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of dietary factors have been analyzed for their association with the risk of prostate cancer. Although information from these studies may be useful in defining new approaches to chemoprevention, none of these has an established role in prostate cancer chemoprevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Diet'</a>.)</p><p>Phytoestrogens (flavones, isoflavones, lignans) are naturally occurring plant compounds that have estrogen-like activity. Genistein and daidzein, the predominant isoflavones in human nutrition, are derived mainly from soybeans and other legumes.</p><p>Phytoestrogens may reduce prostate cancer risk either via their inherent estrogenic properties (which favorably alter the hormonal milieu) or by inhibition of 5-alpha reductase (5-AR), which decreases concentrations of the more prostate-active androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The higher intake of soy products among Asian men has been hypothesized to be one reason for the lower incidence of prostate cancer among these men.</p><p>The most provocative data linking soy or phytoestrogen exposure to a reduced prostate cancer risk come from animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. In humans, most of the case-control studies have shown a modest protective benefit of soy on prostate cancer risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Soy intake'</a>.)</p><p>In one randomized trial, 310 men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were randomly assigned to a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, soy, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> or to placebo. There was no evidence that the combination prevented progression to prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Several other randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating soy protein in men with treated prostate cancer who are at high risk for recurrence are ongoing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823257973\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFESTYLE FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potentially modifiable lifestyle factors, particularly smoking and obesity, have been shown to increase the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for aggressive or advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Factors such as diet that are associated with good cardiovascular health may also contribute to preventing the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer#H457618736\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Cigarette smoking'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Obesity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The high incidence of prostate cancer, its associated morbidity and mortality, and its hormone dependency all have made prostate cancer an important target for chemopreventive strategies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p>In randomized trials, 5-alpha-reductase (5-AR) inhibitors have been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of prostate cancer. However, no trials have demonstrated an impact on prostate cancer mortality, and the possibility that these agents increase the incidence of high-grade lesions cannot be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'5-Alpha reductase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p>The potential side effects (gynecomastia, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction), benefits (decreased symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia), and areas of uncertainty (increase in high-grade prostate cancer, long-term side effects) should be explained to men considering chemopreventive therapy. For most men, we suggest not using chemopreventive therapy with a 5-AR inhibitor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, chemopreventive therapy with a 5-AR inhibitor in conjunction with monitoring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may be appropriate for those who consider preventing cancer more important than the side effects and uncertainties associated with such therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'5-Alpha reductase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no data that support the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>, or other agents for routine use, and such agents remain experimental.
