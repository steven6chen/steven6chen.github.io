AC is unlikely to be of significant benefit more than <strong>two</strong> hours after ingestion, but may be warranted later in large ingestions where even marginally diminished dose may confer benefit. This recommendation for AC is based upon indirect evidence that AC slows absorption of ingested toxins and that AC binds compounds like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and superwarfarins.

An INR of &lt;4 in a patient with no bleeding warrants only observation and serial monitoring. Based upon experience with this degree of anticoagulation in patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulant therapy, the risk of spontaneous bleeding is low for these patients. However, they should be told to modify activities to avoid the risk of falls or head trauma until they have normal coagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr#H745479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR&quot;, section on 'INR &lt;5 without bleeding'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In otherwise healthy patients with an INR &gt;4 and no bleeding, we suggest treatment with oral vitamin K<sub>1</sub> rather than intravenous vitamin K<sub>1</sub> to avoid the risk of anaphylaxis associated with intravenous administration. There is little agreement as to dosing and duration of therapy. A starting oral dose of 10 mg per day with ongoing monitoring of coagulation status is a reasonable approach. Pediatric dosing should begin at 1 to 2.5 mg orally, however more may be needed depending on the dose of anticoagulant ingested. In case reports, administered doses of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> range from 15 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 30 to 200 days, with widely varied endpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-management/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. We advise consultation with and referral to a hematologist for long-term management. These patients also warrant modification of activities to avoid trauma. In patients who undergo treatment after long-acting anticoagulant poisoning, coagulation parameters must be measured for several weeks afterward to ensure no relapse of coagulopathy or bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Patients with an INR &le;9 are at lower risk of bleeding and in most instances, avoidance of further warfarin exposure is sufficient.
