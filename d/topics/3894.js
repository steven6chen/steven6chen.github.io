It was first discovered in 1975 while screening units of blood for hepatitis B virus in asymptomatic donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sample 19 in panel B (hence the name parvovirus B19) was read as a false positive result on a counterimmunoelectrophoresis assay. B19 is the predominant parvovirus pathogen in humans, first associated with clinical disease in 1981. The other less common and more recently described erythroviruses infecting humans include genotype 2 (prototype strain, LaLi) and genotype 3 (prototype strain, V9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Genotypes 1 and 2 are typically found in western countries (eg, the United States and Europe), while genotype 3 is found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but is spreading.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection will be discussed here. The microbiology, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of this infection, as well as issues of infection during pregnancy, are discussed elsewhere.

Viremia occurs approximately 5 to 10 days after exposure and usually lasts approximately 5 days, with virus titers peaking on the first few days of infection, which can reach or exceed 10<sup>12</sup> viral <span class=\"nowrap\">particles/mL</span> blood. During this phase, patients can be asymptomatic or present with non-specific flu-like illness, and patients with underlying hematologic abnormalities can suffer severe anemia.</p><p>Subsequently, in immunocompetent hosts, parvovirus B19-specific antibodies are produced and antigen-antibody immune complex formation occurs. At this point, immunocompetent patients may present with specific symptoms or signs (eg, arthralgia, arthritis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an exanthem) of parvovirus B19 infection. Individuals are no longer infectious when exhibiting these clinical characteristics. Immunocompromised individuals who lack detectable immune response to parvovirus B19 can suffer from extended bouts of infection with measurable levels of virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If a person has detectable viremia without neutralizing antibody production, it is assumed that they would be infectious. However, no studies to date have addressed this issue.</p><p>Routes of transmission of parvovirus B19 are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;, section on 'Transmission and risk factors for infection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295528473\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection in immunocompetent hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a wide spectrum of clinical findings in immunocompetent patients with parvovirus B19 infection. Most individuals who have serologic evidence of prior infection do not recall ever having any specific symptoms classically associated with parvovirus B19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of infected individuals will be completely asymptomatic during their infection, while 50 percent will have only non-specific flu-like symptoms of malaise, muscle pain, and fever. The remaining 25 percent of infected individuals present with the rash of erythema infectiosum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthralgias, two classic syndromes associated with parvovirus B19 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Children present mainly with erythema infectiosum, whereas joint symptoms are the most common manifestations in adults (particularly women), although either can be seen in both children and adults. (See <a href=\"#H525137743\" class=\"local\">'Erythema infectiosum'</a> below and <a href=\"#H525137996\" class=\"local\">'Arthralgia and/or arthritis'</a> below.)</p><p>Because parvovirus B19 destroys erythrocyte progenitor cells, a dramatic decrease or absence of measurable reticulocytes is a hallmark laboratory finding in persons with B19 infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75004 \">figure 1</a>). Other hematologic abnormalities, including reduced hemoglobin concentration, leukopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia can also be observed.</p><p>In normal individuals, the destruction of reticulocytes has minimal clinical effect, as erythrocytes have long life spans. However, in certain settings, the transient decrease in erythropoiesis can have more serious consequences. In individuals with a history of hematologic abnormalities, including increased RBC destruction (eg, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis) or decreased RBC production (eg, iron deficiency anemia), the decline in RBC production with parvovirus B19 infection can result in a transient aplastic crisis (TAC) with severe anemia. (See <a href=\"#H525138177\" class=\"local\">'Transient aplastic crisis'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, in resource-limited settings where other co-morbidities that cause anemia, such as malaria, iron deficiency, and hookworm infection, are common, acute parvovirus B19 infection has also been associated with the development of severe anemia in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Some studies have suggested that a minority of immunocompetent patients with parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies continue to have detectable parvovirus B19 DNA in the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This likely represents the high sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and is not believed to be clinically significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525137743\"><span class=\"h3\">Erythema infectiosum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parvovirus B19 most classically causes erythema infectiosum (EI), a mild febrile illness with rash. It often occurs in outbreaks among school-aged children, although it can occur in adults as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. EI is also referred to as &quot;fifth disease&quot; since it represents one of six common childhood exanthems, each named in order of the dates they were first described.</p><p>The illness begins with nonspecific prodromal symptoms, such as fever, coryza, headache, nausea, and diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66085\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66085 \">table 1</a>). These constitutional symptoms coincide with onset of viremia. Two to five days later, the classic erythematous malar rash appears with relative circumoral pallor (the so-called slapped cheek rash). This facial rash is often followed several days later by a reticulated or lacelike rash on the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71737%7EID%2F75125\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71737 graphicRef75125 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The estimated incubation period from exposure to the onset of rash is generally one and two weeks but can be as long as three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The rash is thought to be immunologically mediated, and by the time it appears, viremia has resolved and the patient usually feels well. In most patients, symptoms resolve within a few weeks, but symptoms can last for months, or rarely even years, in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A typical feature of EI is recrudescence of the rash after a variety of nonspecific stimuli, such as change in temperature, exposure to sunlight, exercise, or emotional stress. </p><p>These clinical features of parvovirus B19 infection in an otherwise normal, healthy individual were illustrated in a study performed in human volunteers who were inoculated intranasally with parvovirus B19 virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incubation period for this viral infection was 4 to 14 days. The infected volunteers had a typical biphasic illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75004 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first week after inoculation, intense viremia was accompanied by a non-specific flu-like illness, with symptoms of fever, malaise, myalgia, coryza, headache, and pruritus. Hematologic abnormalities, including reticulocytopenia, reduced hemoglobin concentration, leukopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia were observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the following week, the more specific symptoms of rash <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthralgia occurred. </p><p/><p>Skin eruptions other than the classic malar rash have also been described. In adults, the rash is less characteristic than in children and may be confused with rubella. Parvovirus B19 infection has also been associated with other types of rashes including morbilliform, confluent, and vesicular rashes. In association with the Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, a papulovesicular acrodermatitis may be accompanied by severe pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Parvovirus B19 DNA was also identified by polymerase chain reaction in a cutaneous biopsy specimen of patients with papular-purpuric &quot;gloves and socks&quot; syndrome, an illness characterized by pruritic painful acral erythema associated with fever and mucosal lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51856 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Joint manifestations are more common in adults, and particularly in women, than in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>].</p><p>Joint symptoms with parvovirus B19 are usually acute and symmetric, and most frequently involve the small joints of the hands, wrists, knees, and feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Joint stiffness is common. Approximately 75 percent of patients will also develop a rash, although less than 20 percent will have the appearance of the typical malar (&quot;slapped cheeks&quot;) rash seen in EI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] (see <a href=\"#H525137743\" class=\"local\">'Erythema infectiosum'</a> above). Joint symptoms usually resolve in three weeks, although a minority of patients may develop persistent or recurring arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The arthritis associated with acute parvovirus B19 infection does not cause joint destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525138177\"><span class=\"h3\">Transient aplastic crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parvovirus B19 can cause transient aplastic crisis (TAC), in which the temporary suspension of erythropoiesis leads to severe anemia and related complications. This occurs in individuals with hematologic abnormalities, including increased RBC destruction (eg, sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis) or decreased RBC production (eg, iron deficiency anemia). Genotype 3 erythroviruses have also been associated with TAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H621118852\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Aplastic crisis'</a>.)</p><p>TAC from parvovirus B19 is a relatively common event for patients with sickle cell disease. In a study of 308 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease, acute infection with parvovirus B19 was documented in 114 patients, of whom 91 (80 percent) developed TAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The remaining 23 patients with parvovirus B19 infection had slight or no hematologic changes. Parvovirus B19 accounted for all of the cases of aplasia seen in that study. In a similar study, 280 patients with sickle cell disease were followed from birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. By the age of 20 years, 70 percent of patients showed evidence of seroconversion to parvovirus B19, with 67 percent of those individuals experiencing aplastic crisis. </p><p>Patients with TAC usually present with pallor, weakness, and lethargy secondary to severe anemia. Infection in such cases can rarely be fatal due to congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and acute splenic sequestration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Most of these patients will not develop a rash, possibly because patients with TAC are generally older and the rash is less common in adults than in children. TAC is self-limited, as red cell production returns to baseline once viremia declines and the infection is resolved, usually in one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. TAC usually only occurs once in immunocompetent individual&rsquo;s lifetime, presumably because of the development of protective immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Laboratory analysis often demonstrates an undetectable peripheral reticulocyte count and a drop in hemoglobin concentration of &gt;30 percent secondary to complete arrest of erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. The anemia is often sufficiently severe to require transfusion until the patient's immune response eliminates the infection and red cell production returns. Although TAC usually manifests as a pure red cell aplasia, white cell and platelet counts may also decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A bone marrow biopsy is usually remarkable for severe aplasia of the red cell line and often reveals characteristic giant pronormoblasts with viral inclusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83402 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525138967\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetus is especially susceptible to the effects of parvovirus B19-induced anemia due to its shortened RBC half-life and the expanding RBC volume. The relatively immature fetal immune system is also less able to effectively control virus infection. Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can thus result in fetal complications including miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-immune hydrops fetalis. Because of this potential, it is critical to determine the serologic status of the pregnant woman who has a history of significant exposure to the virus or who has any of the classic symptoms of parvovirus B19 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

This can lead to hypoplasia or aplasia of the erythroid cells and precursors and a severe acute or chronic anemia, which can be life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. Chronic infection and anemia have been described in patients with certain leukemias or cancers, recipients of organ transplants, patients with congenital immunodeficiencies, and HIV-infected patients with advanced immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/39-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-44</a>].</p><p>Since the anemia is due to a pure red cell aplasia, peripheral reticulocytes are significantly reduced. Giant pronormoblasts are characteristically observed in the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83402 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These cells contain large eosinophilic nuclear inclusions, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and marginated chromatin. Other clinical findings of pure red cell aplasia in general are discussed elsewhere.

Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 99, 38, and 21 percent of patients, respectively. Hepatitis, myocarditis and pneumonitis were also reported.</p><p>Immunocompromised patients with parvovirus B19 infection generally do not manifest the characteristic immune-mediated symptoms, such as rash or joint symptoms, which may be due to the inadequate immune response in this patient population. </p><p>The frequency of parvovirus B19 viremia among immunocompromised patients may be underestimated; however, persistent viremia in this population is not always clinically significant.

Follow-up analysis of subsequent biopsies documented spontaneous clearance of viral genomes in 36 percent of all patients with single infections, which was associated with improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Similarly, in a separate study that analyzed endomyocardial biopsy samples from 100 adults with heart failure, parvovirus B19 was detected by PCR in 12 percent and was the only one of five viruses detected. However, the causative role of parvovirus B19 in these cases could not be established, as none of the individuals had detectable IgM to parvovirus B19, which would suggest acute infection; they only had IgG, which reflects prior infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>Other studies have suggested that detecting parvovirus B19 DNA in myocardial tissue alone is not sufficient to suggest a cause and effect and that detecting B19 DNA in heart tissue could represent persistent infection with no or limited associated inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].

In immunocompetent children who present with the classic malar rash of erythema infectiosum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71737\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71737 \">picture 1A</a>), the presumptive diagnosis can be made on the clinical features alone (see <a href=\"#H525137743\" class=\"local\">'Erythema infectiosum'</a> above). Confirmation of the viral etiology is generally not essential to clinical care in such cases.</p><p>Diagnostic testing for parvovirus B19 may be warranted when knowledge of a specific etiology would affect management decisions, as in atypical presentations of the infection or in patients with new-onset arthropathy of unclear cause. In these cases, the diagnosis of acute parvovirus B19 can be confirmed by serologic tests demonstrating a positive parvovirus B19-specific IgM antibody. Acute infection can also be diagnosed retrospectively by checking serologies in the acute and convalescent (approximately four to six weeks later) period and demonstrating a fourfold or greater rise in the parvovirus B19-specific IgG titer.</p><p>Because the nonhematologic manifestations of parvovirus B19 infection are thought to be mediated by the immune response, antibodies are typically detectable at the time these symptoms appear. Detectable levels of parvovirus B19-specific IgM can be found within 7 to 10 days of virus exposure and remain measurable for approximately two to three months before diminishing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In some patients, parvovirus B19-specific IgM antibodies can persist for six months or more. Therefore, the presence of these IgM antibodies, especially at low titers, is suggestive, but not conclusive proof, of recent infection. In addition, false positive IgM can occur in the setting of rheumatoid factor and other antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H1295526779\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Serologic testing for parvovirus B19 in most laboratories includes concurrent analyses for both IgM and IgG antibodies from a single blood sample. IgG antibodies usually appear and begin to rise approximately two weeks following infection and then persist for life. The close timing that exists between developing IgM and IgG antibodies means that it is rare to find an IgM-positive serum sample that is not also IgG-positive. </p><p>Detection of parvovirus B19 DNA through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is generally not useful for the diagnosis of acute infection in immunocompetent hosts without aplasia. By the time symptoms arise, viremia has generally resolved, so a negative PCR test does not rule out acute parvovirus B19 infection. Furthermore, low levels of parvovirus B19 DNA may be present in serum and other body fluids or tissues for months to years following infection, even in healthy patients, so detectable DNA by PCR does not necessarily indicate acute infection. Thus, serology remains the diagnostic method of choice in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330790918\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with transient or chronic aplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of parvovirus B19 infection should be suspected in an individual with severe anemia and a paradoxically low reticulocyte count. Clinically significant aplasia occurs predominantly in patients with pre-existing hematologic disorders or immunocompromising conditions (who typically present with transient and chronic aplasia, respectively). In the setting of this aplasia, the diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection can be made by detection of parvovirus DNA through nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT, usually PCR). At the time that anemia develops, parvovirus B19 DNA levels are generally very high.</p><p>In immunocompetent patients with transient aplastic crisis, serology can also be useful to support the diagnosis. IgM antibodies are detectable by the third day of a transient aplastic crisis in the majority of patients. Thus, the presence of IgM antibodies can be diagnostic of acute parvovirus B19 infection in this setting, but the absence of IgM antibodies does not rule out the possibility. </p><p>In contrast, immunocompromised patients with chronic parvovirus infection typically do not generate detectable antibody levels, and so parvovirus B19 serology is not useful in these hosts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433086\"><span class=\"h3\">Documentation of previous infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Documenting previous infection, which infers immunity, is a common practice in obstetrics when the clinician is concerned about the immune status of a pregnant woman who has a history of exposure to an individual infected with parvovirus B19.

The five classic syndromes associated with parvovirus B19 infection are erythema infectiosum, arthropathy, transient aplastic crisis, fetal infection, and pure red blood cell aplasia in immunocompromised individuals. (See <a href=\"#H1295526415\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with parvovirus B19 infection are most contagious during the phase of active viral replication and viral shedding, which occurs approximately 5 to 10 days after exposure and usually lasts approximately 5 days. By the time symptoms of rash <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthropathy emerge, infected individuals are no longer infectious. (See <a href=\"#H848079477\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period and infectivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema infectiosum is a mild febrile illness characterized by an erythematous malar rash with relative circumoral pallor (slapped cheeks rash) followed by a lacy rash over the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71737%7EID%2F75125\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71737 graphicRef75125 \">picture 1A-B</a>). It most commonly occurs in children; when it occurs in adults, the rash is often less characteristic. (See <a href=\"#H525137743\" class=\"local\">'Erythema infectiosum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, particularly women, parvovirus B19 infection can present as an acute arthritis with or without a rash. Joint symptoms are usually symmetric and most frequently involve the small joints of the hands, wrists, knees, and feet. (See <a href=\"#H525137996\" class=\"local\">'Arthralgia and/or arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parvovirus B19 infection can lead to transient aplastic crisis, in which the temporary suspension of erythropoiesis results in severe anemia and related complications. It can occur in patients with increased red blood cell destruction (eg, patients with sickle cell anemia) or decreased red blood cell production (eg, iron deficiency anemia). There is often an undetectable peripheral reticulocyte count and a drop in hemoglobin concentration of &gt;30 percent. Transient aplastic crisis usually occurs only once in a patient&rsquo;s lifetime. (See <a href=\"#H525138177\" class=\"local\">'Transient aplastic crisis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressed patients, such as transplant recipients, can develop chronic or reactivated parvovirus B19 infection with pure red cell aplasia and severe chronic anemia due to lack of neutralizing antibody responses against the virus. The anemia is characterized by a significant reduction in peripheral reticulocytes and giant pronormoblasts in the bone marrow. (See <a href=\"#H1295528480\" class=\"local\">'Chronic infection in immunosuppressed hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B19 infection during pregnancy can result in fetal complications including miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-immune hydrops fetalis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parvovirus-b19-infection-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of parvovirus BV19 infection should be suspected in patients who present with symptoms consistent with the associated clinical syndromes. The diagnostic approach depends on the host and the clinical presentation (see <a href=\"#H1295526574\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In immunocompetent children who present with the classic malar rash of erythema infectiosum, the presumptive diagnosis can be made on the clinical features alone. Confirmation of the viral etiology is generally not essential to clinical care in such cases. (See <a href=\"#H330790773\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent host without aplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When a specific etiologic diagnosis is warranted in immunocompetent patients (ie, when knowledge of a specific etiology would affect management decisions), the diagnosis of acute parvovirus B19 is made with serologic tests that demonstrate a positive parvovirus B19-specific IgM antibody. (See <a href=\"#H330790773\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent host without aplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the setting of transient aplastic crisis or chronic pure red cell aplasia, the diagnosis of parvovirus B19 is made by detection of high levels of parvovirus B19 DNA through nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Immunocompromised patients with chronic parvovirus infection often do not generate detectable antibodies, so negative serology does not rule out infection in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H330790918\" class=\"local\">'Patients with transient or chronic aplasia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Previous infection is best confirmed through serologic testing for B19-specific IgG antibodies, the presence of which reflects immunity. (See <a href=\"#H6433086\" class=\"local\">'Documentation of previous infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending on the presentation, the differential diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection includes other viral exanthems, drug hypersensitivity, and acute rheumatoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H2006851015\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Virus taxonomy update.
