However, compared to other atherosclerotic diseases such as coronary and cerebrovascular disease, little is known concerning the epidemiology of lower extremity PAD in this population and limited information is available to guide treatment and preventive strategies.</p><p>Lower extremity PAD in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis will be reviewed here. PAD in patients with chronic kidney disease and general issues related to PAD in patients in the general population are discussed separately.

As an example, the North Thames Dialysis study of patients over the age of 70 reported PAD prevalences of 28 and 46 percent among chronic dialysis patients and incident patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of PAD in many of the aforementioned studies was made by chart review or patient questionnaire rather than by diagnostic testing. Therefore, these data probably underestimate the true prevalence of PAD in ESRD patients.</p><p>A relatively simple and inexpensive method to confirm the clinical suspicion of arterial occlusive disease is to measure the resting and post-exercise systolic blood pressures in the ankle and arm (ankle-brachial index). A few small studies have measured prevalence of PAD in ESRD patients using the ABI. The prevalence of low ABI measurements ranged from 4 to 38 percent depending upon the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/9,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19-23</a>]. Higher estimates are obtained when measures of toe (rather than lower leg) perfusion are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general population, advanced age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, male gender, and coronary artery disease are known risk factors for PAD. </p><p>Risk factors appear to be similar among dialysis patients. The following are a sample of some of the studies that have examined this issue:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the HEMO study, diabetes and smoking were associated with PAD in chronic hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Age was significantly associated with PAD in nondiabetics but not in diabetics. Hypercholesterolemia, male gender, and hypertension did not correlate with PAD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients enrolled in the USRDS Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS) waves 1, 3 and 4, PAD was associated with increased age, male gender, white race, diabetes, smoking (past or present), ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and longer time on dialysis (vintage) in adjusted analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As with the HEMO study, high serum cholesterol and triglycerides were not significantly associated with the disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In DOPPS, there were a wide variety of correlates of prevalent diagnosed PAD including traditional risk factors such as age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The magnitude of the association with diabetes was substantially greater than for other individual predictors. Hispanic ethnicity and black race were associated with a lower prevalence of PAD. PAD was also associated with hypoalbuminemia, vintage, higher pulse pressure but lower mean arterial pressure, coronary artery disease, heart failure and other cardiovascular disease. A number of other associations not previously reported included psychiatric disease, gastrointestinal bleeding and lung disease, although the magnitude of these associations was quite small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the CHOICE study of incident dialysis patients, patients with a diagnosis of PAD were older and more likely to have diabetes and had a greater burden of co-morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients with PAD were also more likely to have higher levels of Lp(a) and homocysteine. There was no statistically significant association between PAD and C-reactive protein levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis may have a lower risk of developing peripheral artery disease than those receiving hemodialysis, although this observation may reflect selection bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a national sample of Taiwanese patients, the incidence of a first diagnostic code for peripheral artery disease was significantly lower for those receiving peritoneal dialysis compared with a propensity score-matched cohort receiving hemodialysis (12.4 versus 20.7 per 1000 person-years).</p><p/><p>Evidence of a role for nontraditional risk factors in the development of PAD in dialysis patients is less convincing, although some studies have reported associations supportive of this possibility.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few studies concerning the role of hyperphosphatemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperparathyroidism in lower limb atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD. A small nested case-control study found that increased phosphate levels and the <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/phosphate</span> product correlated with PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. By comparison, in a cross-sectional analysis of patients enrolled in DMMS waves 1, 3, and 4, we found that patients carrying the diagnosis of PAD actually had the lowest PTH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In an analysis of DOPPS data, the authors reported that there were no statistically significant associations between prevalent PAD and calcium, phosphate, calcium-phosphate product, or parathyroid hormone levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular calcification, which appears to be common in dialysis patients, is reportedly associated with hyperphosphatemia, use of calcium-containing binders, hypervitaminosis D, dialysis vintage, and patient age. However, the nature of the relationship between PAD and peripheral vascular calcification has not been clearly established. In a case report, there was resolution of claudication and improvement in lower extremity blood flow associated with institution of nocturnal hemodialysis in a patient with PAD and extensive vascular and soft tissue calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In this patient, institution of nocturnal hemodialysis resulted in improved blood pressure control, decreased phosphate levels, and improved uremia control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherosclerotic disease (including lower extremity PAD) may be more prevalent in dialysis patients with the highest homocysteine levels than in those with the lowest levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. However, it is not clear whether hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for PAD in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of PAD are largely similar in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There have been no systematic reports of differences in the clinical presentation of PAD among patients with and without renal failure. However, dialysis patients may present with more diffuse and distal disease compared to those with normal renal function, possibly reflecting the high prevalence of diabetes in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>One clinical presentation of PAD that is unique to dialysis patients is the interaction between PAD and the hemodialysis access. Preexisting lower extremity ischemia may worsen after creation of permanent hemodialysis access in the lower extremity. This manifestation may be common among those undergoing the procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One single center review of 25 patients undergoing superficial femoral artery arteriovenous fistula creation reported the development of symptomatic distal leg ischemia in 8 patients (32 percent) occurring anywhere from 3 days to 13 months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 45 patients undergoing lower extremity arteriovenous graft placement for hemodialysis access, the rate of distal limb ischemia was 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p>Conversely, the presence of PAD is a strong predictor of decreased autogenous arteriovenous fistula blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of noninvasive examinations are available to assess the presence and degree of PAD in patients with and without renal dysfunction. They include the ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, exercise treadmill test, segmental limb pressures, segmental volume plethysmography, and ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis and characterization of PAD in patients with ESRD may pose some unique challenges. As an example, the use of the ABI to identify patients with PAD may be less useful in patients with ESRD due to the high prevalence of medial arterial calcification. This abnormality can result in falsely elevated lower extremity blood pressure readings due to arterial incompressibility. A Finnish study, for example, estimated that the prevalence of medial arterial calcification was 42, 23, and 24 percent among hemodialysis patients, renal transplant recipients, and patients with chronic renal insufficiency, respectively, compared to 3.4 percent in those with normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines in this area, these authors advocate first using the ankle-brachial index and (when the ankle-brachial index is elevated) the toe-brachial index (which is less likely to be affected by medial arterial calcification) for screening for PAD in patients with renal insufficiency.</p><p>For detailed lower extremity vascular mapping, iodinated contrast arteriography remains the gold standard. </p><p>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is also accurate, and due to the lower risk of contrast nephropathy, was previously preferred over conventional contrast angiography in patients with end-stage renal disease with residual renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, among patients with moderate to advanced renal failure (particularly dialysis patients), the administration of gadolinium has been associated with the potentially severe syndrome of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. In such patients, gadolinium-based imaging should be avoided. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF EARLY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early PAD is defined as asymptomatic disease or intermittent claudication, but without severe symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications of ischemia (eg, rest pain, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene). The general medical management of early PAD primarily consists of risk factor reduction and exercise rehabilitation, with a possible role for medical therapy aimed at diminishing claudication. Few studies have assessed the effectiveness of such interventions in ESRD patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factor reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive risk factor reduction is recommended for secondary prevention since PAD and chronic kidney disease are both coronary heart disease risk equivalents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although exercise is a promising avenue for potential intervention in patients with early disease, the impact of exercise on PAD complications in ESRD patients has not been specifically investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of medications have been prescribed in patients with early PAD with the goal of decreasing symptoms, slowing progression, or altering cardiovascular risk factor profile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cilostazol</a>, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, substantially improves physical function in patients with claudication and normal renal function. Preliminary data from a single controlled trial suggest that this agent may improve long-term patency after lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive foot care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been few studies of the efficacy of preventive foot care among ESRD patients. In at least one study, a comprehensive program for diabetes care delivered in the dialysis unit that included preventive foot care and education was effective at lowering the incidence of PAD and amputation-related admissions in the treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Revascularization has rarely been performed for early disease among ESRD patients since there is concern about a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As a result, the benefits of revascularization for non-limb-threatening claudication are unknown in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efforts should be made to improve access to effective preventive foot care for dialysis patients and to identify those at greatest risk for limb-loss who might benefit the most from these preventive efforts. In addition, although there are scant data on the efficacy of exercise and smoking cessation among dialysis patients, these interventions are effective in the general population and should probably be applied to ESRD patients with risk factors for PAD and amputation. The addition of low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> should be considered in these high risk patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF LIMB-THREATENING ISCHEMIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Limb-sparing procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients develop limb-threatening ischemia (as manifested by rest pain, foot ulceration, or gangrene), a limb salvage procedure, such as percutaneous angioplasty or bypass surgery, is generally viewed as the treatment of choice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the existence of comorbid conditions, the management of limb-threatening ischemia in ESRD patients can be difficult. Such patients tend to heal slowly, have a high rate of infection, and are frequently at high operative risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition, a high prevalence of vascular calcification may render lower extremity bypass technically difficult.</p><p>Most prior studies of revascularization in patients with renal failure have been small, retrospective, and conducted at single medical centers. The results of revascularization have been mixed. A systematic review of 16 retrospective surgical case series of infrainguinal bypass in ESRD patients reported pooled estimates of 79, 77, and 42 percent for one-year graft patency, one-year limb salvage, and two-year patient survival, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. There was considerable variability in study outcomes, patient characteristics, and operative procedures performed. High postrevascularization amputation and mortality rates among hemodialysis patients have been affirmed in several large national cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>These results compare poorly to those for non-ESRD patients: weighted mean values for one-year graft patency, one-year limb salvage, and two-year survival for the non-ESRD control groups included in several of these studies were 89, 94, and 76 percent respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, both dialysis-dependent patients and those with milder forms of renal insufficiency are at greatly increased risk for postoperative cardiovascular complications after lower extremity revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In an attempt to address why ESRD patients undergoing revascularization do poorly compared to non-ESRD patients, a case control study evaluated revascularization outcomes among patients with and without ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients with ESRD had markedly lower overall median survival, lower median limb salvage and graft patency compared to non-ESRD patients, despite matching for demographic characteristics, hospital setting, and co-morbid conditions. Patients with ESRD also had less subjective improvement after revascularization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Angioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rates of primary patency, limb salvage, and survival are all lower among dialysis compared with nondialysis patients after lower extremity angioplasty. Among 1244 patients undergoing 1414 peripheral endovascular interventions for critical limb ischemia, those on hemodialysis had a substantially increased risk for amputation within one year of the procedure relative to those not on dialysis (hazard ratio 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the procedure may result in a benefit in individual dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. A retrospective study using the United States Renal Data system database found that the risk of amputation and all-cause mortality was higher among dialysis patients who underwent bypass surgery compared with angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, these findings should be interpreted with some caution due to the possible impact of selection bias and differences in the severity and anatomic distribution of PAD and severity of other underlying co-morbid conditions. Since discrete proximal lesions are most amenable to angioplasty, it is likely that many dialysis patients may be poor candidates for this procedure due to the frequent presence of diffuse disease and distal lesions.</p><p>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cilostazol</a> to standard medical therapy after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty may improve long-term patency. This was shown in a nonrandomized controlled trial conducted with 193 hemodialysis patients undergoing PTA for 372 consecutive lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A total of 71 patients received 100 mg cilostazol twice daily plus standard therapy, and 122 patients did not receive cilostazol. Patency at five years was significantly higher in those who received cilostazol (52 versus 39 percent). Cilostazol appeared to be reasonably well tolerated, as no patient withdrew from treatment with cilostazol. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal cord stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Europe, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been employed in the treatment of persistent severe ischemic pain and ulcers in patients with critical limb ischemia not amenable to medical or surgical therapy. The best results are obtained when ulcers are small and pain control is a priority.</p><p>An Italian study reported the efficacy of SCS among eight ESRD patients with critical lower limb ischemia that was not suitable for surgery or angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Among dialysis patients with intermittent claudication, no symptomatic benefit for prostacyclin was observed in a small prospective double blind crossover placebo controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Increased age, African American and Native American (versus white) race, diabetes as the cause of renal failure (versus glomerulonephritis), male gender and dialysis (versus transplant) status placed patients at increased risk for amputation over a one-year period.

The Veterans Health Care Administration has developed a mandatory Prevention of Amputation Care Team (PACT) in order to minimize amputation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. An observational study reported outcomes of patients assigned to receive conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. All patients had a nonhealing wound (ie, ulcer, gangrene, or a stagnant surgical wound) for at least six weeks, an ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.9 and a transcutaneous oxygen measurement &ge;30 mmHg, and were expected to be compliant with <span class=\"nowrap\">weekly/biweekly</span> follow-up. Of the 49 patients assigned to receive conservative treatment, 13 percent had ESRD and 67 percent of wounds healed with conservative management alone. While this approach has not been tested in patients with ESRD, such an approach may be reasonable in carefully selected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are disparate recommendations in the literature for management of limb ischemia in patients with ESRD. Overall, the management of critical ischemia in ESRD patients remains problematic because these patients do poorly with either revascularization or amputation and because the quality of evidence to support treatment decisions for PAD in this population is quite poor.</p><p>Some authors have advocated primary amputation over revascularization, while others have argued that limb ischemia should be managed no differently in this population than among those with normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In clinical practice, decisions are individualized. Most surgeons offer revascularization to ESRD patients with critical ischemia when a procedure is technically possible, and the patient is a fair operative candidate and sufficiently active to benefit from revascularization versus amputation.</p><p>It would be valuable to be able to identify those patients who are not good candidates for limb salvage therapy and might be better served by early amputation or conservative treatment options for ischemic ulceration. Further study is needed in order to develop effective &quot;risk-stratification&quot; for ESRD patients with advanced disease.</p><p>Given the very limited life-expectancy of many dialysis patients with PAD, particularly those with symptomatic disease and the absence of evidence to support treatment strategies in this area, it is very important that management decisions related to PAD are individualized to reflect patient preferences and expected prognosis. An explicit discussion of goals of care in these patients may be very helpful in shaping management decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of treatment strategy, the prognosis of dialysis patients with PAD is exceedingly poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,56</a>]. In a cohort of 1041 new dialysis patients followed over three years after dialysis initiation, those who underwent a procedure for PAD (including revascularization or amputation) were far more likely to experience a cardiovascular event (68 versus 30 percent), be hospitalized for infection (85 versus 66 percent), or die (81 versus 59 percent). Most deaths were not PVD-related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15078002\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is common among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for PAD include advanced age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, male gender, and coronary artery disease. Increased time on dialysis may also confer increased risk. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the clinical manifestations of PAD are similar in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. One potential concern that is unique to dialysis patients is the exacerbation of preexisting lower extremity ischemia after creation of permanent hemodialysis access in the lower extremity. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of noninvasive examinations are available to assess the presence and degree of PAD in patients with and without renal dysfunction. For detailed lower extremity vascular mapping, iodinated contrast arteriography remains the gold standard. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early PAD is treated with risk factor reduction and exercise rehabilitation, with a possible role for medical therapy aimed at diminishing claudication. Whenever possible, a limb salvage procedure, such as percutaneous angioplasty or bypass surgery is preferred over amputation for the treatment of limb-threatening ischemia, although some patients can be treated with medical management and aggressive wound care rather than revascularization or amputation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of early disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of limb-threatening ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of treatment strategy, the prognosis of dialysis patients with PAD is exceedingly poor. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'General prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management decisions related to peripheral artery disease (PAD) should be individualized to reflect patient preferences and expected prognosis.
