ID (also referred to as cognitive impairment or cognitive adaptive disability) has replaced the older terminology &quot;mental retardation.&quot;</p><p>ID affects 0.6 to 2.5 percent of people in the United Kingdom and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. People with ID are living longer than in the past and most are living in the community rather than in institutional settings. Patients with Down syndrome live, on average, twice as long as they did 25 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the adult primary care clinician will be providing health care for increasing numbers of patients with ID and cognitive impairment.</p><p>Unfortunately, disparity exists in health services provided to those with ID, when compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. Patients with ID are less likely to receive adequate medical care than the general population, despite their increased burden of chronic health problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Patients with ID have shortened life expectancy (ranging from 13 to 20 years shorter), increased numbers of medical problems, and decreased rates of recommended preventive health interventions. These issues can be attributed to multiple factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic factors that result in both ID and a greater burden of somatic health problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication difficulties involving the patient, caregivers, and health providers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiencies in the structure and funding of health services for this population</p><p/><p>This topic will discuss the approach to an adult patient with ID who is being seen for primary care. A discussion of ID in pediatrics is presented separately.

The IQ, a term first coined in the 1900s, is assessed by a variety of standardized tests including the Simon-Binet scale or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The normal range for IQ falls between 90 and 110. An IQ two standard deviations below the mean (ie, IQ &lt;70) is consistent with ID. ID is further classified as mild (IQ 50 to 69); moderate (IQ 35 to 49); severe (IQ 20 to 34); or profound (IQ &lt;20).</p><p>The diagnosis of ID involves an assessment of the individual's cognitive and functional abilities that goes beyond simply determining the IQ. The American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) advocates a three-step evaluation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure the intelligence quotient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess behavior and emotional skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess the impact of the individual's limitations on his or her ability to manage activities of daily living (ADLs)</p><p/><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for ID are consistent with this assessment and require documentation of deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning with onset during the developmental period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many individuals with ID are able to function well in childhood, with limitations not becoming apparent until they are challenged with learning upon entering school.</p><p>Many adults with mild ID are able to live independently in the community. However, those with IQs below 50, accounting for approximately 10 to 12 percent of those with ID, will require significant support to perform ADLs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64507 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 2.5 percent of the US population has an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 70. The degree of disability within this group is considerably variable, as IQ is just one component for determining intellectual disability (ID).</p><p>The US population prevalence of ID is 11.4 per 1000 in children and 6.6 per 1000 in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is up to a ninefold variation from state to state. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that impair intellectual development may be related to a genetic abnormality or to a brain injury occurring prenatally, perinatally, or in early childhood. Injuries resulting in impaired brain development may be related to trauma, metabolic abnormalities (eg, hypothyroidism), toxin exposure (eg, alcohol), or infections (eg, meningitis or encephalitis). Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is an important cause of intellectual disability (ID). In about one-third of cases, no cause can be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rates of brain injury in childhood have declined due to several initiatives: use of car seats and bicycle helmets, prenatal immunization for rubella, childhood HIB immunization to protect against H flu meningitis, and newborn blood screening to detect disorders such as hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria (PKU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 500 different genetic defects have been associated with ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Genetic disorders are responsible for the majority of those with severe ID (intelligence quotient [IQ] &lt;50), while mild ID is more likely to be associated with nongenetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The two most common genetic etiologies of ID are Down syndrome and Fragile X Syndrome.</p><p>Down syndrome, the most common, is caused by a sporadic chromosomal disorder resulting in a third chromosome at the 21<sup>st</sup> position (Trisomy 21). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fragile X syndrome is caused by a single gene defect on the X chromosome. X-linked disorders primarily affect males, with females being carriers, with transmission through the maternal line. Other examples of X-linked inheritance associated with ID include Hunter syndrome, Lesch Nyhan syndrome, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><p>Many genetic defects do not cause mentation difficulties directly but lead to metabolic disorders which then result in developmental impairment. Over 350 inborn errors of metabolism have been identified and affect 1 in 5000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an example of a single gene disorder. The abnormal gene causes production of a defective form of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. The resulting buildup of phenylalanine causes developmental disability. However, if such individuals are placed on a phenylalanine-free diet, they can lead relatively normal lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-phenylketonuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of phenylketonuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early identification of genetic metabolic disorders through state newborn screening programs has led to improved survival and health status of individuals diagnosed with these conditions. Newborn screening programs in the United States vary by state but always include PKU and congenital hypothyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76630 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple challenges to providing primary care for patients with intellectual disability (ID). Patients are often not able to directly communicate their needs or concerns; caregivers who accompany them to an appointment may be unable to provide essential information; frequent relocations between group homes impedes the development of a trusting <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/provider</span> relationship; and patients may be unusually fearful about components of the physical examination or diagnostic testing. Combining these barriers with an increased number of health issues among the intellectually disabled, and the extra clinician time needed to provide even routine care, can further compromise the ability to provide quality care. Nonetheless, the basic premise that must always be in the forefront is that these patients deserve the same intensity of preventive health services and medical intervention as all others.</p><p>Several aspects of providing care, including attention to specific social issues, are especially pertinent for the intellectually disabled population.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to determine the nature of the living situation. Individuals with ID live in a variety of community settings, dependent on their ability to care for themselves. Many live with their parents throughout their life course. Disruptions in care occur as parents age, require care themselves, or die.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonfamily settings range from living independently or in shared-living situations with friends to more structured residences such as supervised group homes to traditional nursing homes, or other intermediate care facilities. Individuals living in nonfamily licensed settings may have facility-related access to health care. Frequent changes in residential settings for insurance, age, or jurisdictional reasons often lead to fragmentation of care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important not to make assumptions about the degree of communication skills that an individual with ID possesses. Even when communication skills are limited, the patient should be addressed directly and treated in a respectful and caring manner. Acknowledge the patient's right to consent to examinations or tests, even if verbal communication is limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who are nonverbal or have limited verbal communication skills are at greater risk for poor nutrition, overmedication, injury, and abuse. Abuse may be either physical or sexual, and may involve other patients or facility staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with limited communication, the medical history will come from the caregiver who is accompanying the patient. Physical complaints may be vague and the history limited. Contacting the caregiver who is closest to the patient is helpful in understanding what prompted the medical office visit. Two-way written communication between health care provider and caregiver is essential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is best to approach frightened individuals slowly and perform a limited exam until they have become comfortable with the provider. For some patients, the white coat is problematic, while others may find it a reassuring sign that it is safe to be touched by this individual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In very difficult situations, presedation with an anxiolytic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) may be required to obtain testing, such as an electrocardiogram, or to perform a pelvic exam. Home visits can provide the opportunity to pursue an exam in a more comfortable and safe environment for the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine health care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General screening and immunization guidelines for routine health maintenance should be followed for individuals with ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Routine preventive services should include periodic dental exam, age-appropriate cancer screening, and immunizations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to care routinely provided to the general population, particular interventions should be considered for patients with ID. The Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services has published guidelines specific to these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Suggestions for routine health care in this population include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate for early stages of mental illness, which is more common in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Early intervention may prevent more serious impairments and secondary disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening laboratory studies (blood chemistries, complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone) should be considered at regular health maintenance visits to supplement the limited available information for patients with impaired communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. Decisions to order laboratory studies should be balanced against the difficulty of obtaining a blood specimen, and the lower predictive value of positive test results in an asymptomatic population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People in institutional care should be periodically evaluated for evidence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis C. Patients who do not have documentation of hepatitis B vaccination should be tested for hepatitis B and vaccinated if negative. Patients should be offered appropriate testing for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV testing; legal guardians may need to be contacted for their decision and consent regarding HIV testing.</p><p/><p>A common sense approach to routine health guidelines should be taken. As an example, a combative individual may need anesthesia to obtain an adequate pap smear. Risks of anesthesia need to be weighed against the risk of cervical cancer in the individual, especially if the patient is unlikely to have had consensual sexual activity and is considered low risk for sexual abuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Scheduling visits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the periodic health examination in the general population may not be the most efficient way to provide primary care, and many advocate providing preventive health services in the context of sick visits, scheduled routine visits may have greater impact and be more important for patients with ID. A system of providing medical visits only on demand is less effective for a population with limited ability to communicate who may not be able to express need. Additionally, these patients often require extra time for a visit because of the complexity of the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/caregiver/clinician</span> interaction and multiple underlying social, behavioral, and emotional difficulties.</p><p>In a study in the United Kingdom, for example, in which structured health checks were provided by 40 general practices for 180 patients with ID, 51 percent had new health problems identified; serious treatable health problems, including breast cancer, dementia, diabetes, and hypothyroidism were identified in 16 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Issues of special concern</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Legal issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues of guardianship should be clarified early on in the medical relationship. While many individuals with ID are their own guardian, often there is a need for a legal or medical guardian to be appointed. This may be a relative, designated representative, or social service agency as a &quot;ward of the court.&quot; A successor guardian for an aging parent should be identified.</p><p>Understanding who has the ability to sign consent for medical interventions is important. Nevertheless, the medical provider can play an important role as a patient advocate when there is controversy over the approach to care.</p><p>End-of-life issues should be discussed prior to the development of a life-threatening event. Family concerns and preferences are important to solicit. ID itself is not a reason for routine do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status; such decisions should include the nature of the individual's terminal illness, likelihood of resuscitation success, and the family's religious and cultural beliefs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexuality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexuality is an area often overlooked, as it is often assumed that individuals with ID are not sexually active. Issues related to birth control and the possibility of sexually transmitted diseases should be considered and addressed with family and caregivers. Additionally, many individuals are living independently in the community and counseling regarding sexual abuse, alcohol, and substance abuse is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9227245\"><span class=\"h3\">Victims of violence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with ID are at increased risk of experiencing interpersonal violence, including physical, sexual, and caregiver violence. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of three studies, there was a 60 percent increased risk for experiencing violence among persons with ID compared with the general population (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% CI 1.05-2.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another two studies cited in the systematic review but not included in the meta-analysis found that individuals with intellectual impairment had the highest rates of violence compared with individuals with other types of disability, including mental illness and physical or sensory impairments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with intellectual disability (ID) are at risk for a variety of social problems, and many also suffer from underlying congenital or metabolic abnormalities which may cause unique medical and physical problems. Common comorbid conditions include seizure disorders, cerebral palsy (CP), gastrointestinal motility problems, thyroid disease, and behavioral disorders. Appropriate screening should be performed for cardiovascular risk. Unfortunately, this population is also participating in the obesity epidemic, with its resulting increase in diabetes. A table highlights conditions that are more common in this population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76615\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76615 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Mental illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses and other serious disorders in this population are often delayed, inadequate, or not provided at all. Additionally, evidence is quite limited regarding the effectiveness of mental health interventions in persons with ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While behavioral issues are often the presenting complaint when patients with ID are brought in for psychologic evaluation, depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders often play a role. Psychiatric comorbidities are common, affecting 31 percent of subjects with ID (mean age 22.6 years) who were followed over a course of 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this Australian cohort, only 10 percent of those with psychopathology had received mental health intervention during the 14-year study period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizure disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizure disorders are more prevalent in patients with ID than the general population. The incidence of seizures is highest in those with the lowest intelligence quotient (IQ) and affect upwards of 50 percent of patients with ID and concurrent CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A comorbid seizure disorder is associated with a death rate three times higher than for those without epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is important to discuss seizure safety with those that care for the patient.</p><p>It is not unusual for more than one anticonvulsive agent to be required in order to control seizures in a patient with severe ID. Periodic measurement of serum levels for anticonvulsants will help maintain therapeutic ranges, avoid breakthrough seizures, and avoid medication toxicity. A trial taper of anticonvulsants if the patient has not had a seizure in over a year has been advocated by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although ID is a risk factor for seizure recurrence off medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to the presence of a nonprogressive motor impairment and, like ID, is a nonspecific term. While not all individuals with CP suffer from ID, up to one-third of all intellectually disabled individuals are affected by CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. CP presents a variety of challenges to the patient and their caregivers, including spasticity and immobility, high rates of strabismus and cerebral visual impairment, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and altered growth and nutrition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and classification of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacologic treatment for spasticity includes the use of benzodiazepines or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>, which is less sedating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Nerve blocks and botulinum toxin injections can be used for those with specific muscle group involvement or if medications have failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Such therapies need to be repeated three to four times a year. Orthopedic surgeries may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Careful skin hygiene is important for patients with CP or other significant movement limitations to prevent problems with pressure ulcers. Bone demineralization with consequent fractures, and decubitus ulcers, may occur secondary to longstanding immobility and nutritional deficiencies. A good relationship with a rehabilitation center can be important for assuring the proper fitting of wheelchairs and other supportive devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysphagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper gastrointestinal dysmotility can cause dysphagia, esophageal reflux, and gastric emptying disorders. This may lead to dental erosion, esophagitis, anemia, feeding problems, aspiration, and pneumonia.</p><p>Dysphagia can be seen in up to 5 percent of patients with ID. The use of a modified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow and a speech and swallowing evaluation can be helpful to determine the degree of swallowing dysfunction and guide the use of specialized diets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consultation with a speech or language pathologist can provide insight into feeding strategies and eating behaviors. Methods to minimize aspiration risk include modifying the consistency of foods to include pureed foods and compounds to thicken liquids to a honey-like consistency. Other important steps include feeding meals in a quiet, non-stressful setting and feeding slowly in an upright position.</p><p>The use of gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) or jejunostomy tubes (J-tubes) to decrease aspiration risk and provide adequate nutrition for those who are incapable of taking in enough calories to maintain weight may be considered. The use of such feeding tubes to prevent aspiration pneumonia is controversial. G-tube feeds can be given slowly while the individual sleeps to avoid the use of this disruptive technology during the day. It is important to instruct caregivers to keep the head of the bed elevated at a 30 degree angle to avoid reflux of stomach contents. J-tubes may be a better choice than G-tubes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-feeding-gastric-versus-post-pyloric\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral feeding: Gastric versus post-pyloric&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constipation has been reported in up to 40 percent of individuals with ID, usually secondary to immobility and lack of exercise. However, specific gastrointestinal dysfunction may play a role and medical conditions such as hypothyroidism should be considered. Psychotropic and other medications with anticholinergic effects may also be contributing factors. Inadequately treated constipation may cause fecal impaction, intestinal obstruction, and even death. Since the history of bowel function may be difficult to obtain, constipation may be missed as a cause of patient distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].&nbsp;Plain films of the abdomen (KUB), with a specific request for the radiologist to assess stool content, may detect significant stool retention in the colon and can be helpful when the history is not reliable.</p><p>Strategies for dealing with this common condition include increasing fluids and stool softeners. Daily laxatives (eg, polyethylene glycol) may be required. Tolerance to stimulant laxatives is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For more significant problems, stimulant suppositories or enemas given every three to four days may be necessary to avoid obstipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral disorders are frequent among people with ID and range from self-injurious actions to other aggressive activities which may be directed at other individuals and caregivers. The most common forms of these behaviors include head-banging, hand-biting, and excessive self-rubbing and scratching. Behavioral disruptions may be a normal reaction to minor changes in the patient's surroundings, appropriate for the developmental age of the patient. Patience and redirecting behavioral treatments should be tried before starting psychotropic medications.</p><p>Communication difficulties can significantly impede the evaluation of behavioral disorders. Any change in baseline behavior should prompt an investigation for an underlying source of pain, or other contributing medical factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In one report of secondary medical causes of behavioral change, constipation was the number one ranked problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Others have noted an association with menstrual discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Potential for unreported traumatic injuries should be considered.</p><p>A careful physical exam should be completed to look for sources of discomfort related to infection (respiratory, skin, urine), pain from minor annoyances such as gingivitis and skin irritation, or more serious conditions such as a fracture or testicular torsion. Potential causes for specific behavioral abnormalities should be evaluated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52451 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach is helpful in treating behavioral disorders. Behavioral modification therapies should be attempted, before medications are initiated. Behavioral techniques include providing alternative options for the individual to choose, and providing follow through with appropriate rewards or consequences.</p><p>Though antipsychotics are commonly used to treat aggressive behavior for nonpsychotic individuals with ID, the use of antipsychotics for behavioral control should be reserved for resistant behaviors that result in significant self-injury or potential harm to others. Medications should be weaned to the lowest effective doses once behaviors are stabilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Newer atypical antipsychotic agents minimize the risk of extrapyramidal side effects but carry an increased risk for inducing the metabolic syndrome, weight gain, and diabetes. Patients who are treated with psychotropic medications need frequent monitoring for potential side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F74435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74435 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rates of antipsychotic use are reported in up to 45 percent of individuals in institutions and 20 percent in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A randomized trial compared treatment with a first-generation antipsychotic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>), an atypical antipsychotic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>), and placebo for 86 nonpsychotic patients with ID and aggressive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. At four weeks, all three groups showed a marked decrease in aggression, determined by a quantitative score, with the greatest decrease in the group receiving placebo; this decline persisted at 12-week follow-up.</p><p>In addition, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is more prevalent in people with ID, compared with the general population. There is no evidence from randomized trials that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> is effective for management of ADHD in patients with ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], although it has been prescribed for this indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022556\"><span class=\"h2\">Dementia and cognitive decline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults with ID are presenting with late-life cognitive decline with increasing frequency; in this population, there are distinct challenges for evaluation, diagnosis, and management. In particular, this is an issue for patients with Down syndrome who have a significantly increased risk for Alzheimer disease. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Down syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1726646571\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Dementia/Alzheimer disease'</a>.)</p><p>There are no generally accepted criteria for memory or cognitive assessment in adults with ID. A diagnosis of dementia requires evidence of a change of function from a previous baseline; a family member or caregiver is an essential provider of this information. Asking specific questions about a change in participation in hobbies or activities, as well as documenting any changes in functional activities of daily living (ADLs), can be useful ways to elicit such information. While cognitive screening tools, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination have not been validated for diagnosing dementia in this population, administering an evaluation instrument, such as the Dementia Questionnaire for Persons with Mental Retardation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the IBR Mental Status Examination, may be helpful in establishing a baseline for follow-up examinations and providing some objective information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. It is also important to exclude possible treatable contributors to cognitive decline including adverse effects of medications, sleep problems, psychosocial and environmental stressors, and metabolic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. These are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety and societal issues related to dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral hygiene is often overlooked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Periodontal disease is common. Mild sedation may be needed for outpatient dental visits; deeper sedation requiring monitoring is occasionally indicated for patients intolerant of outpatient care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNDROME SPECIFIC ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When caring for an individual with an intellectual disability (ID), a search for the underlying cause is helpful; however, in many instances the cause of the individual's disability is not discernible. Genetic testing can be helpful and may be useful for advising families to the possibilities of an inherited disorder.</p><p>Various conditions are associated with specific medical risks that may require special screening. The three major congenital etiologies of ID are Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and fragile X syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Down syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Down syndrome, resulting from an extra chromosome at the 21<sup>st</sup> position, is seen with increasing frequency with advancing maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of children with Down syndrome are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The median age of death for patients with Down syndrome has increased from &lt;10 years to over 50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The primary care of adult patients with Down syndrome is similar to the general adult population with additional screening for conditions specific to these patients.</p><p>Down syndrome is associated with cardiac abnormalities, particularly septal defects such as endocardial cushion defects, and tetralogy of Fallot. Children with Down syndrome are evaluated for the presence of cardiac abnormalities. If adult patients did not have an echocardiogram in childhood or results are not available, echocardiogram should be obtained once to rule out underlying cardiac defects. Patients with a normal echocardiogram do not need a repeat in adulthood unless there is a change in cardiac function or symptoms that suggest cardiac dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The need for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental and other procedures is limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid dysfunction is common in patients with Down syndrome. Individuals with Down syndrome have a 30 percent lifetime risk of developing hypothyroidism and should be screened on an annual basis with a thyroid stimulating hormone.</p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea is also common in these patients and may be diagnosed in childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;, section on 'Sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p>Visual impairments, including amblyopia, refractive errors, cataracts, and glaucoma, are common. Hearing impairments are also common. Annual ophthalmologic and auditory exams are recommended and should be reassessed in the workup of a newly developing behavioral problem.</p><p>Patients with Down syndrome have a decrease in cell-mediated immunity. Reduction in cell-mediated immunity results in a slightly higher rate of leukemia than in the general population, which is typically manifested in childhood. Additionally, these individuals are at increased risk for infection.</p><p>Ligamentous laxity is associated with Down syndrome and may cause problems if there is atlantoaxial instability with increased mobility at C1-2. This is seen in about 7 percent of Down syndrome patients; the majority are asymptomatic. Symptoms are due to cord compression and should be considered if there is torticollis, neck or shoulder pain, a gait change, or new incontinence. Preoperative neck radiographs (lateral cervical spine films: neutral, flexed, and extended views) should be obtained if intubation for general anesthesia is planned or if the individual plans to engage in contact sports or participate in the Special Olympics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;, section on 'Atlantoaxial instability'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with Down syndrome have a significantly increased risk for Alzheimer dementia, which should be considered for the individual whose function begins to deteriorate. The occurrence of Alzheimer dementia occurs at a younger age in people with Down syndrome than the general population; it is not unusual to be seen in the 40s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Almost 20 percent of patients with Down syndrome over age 45 have dementia, which is correlated with increased mortality risk in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Alzheimer dementia is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid plaques. The gene for beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is located on chromosome 21. It is thought that over-expression of this gene, due to the extra chromosome, results in excess APP production. Additionally, chromosome 21 codes for superoxide dismutase (SOD-1); increased activity of this enzyme may enhance the production of hydroxyl radicals and further contribute to neural damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Assessing dementia in the intellectually disabled patient is challenging. (See <a href=\"#H1022556\" class=\"local\">'Dementia and cognitive decline'</a> above.)</p><p>In general, patients with Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease should be managed similarly to other patients with dementia, although treatment trials in this population are limited.

A defect of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene on the X chromosome leads to problems with the production of the FMR protein, assumed to be essential for normal brain functioning. Females, with two X chromosomes, are carriers, though may have some minor symptoms. This syndrome is seen in 1 of every 2000 male births.</p><p>Characteristic features include macrocephaly, large ears, strabismus, high palate, and hyperextensible fingers. Speech delays and behavioral problems, including attention deficit, are common with autistic-type behaviors seen in about a quarter of affected individuals. Physical symptoms, such as large testes, are more apparent after puberty. Hand biting or flapping and speech disturbances are also common. Cardiac valve defects may be present, particularly mitral valve prolapse.</p><p>Diagnosis is established by molecular testing for the FMR1 gene rather than routine chromosome analysis. No specific treatment other than genetic counseling is currently available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal alcohol syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the leading cause of preventable ID. While not a genetic condition, FAS is a common disorder, seen in about 1 to 3 per 1000 births in the United States; incidence is likely higher in countries with higher rates of alcohol abuse. FAS is the extreme expression of prenatal alcohol consumption causing the abnormalities seen in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In the United States, a 2002 survey revealed that approximately 10 percent of pregnant women used alcohol and 2 percent engaged in frequent use or binge drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Ethanol acts as a toxin on newly forming embryonic cells, particularly during the first trimester when a woman may not yet realize she is pregnant. The history of alcoholism may be associated with multiparity, older maternal age at time of pregnancy, or maternal mental illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Characteristic facial features include a long philtrum, a wide and thin upper lip, wide nasal bridge, and a small upturned nose. The &quot;Lip-Philtrum Guide&quot; is a useful tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-adult-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and is available through the <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/&amp;token=zabqurEZHkal7+CWLysn7EzMNCzMvc+apeKEI+sGszR9JcIfST9rXnotsGyPyPIV&amp;TOPIC_ID=2779\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">University of Washington website</a>. Central nervous system damage can include microcephaly, seizures, learning disabilities, and developmental delay. Growth deficiency, visual problems, hearing loss, heart defects, and genital urinary tract abnormalities are also seen.</p><p>Early identification of FAS can lead to intervention programs to prevent secondary complications. These secondary complications include educational difficulties, mental health problems including attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, and trouble with the law. A stable and nurturing home, educational support services, and consistent supportive environment are helpful in preventing these outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Prader-Willi syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This most common form of obesity caused by a genetic disorder results from an abnormality of the long arm of chromosome 15. The Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by infantile hypotonia and failure to thrive. Later in life hypogonadism, mental impairment, and short stature are seen and despite early trouble with maintaining weight, such patients experience hyperphagia, with resulting morbid obesity, which may lead to diabetes mellitus or premature congestive heart failure.</p><p>Strict food supervision, physical activity, and a special education program are the only treatments.
