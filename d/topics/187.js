Care of high-risk patients requires a team approach including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, cardiologist, and obstetrical anesthesiologist.</p><p>In the past, rheumatic heart disease was the most common form of cardiac disease in pregnant women; it still predominates in developing countries and in immigrant populations in the United States. Congenital heart disease is now the most common form of heart disease complicating pregnancy in the United States, in part because advances in the treatment of congenital heart disease have made it possible for more affected children to reach adulthood and attempt pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and Marfan syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, many women are postponing childbearing until the fourth and fifth decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; with advancing maternal age, underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia become more common and increase the incidence of acquired heart disease complicating pregnancy.</p><p>This topic will discuss the risk assessment and management of pregnant women with acquired heart disease. Valvular heart disease and congenital heart disease in pregnant women are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-valve-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and valve disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY OF NORMAL PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is associated with several cardiocirculatory changes that can significantly impact underlying cardiac disease. These changes begin early in pregnancy (within the first five to eight weeks), reach their peak during the late second trimester, and then remain relatively constant until delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Knowledge of these cardiovascular adaptations is required to correctly interpret hemodynamic and cardiovascular tests in the gravida, to predict the effects of pregnancy on the woman with underlying cardiac disease, and to understand how the fetus will be affected by maternal cardiac disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antepartum hemodynamic changes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac output &ndash; The cardiac output rises 30 to 50 percent above baseline during normal pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The degree of change is acutely influenced by posture, as the cardiac output is higher when the pregnant woman is in the left lateral decubitus position, particularly in the latter part of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. By comparison, assumption of the supine position can lower the output by as much as 25 to 30 percent due to compression of the inferior cava by the gravid uterus, leading to a substantial reduction in venous return to the heart.<br/><br/>The increased cardiac output is the result of changes in three important factors that determine cardiac performance: preload is increased due to the associated rise in blood volume; afterload is reduced due to the decline in systemic vascular resistance; and the maternal heart rate rises by 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The direct effect of pregnancy on left ventricular contractility remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].<br/><br/>Regardless of the mechanism, the stress induced by the increase in cardiac output can cause patients with underlying and often asymptomatic heart disease to decompensate during the latter half of pregnancy. This was illustrated in a series of 51 pregnant or postpartum women who developed acute pulmonary edema: 13 (25 percent) had cardiac disease and 6 of the 13 had occult structural lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This response is induced by a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, which appears to parallel changes in afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Both creation of a low-resistance circuit in the uteroplacental circulation and vasodilatation contribute to the decline in vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The factors responsible for the vasodilatation are incompletely understood, but one of the major findings is decreased vascular responsiveness to the pressor effects of angiotensin II and norepinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The possible role of humoral agents, such as vasodilator prostaglandins, estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, in mediating the vasodilation remains to be established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal physical findings may include distended neck veins, basilar rales, a prominent left and right ventricular apical impulse, exaggerated heart sounds, and a &quot;new&quot; systolic ejection murmur best heard over the mid or lower left sternal border. Preexisting murmurs will be louder. A physiologic S3 gallop may be appreciated. Peripheral edema will be present in the last trimester. One of the challenges for the clinician is how to distinguish between these normal symptoms and signs of pregnancy and similar symptoms that may indicate underlying heart disease in the mother. The maternal cardiac evaluation is discussed in detail separately.

These changes predominate in left precordial leads and resolve in the majority of patients after delivery, but may recur during subsequent pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic changes during labor and delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During normal labor and delivery marked fluctuations in cardiac output occur, with increases up to 80 percent above third trimester levels in some cases. These hemodynamic changes are the result of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine contractions are associated with an increase in cardiac output, attributed to an increase in blood volume from &quot;autotransfusion&quot; of intramyometrial blood with each contraction and from an elevation in blood pressure and heart rate because of increased sympathetic tone due to pain and anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of anesthesia used will have an important impact on the hemodynamic changes observed. As an example, epidural anesthesia provides adequate pain relief, but is associated with significant peripheral vasodilatation and a fall in blood pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic management of pain during labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In spite of the obligatory blood loss that occurs with vaginal delivery, cardiac output increases after delivery because of autotransfusion from the uterus and relief of vena caval obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant hemodynamic change can occur with cesarean delivery because of the type of anesthesia required and a greater obligatory blood loss than that which occurs with vaginal delivery. Vaginal delivery is generally preferred, if possible, for cardiac patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management of labor and delivery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimizing hemodynamic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the cardiac reserve of the pregnant woman with heart disease is reduced, factors that encroach on cardiac reserve and aggravate maternal heart disease can be minimized. This involves encouraging the gravida to get adequate rest and avoid undue exertion, avoidance of significant anemia, minimizing anxiety and pain, and treating infection early. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles#H344632151\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease: General principles&quot;, section on 'Prenatal care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING RISK</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92292510\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictors of cardiac events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with acquired heart disease may have cardiac complications during pregnancy. Their risk can be assessed by evaluating the severity of their valve lesions and the degree of ventricular dysfunction. The history, physical examination, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram form the foundation of cardiac evaluation in all patients. To determine the risks and predictors of pregnancy-related cardiac complications in women with heart disease, a retrospective study analyzed outcomes of 221 women with heart disease who underwent 252 pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The findings were then applied in a prospective study of 562 women with congenital or acquired cardiac disease or arrhythmias who had 617 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The four predictors of cardiac events identified were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor functional class (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to IV) or cyanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous cardiac event (eg, heart failure, transient ischemic attack, stroke) or arrhythmia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left heart obstruction (mitral valve area of &lt;2 cm<sup>2</sup>, aortic valve area of &lt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, peak left ventricular outflow gradient &gt;30 mmHg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40 percent)</p><p/><p>One point was assigned for each finding, and the risk was estimated on the basis of the summed score. The actual rate of primary cardiac events (pulmonary edema, arrhythmia requiring treatment, stroke, cardiac arrest, or death) was 13 percent overall, with 55 percent occurring antepartum. There was excellent agreement between the rates that were predicted and observed by risk score: 0 point (5 versus 4 percent), 1 point (27 versus 26 percent), and more than 1 point (75 versus 62 percent). Women with scores of zero and no lesion-specific risk issues are at low cardiac risk and can often deliver safely in a community hospital setting.</p><p>Neonatal outcome also correlates with the maternal risk score. Neonatal complications occurred in one-third of women under age 20 or over age 35 who had obstetric risk factors, smoked, or received anticoagulants and had a risk score of 1 or more; whereas the rate in matched controls without heart disease was 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Women with acquired heart disease who present for prepregnancy or early pregnancy consultation should undergo a complete evaluation that includes an echocardiogram. Those individuals with risk scores of 1 or greater will require more frequent evaluations and close collaboration between the patient's cardiologist and obstetrician. Those individuals at greatest risk should be referred to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist (high-risk obstetrician) for management of their pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92292543\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain natriuretic peptide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in patients at risk for developing heart failure or other cardiovascular complications during pregnancy is being studied. BNP levels in healthy women increase approximately twofold during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] but are lower than the levels observed in patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Normal levels of natriuretic peptides may be useful in excluding cardiac decompensation in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>A prospective study from Toronto evaluated BNP levels during pregnancy in 66 women with heart disease and 12 healthy women; those with heart disease had significantly higher BNP levels than those without heart disease (median 79 versus 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A BNP &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> was measured in all eight women with an adverse maternal cardiac event during pregnancy; in seven of these women, the BNP &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> measurement was obtained prior to or at the time of decompensation. However, a BNP &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> was also observed in 16 of 55 women with heart disease without clinical events.</p><p>The ZAHARA II investigators conducted a national, prospective, multicenter cohort study in pregnant women with congenital heart disease and showed that an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level &gt;128 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> at 20 weeks gestation was an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events, which included heart failure, need for an urgent cardiovascular procedure, significant arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>For those patients who are at potential risk for complications, a baseline BNP level can be obtained. For a change in symptomatic status, a repeat BNP that shows a significant change would suggest decompensation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOMYOPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women in their childbearing years may present with ventricular dysfunction from a number of etiologies: prior viral infection, HIV infection, peripartum cardiomyopathy, or drug-induced cardiomyopathy (eg, cocaine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>). In one study, heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke were more common in women whose left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is insufficient information to determine whether pregnancy might be better tolerated in some groups than in others based upon the etiology of the cardiomyopathy. A study of 26 women from Brazil suggested that cardiac complications were higher in the idiopathic group than in the group with peripartum cardiomyopathy and persistent left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, a study of 31 women from the United States came to the opposite conclusion; maternal outcomes were worse in the peripartum group than in the idiopathic group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A study from Haiti identified 99 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, 15 of whom had subsequent pregnancies. Half of these women experienced worsening heart failure and long-term systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A study from Toronto evaluated rates of maternal cardiac events and adverse fetal and neonatal events in 36 pregnancies in 32 women with dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>14 (39 percent) pregnancies were complicated by at least one maternal cardiac event. All maternal cardiac events occurred in women with moderate or severe LV systolic dysfunction (defined as left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt;45 percent) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a prior cardiac event. The presence of any one of these three risk factors was associated with a 64 percent risk of an adverse cardiac event. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 16 month event-free survival for a subset of 18 pregnant women with LVEF &lt;45 percent was significantly worse compared with 18 age and LVEF-matched nonpregnant women with dilated cardiomyopathy (28 versus 83 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven of 35 (20 percent) pregnancies (excluding one pregnancy ending in induced abortion) were complicated by an adverse fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal event. The adverse neonatal event rate was highest among women with both obstetric and cardiac risk factors.</p><p/><p>Patients with known or suspected left ventricular dysfunction should have an echocardiogram before conception, or as soon as possible after pregnancy is confirmed, to determine baseline ventricular function. Pregnancy should be discouraged if there is a significant reduction in ventricular function (ejection fraction &lt;45 percent). Of concern, women with prior peripartum cardiomyopathy in whom left ventricular function has returned to normal (&ge;50 percent) still remain at significant risk for morbidity during subsequent pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Patients with reduced ventricular function may require restriction of activity, medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, diuretics, vasodilators), and close monitoring during labor and delivery to avoid significant volume shifts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of heart failure during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnancy is generally well tolerated in women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. A study from Italy showed that the risk of death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is increased over that of the general population, although the absolute mortality is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Clinical deterioration with development of congestive heart failure occurred in 15 percent of the cohort and was related to their functional status prior to pregnancy.

This would include women with a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery dissection, coronary artery bypass surgery, and CAD from a systemic process such as vasculitis. This population is likely to increase, given that the only increase in birth rate in 2009 occurred in women aged 40 to 44 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>A retrospective study from Canada and several European countries looked at adverse maternal cardiac, obstetric, and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> events in women with a pre-existing history of CAD or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including MI; patients with Kawasaki disease and anomalous coronary arteries without ischemic events were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Ten percent of the patients had a primary cardiac event (cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">arrest/ventricular</span> arrhythmia, <span class=\"nowrap\">ACS/MI,</span> or heart failure). Twenty-six percent had ischemic cardiac events (new or progressive angina, <span class=\"nowrap\">ACS/MI,</span> ventricular arrhythmia, or cardiac arrest). Adverse obstetric outcomes occurred in 16 percent, and 30 percent were complicated by an adverse <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> event.</p><p>For women with a history of CAD, it is recommended that prior to pregnancy, baseline left ventricular function should be determined, and stress testing may be beneficial to rule out active ischemia. It is currently recommended that medications, including lipid-lowering therapy (category X), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (category X), and antiplatelet agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> (category B), be discontinued. However, cessation of lipid lowering therapy might impact unfavorably on prior coronary interventions and on lipid profiles during pregnancy, especially in young women with familial lipid problems. There are some data to suggest that lipid lowering therapy may not be as teratogenic as originally thought. One observational cohort study looking at the risk of malformations in a group of women exposed to lipid lowering drugs in the first trimester compared with a group without exposure showed no difference in the rate of malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pravastatin</a> is being considered as a potential therapy for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in high-risk pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. For high risk CAD patients taking clopidogrel, the drug could be used during pregnancy if needed, although the drug should be stopped prior to delivery to minimize bleeding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4171842\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute myocardial infarction is a rare event in pregnancy and some women with a prior infarction become pregnant.

Potential factors in pregnancy that can promote arrhythmogenesis include the hyperdynamic state (high cardiac output, increased contractility), the altered hormonal milieu, and underlying heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>A study showed that recurrence of arrhythmias in women with preexisting rhythm disorders is common and that recurrence of arrhythmias increases the risk of adverse fetal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Lumbar epidural anesthesia is highly effective for controlling labor pain and is recommended because it lowers pain-induced elevations of sympathetic activity, reduces the urge to push, and provides excellent anesthesia for operative procedures. The epidural should be dosed slowly with local anesthetics to maintain stable hemodynamics and adequate uteroplacental blood flow since venous return can be reduced by the anesthetic. Intravenous fluid administration must be monitored carefully to avoid over or under hydration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for labor and delivery in high-risk heart disease: General considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic arterial pressure and heart rate are routinely monitored during labor; pulse oximetry and continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring are utilized as required by the patient's condition. A Swan-Ganz catheter for hemodynamic monitoring should not be routinely employed.

Cesarean delivery is generally reserved for obstetric indications. However, urgent cesarean delivery is suggested for gravidas with advanced heart failure and hemodynamic instability despite treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].<br/></p><p>Cesarean delivery should generally be reserved for obstetric indications such as failure to progress in labor, placenta previa, or fetal intolerance to labor. The concerns about cesarean delivery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General anesthesia, if required, incurs the risk of hemodynamic instability associated with intubation and the anesthetic agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cesarean delivery is accompanied by blood loss that is approximately twice as great as with vaginal delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are increased risks of wound and uterine infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative thrombophlebitis is more common after cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of postoperative incisional bleeding is high in patients requiring anticoagulants.</p><p/><p>Spontaneous onset of labor is preferred to induced labor for most women with heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Pregnant women with cardiac disease who are considered functionally normal or well-controlled should be allowed to go into labor spontaneously. If there are any concerns about the functional adequacy of the heart and circulation, induction of labor under controlled conditions is suggested. The timing of induction is individualized, taking into account the gravida's cardiac status, inducibility of the cervix, and fetal lung maturity. A long induction in a woman with an unfavorable cervix should be avoided. From a practical point of view, it may be useful to plan the induction so that delivery occurs during the working day when all hospital services are readily available.</p><p>Induction of labor in a gravida with a favorable cervix usually requires only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> administration and artificial rupture of the membranes. An unfavorable cervix should be ripened with a prostaglandin E analogue. The softened, dilated cervix is more responsive to subsequent induction of labor and permits the normal physiologic sequence of softening and dilatation before the onset of uterine contractions. Prostaglandin analogues are absorbed into the systemic circulation and can lower systemic vascular resistance, lower systemic pressure, and increase heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These effects are more frequent with E2 than E1 and when the drugs are used in the higher doses required for termination of pregnancy. Laminaria or a Foley catheter balloon can also be used for cervical ripening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once in labor, the woman should be placed in a lateral decubitus position to attenuate the hemodynamic fluctuations associated with major uterine contractions and the supine position. The obstetrician should allow uterine contraction to descend the fetal head to the perineum, unassisted by maternal pushing, to avoid the undesirable circulatory effects of the Valsalva maneuver. Delivery may then be assisted by low forceps or vacuum extraction, as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A reduction in uterine blood flow and placental oxygen delivery typically occurs during uterine contractions; however, the fetus is adapted to extract enough oxygen to maintain fetal health. Complications of labor (eg, abruption, cord compression) or maternal hemodynamic instability may subject the fetus to decreased oxygenation and lead to fetal acidosis or death. The growth restricted fetus is especially vulnerable to hypoxia during labor. For this reason, continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring is recommended to assess fetal well-being during labor and allow timely intervention if nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Care of the high-risk patients requires a team approach including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, cardiologist, and obstetrical anesthesiologist. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is associated with several cardiocirculatory changes that can significantly impact underlying cardiac disease. Knowledge of these cardiovascular adaptations is required to correctly interpret hemodynamic and cardiovascular tests in the gravida, to predict the effects of pregnancy on the woman with underlying cardiac disease, and to understand how the fetus will be affected by maternal cardiac disorders. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of normal pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) during pregnancy has been shown to be a predictor of cardiovascular events. BNP levels should be interpreted in the clinical context during pregnancy, as levels generally increase approximately twofold during uncomplicated pregnancy. A negative BNP is helpful to exclude heart failure.
