The lifetime risk of a foot ulcer for diabetic patients (type 1 or 2) may be as high as 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A potentially preventable initiating event, most often minor trauma that causes cutaneous injury, can often be identified. Foot amputations, many of which are preventable with early recognition and therapy, may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These observations illustrate the importance of frequent evaluation of the feet in patients with diabetes to identify those at risk for foot ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Systematic screening examinations for neuropathic and vascular involvement of the lower extremities and careful inspection of feet may substantially reduce morbidity from foot problems.</p><p>Evaluation of the diabetic foot is provided here. A discussion of diabetes-related foot infections (cellulitis and osteomyelitis) and the management of diabetic foot ulcers are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of diabetic infections of the lower extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of diabetic foot ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several risk factors are predictive of ulcers and amputation. Early recognition and management of risk factors is important for reducing morbidity of foot ulceration. Most risk factors are readily identifiable from the history or physical examination. The most important are previous foot ulceration, neuropathy (loss of protective sensation), foot deformity, and vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The significance of these risk factors was confirmed by the results of a community-based study of 1300 type 2 diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The incidence of lower extremity amputation was 3.8 per 1000 patient-years. Predictors of amputation were foot ulceration (hazard ratio [HR] 5.6, 95% CI 1.2-25), ankle brachial index &lt;0.9, elevated glycated hemoglobin (A1C), and neuropathy.</p><p>Neuropathy is present in over 80 percent of patients with foot ulcers; it promotes ulcer formation by decreasing pain sensation and perception of pressure, by causing muscle imbalance that can lead to anatomic deformities, and by impairing the microcirculation and the integrity of the skin. Once ulcers form, healing may be delayed or difficult to achieve, particularly if infection penetrates to deep tissues and bone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is diminished local blood flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several risk classification systems designed to predict foot ulcer in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Risk categorization can be used to design preventive and monitoring strategies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70817 \">table 1</a>). One system, developed by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, stratifies patients as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 0 &ndash; No evidence of neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 1 &ndash; Neuropathy present but no evidence of foot deformity or peripheral vascular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 2 &ndash; Neuropathy with evidence of deformity or peripheral vascular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 3 &ndash; History of foot ulceration or lower extremity amputation</p><p/><p>In a prospective, case-control study of 225 patients with diabetes, stratification using this classification system was predictive of incident ulceration and amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. During 30 months (mean) of follow-up, ulcers occurred in 5, 14, 13, and 65 percent of patients in groups 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Only patients in groups 2 and 3 had amputations (2 and 26 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An abbreviated history combined with physical examination can usually establish the presence and severity of diabetic neuropathy and peripheral artery disease, two of the most important risk factors for developing foot ulcers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Historical facts to ascertain include duration of diabetes, glycemic control, presence of micro- or macrovascular disease, history of prior foot ulcers, lower limb bypasses or amputation, presence of claudication, and history of cigarette smoking. Two cohort studies have demonstrated an increased risk of foot ulcers in those with a longer history of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This may be related to the finding that the risk of peripheral artery disease appears to increase with the duration of type 2 diabetes. As an example, in an observational study of 48,607 men, the relative risk of peripheral artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with nondiabetics was 1.4 and 4.5 for one to five years and &gt;25 years of diabetes, respectively, even after controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Peripheral neuropathy also increases with longer diabetes duration.</p><p>The patient should be questioned about leg discomfort. If present, further questions should be asked that allow a quantitative assessment of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the sensation felt? &ndash; Burning, numbness, or tingling (2 points); fatigue, cramping, or aching (1 point). Maximum is 2 points.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the location of symptoms? &ndash; Feet (2 points); calves (1 point); elsewhere (no points). Maximum is 2 points.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have the symptoms ever awoken you at night? &ndash; Yes (1 point).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the timing of symptoms? &ndash; Worse at night (2 points); present day and night (1 point); present only during the day (no points). Maximum is 2 points.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How are symptoms relieved? &ndash; Walking around (2 points); standing (1 point); sitting or lying or no relief (no points). Maximum is 2 points.</p><p/><p>The total symptom score can then be determined:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 to 2 &ndash; Normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 to 4 &ndash; Mild</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 to 6 &ndash; Moderate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>7 to 9 &ndash; Severe</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include an assessment for the presence of existing ulcers; peripheral neuropathy and, in particular, the loss of protective sensation; peripheral artery disease; and foot deformities that may predispose the patient to the development of foot ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59069 \">table 2</a>). Several reports indicate that adequate examinations relevant to foot ulceration are often not performed in diabetic patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When 1434 clinicians in the United States were surveyed about how closely they were adhering to the nationally promoted and American Diabetes Association (ADA)-endorsed recommendations for routine care, only 50 percent did semiannual neurologic and foot examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a major California health maintenance organization (HMO) that provides care for 14,539 diabetic patients, only 6 percent had a documented foot examination within the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical signs of neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropathy is present in over 80 percent of patients with foot ulcers; it promotes ulcer formation by decreasing pain sensation and perception of pressure, by causing muscle imbalance that can lead to anatomic deformities, and by impairing the microcirculation and the integrity of the skin.</p><p>The physical examination may reveal several abnormalities that result from diabetic neuropathy, such as claw toes and Charcot arthropathy (also called diabetic neuropathic arthropathy). Chronic motor neuropathy often affects the small intrinsic muscles of the feet so that the action of the larger muscles in the anterior tibial compartment is unopposed. This leads to subluxation of the proximal interphalangeal-metatarsal joints, resulting in a claw toe appearance. One consequence of this abnormality is increased pressure on the metatarsal heads, which are a common site of ulcer development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51991\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51991 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>A later complication is Charcot arthropathy, which is characterized by collapse of the arch of the midfoot and abnormal bony prominences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67753\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67753 \">picture 2</a>). These changes are induced by the triad of small muscle wasting, decreased sensation, and abnormal distribution of weight when standing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathic-arthropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic neuropathic arthropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The associated autonomic neuropathy can lead to several additional problems. Sweating is diminished or absent; as a result, the skin of the feet remains dry and has a tendency to become scaly and cracked, thereby allowing infection to penetrate below the skin. Lack of autonomic tone in the capillary circulation causes shunting of blood from arteries directly into veins, bypassing the tissues that need nutrition. This results in a foot that feels warm and has distended veins and bounding pulses. Despite these apparent signs of adequate perfusion, the foot is vulnerable to local &quot;microvascular&quot; gangrene, will heal very poorly and slowly, and will be less able to resist infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening tests for peripheral neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical practice, peripheral neuropathy is most frequently assessed by determination of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vibration sensation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure sensation (monofilament)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial pain (pinprick) or temperature sensation</p><p/><p>The tests are designed to identify loss of protective sensation, an important risk factor for ulcer formation. Screening with simple vibration testing, a monofilament examination, or superficial pain sensation appear to have a similar sensitivity and specificity for predicting diabetic neuropathy and therefore risk of foot ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One study found that failure to detect pressure from monofilament at any of 12 places on the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52481\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52481 \">figure 1</a>) was the single most practical measurement of risk assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Vibration sensation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vibration testing is typically conducted with a 128 Hz tuning fork applied to the bony prominence at the dorsum of the first toe, just proximal to the nail bed. The quickest method of testing is to ask the patient to report the perception of both the start of vibration sensation and the cessation of vibration on dampening. The test should be conducted twice on each great toe. The sensitivity and specificity of vibration testing for peripheral neuropathy have been estimated to be 53 and 99 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Vibration sense can also be estimated quantitatively with a biothesiometer. This device is essentially an electronic tuning fork that allows the vibration to be adjusted up or down depending upon the voltage applied. The vibration-perception threshold (VPT) is defined as the lowest voltage at which vibration can be sensed on the pulp of the big toe. The value in normal subjects increases with age from approximately 6 volts at age 30 years to 20 volts at age 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In a prospective trial of 469 diabetic patients with no history of foot ulceration, the VPT was found to be an excellent predictor of future foot ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Less than 4 percent of patients with a VPT below 25 volts developed new ulcers versus almost 20 percent of those with a VPT above 25 volts. Furthermore, there was an excellent correlation between the VPT and the severity of findings on physical examination. A simpler alternative to the Biothesiometer is the graduated tuning fork, which can also provide a quantitative estimate of vibration sense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Pressure sensation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another simple device, the monofilament pressure esthesiometer, permits quantitative assessment of the cutaneous pressure perception threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 5.07 (10 g) monofilament is placed at a right angle to the skin on the plantar surface of the foot; pressure is then increased until the filament buckles, indicating that a known amount of pressure has been applied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68612\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68612 \">picture 3</a>). The patient is asked if he or she felt the pressure induced by the monofilament.</p><p>In a cross-sectional study of 314 diabetic patients, those with foot ulcers had a higher pressure threshold than those without ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A cutaneous pressure threshold of 4.21 U or above had a sensitivity of 84 percent, a specificity of 96 percent, and a positive predictive value of 76 percent for foot ulceration. Prospective studies have shown that insensitivity to this monofilament correlates with an increased likelihood for developing plantar ulceration or lower extremity amputation in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/9,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain and temperature sense</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either pain or temperature sense can be tested; it is not necessary to evaluate both. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical signs of peripheral artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The feet should be examined for signs of peripheral artery disease such as diminished foot pulses, decrease in skin temperature, thin skin, lack of skin hair, and bluish skin color. However, qualitative signs are less sensitive and not specific enough to guide further management to be helpful in an individual patient. More useful quantitative clinical tests include measurement of venous filling time, Doppler examination of lower limb pulses, and leg blood pressure measurements (eg, ankle-brachial pressure index [ABI]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The absence of foot pulses, presence of femoral bruits, prolongation of venous filling, and reduction in ABI should prompt referral for more detailed evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H380413346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The venous filling time can be determined by identifying a prominent pedal vein with the patient in a supine position. The leg is then elevated to 45&deg; for one minute, leading to collapse of the vein. The patient then sits up and hangs the leg over the examination table; important arterial disease is probably present if more than 20 seconds elapse before the vein bulges above the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H380413346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with clinical evidence of peripheral artery disease should have ABI testing. This index is calculated by measuring the systolic blood pressure (by Doppler probe) in the brachial, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For each leg, the higher of the two measurements at the ankles and feet is divided by the higher of the two brachial measurements. The normal index is 0.9 to 1.3 and is generally &gt;1.0 because the pressure is higher in the ankle than in the arm. An index &lt;0.9 has 95 percent sensitivity for detecting angiogram-positive peripheral artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. We typically refer patients with an abnormal ABI to a vascular specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Ankle-brachial index'</a>.)</p><p>A low ABI in the absence of a foot ulcer does not correlate with the risk of future foot ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; however, a low index in the presence of a foot ulcer suggests that the prognosis will be improved with reconstructive vascular surgery. In one series of patients with neuropathic foot ulcers and severe arterial insufficiency, for example, 35 of 42 extremities (83 percent) with patent bypass grafts achieved and maintained primary healing of their ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A low ankle-to-brachial index also indicates more generalized arteriosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Foot ulceration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foot ulcers are usually classified into two groups: acute ulcers secondary to dermal abrasion from poorly fitting shoes, and chronic ulcers occurring over areas prone to pressure. Chronic ulceration is probably multifactorial, due to a combination of diabetic neuropathy (with decreased pain sensation), autonomic dysfunction, and vascular insufficiency.</p><p>Findings that may herald a developing foot ulcer include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions between adjacent toes due to pressure from tight shoes cramming them together</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macerated areas between the toes (&quot;athlete's foot&quot;); these lesions are often painless and may go unnoticed until bacterial infection supervenes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bunions (callused areas)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Wound evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of an existing diabetic foot ulcer includes careful examination and classification of the wound. The ulcer is observed for drainage, odor, the presence (or absence) of granulation tissue, and any exposed underlying structures, such as tendons, joint capsule, or bone. The wound can be probed gently by an experienced clinician or a surgeon with a sterile, blunt probe to reveal the presence of a sinus track or communication with deeper structures, which may change the wound classification.

Other physical examination findings, such as absence of pedal pulses and ankle brachial indices, were less reliable predictors of foot ulcers.</p><p>In another report, conventional clinical examination had low reproducibility compared with examination using a monofilament, and the latter was recommended for screening diabetic patients for neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive foot care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In conjunction with screening, counseling regarding preventive foot care should be given to any patient whose feet are at risk (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foot-care-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Foot care in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). There are a series of recommendations that can markedly diminish ulcer formation; they are particularly important in patients with existing neuropathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking, walking barefoot, the use of heating pads or hot water bottles, and stepping into a bath without checking the temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The toenails should be trimmed to the shape of the toe and filed to remove sharp edges.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The feet should be inspected daily, looking between and underneath the toes and at pressure areas for skin breaks, blisters, swelling, or redness. The patient may need to use a mirror or, if vision is impaired, have someone else perform the examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's shoes should fit properly and not be too tight, and the socks should be cotton, loose fitting, and changed every day. Patients who have misshapen feet or have had a previous foot ulcer may benefit from the use of special customized shoes. A prospective study found that shoe variables other than the recommendation for customized shoes (eg, style, width, length, or type of shoe) had no preventive effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The use of customized shoes, however, reduced the development of new foot ulcers from 58 to 28 percent over one year of follow-up in a second report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a third review, the use of a viscoelastic insole in conjunction with well-fitting shoes (whether customized, standard &quot;comfort,&quot; or athletic shoes) was associated with a decrease in plantar pressure; whether this results in a reduced incidence of foot ulcers remains to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The feet should be washed daily in lukewarm water. Mild soap should be used and the feet should be dried by gentle patting. A moisturizing cream or lotion should then be applied.</p><p/><p>A particularly effective strategy is to make specific recommendations to the patient in the form of a &quot;contract&quot; and to advise the patient to request that his or her feet be examined at every visit to the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In addition to the foot care measures described above, preliminary data suggest that home temperature monitoring may be effective in preventing foot ulceration in very high-risk patients (for example, those with severe neuropathy and a history of prior amputations or ulcers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Temperature monitoring involves daily or twice-daily measurements of skin surface temperature with a thermometer equipped with a touch sensor. If a temperature difference (elevation) is detected between a right and left foot site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52481\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52481 \">figure 1</a>), patients are instructed to reduce activity until the temperature normalizes. Whether the benefit of monitoring temperature is specifically related to the monitoring, or the heightened attention to foot care in those performing the monitoring, is not clear. Additional efficacy and feasibility studies are required before home temperature monitoring can be recommended to reduce the risk of foot ulcers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We largely agree with the guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which recommend the following with regard to foot care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a comprehensive foot examination annually on patients with diabetes to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputation.

The presence of erythema, warmth, or callus formation may indicate areas of tissue damage. Bony deformities, joint mobility, and gait and balance should also be assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test for loss of protective sensation using a 5.07 (10 g) monofilament at specific sites to detect loss of sensation in the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52481\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52481 \">figure 1</a>), plus any one of the following: vibration using a 128 Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, ankle reflexes, or vibration-perception threshold with a biothesiometer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screen for peripheral artery disease by asking about a history of claudication and assessing the pedal pulses.
