As a result, the previously used name, Lynch syndrome (after Dr. Henry Lynch, who did much to characterize and emphasize the importance of this familial syndrome), is being used more commonly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Lynch syndrome mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by a germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR): <em>MSH2</em>, <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH6</em>, <em>PMS2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Mutations in <em>MSH2</em> or <em>MLH1</em> are thought to account for about 90 percent of the heterozygous germline mutations that have been identified in patients with Lynch syndrome, <em>MSH6</em> mutations are thought to account for most of the remainder, and <em>PMS2</em> mutations have been described in relatively few Lynch families.</p><p>The risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer vary with the genotype; <em>MSH6</em> mutations are associated with a higher risk of endometrial cancer than <em>MLH1</em> and <em>MSH2</em> (71 versus 27 and 40 percent, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52285 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, there is so little known about ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome, and the number of cases available by mutation type is so small. Until more data are available, we do not recommend managing ovarian cancer prevention in women with Lynch syndrome differently based on mismatch repair mutation type.</p><p>Loss of mismatch repair can also occur in sporadic cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Somatic epigenetic changes such as promoter hypermethylation can silence gene expression and result in microsatellite instability (MSI). Approximately 20 percent of endometrial cancers are MSI-positive; less than 5 percent are thought attributable to Lynch syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A detailed discussion of the genetics of Lynch syndrome can be found separately.

In women with Lynch syndrome, the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer is 27 to 71 percent compared with 3 percent in the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57830\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57830 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Risk is between 27 and 60 percent for women with <em>MLH1</em> and <em>MSH2</em> mutations and 60 to 71 percent for those with mutations in <em>MSH6</em>. The mean age at endometrial cancer diagnosis in women with Lynch syndrome is 46 to 54 years, compared with a mean age of 60 years in other women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Some women with Lynch syndrome may develop endometrial cancer before age 40. As an example, in a study that included 69 women with Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancer, 18 percent were diagnosed under the age of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancers are of endometrioid histology, similar to sporadic endometrial cancer. However, non-endometrioid subtypes, including uterine serous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and uterine malignant mixed m&uuml;llerian tumors, have been reported in women with Lynch syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,24</a>].</p><p>Similar to women with sporadic endometrial cancer, the majority of Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancers are diagnosed with early-stage disease and thus, have a favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. As an example, a study in women with endometrial cancer that matched for age at diagnosis and cancer stage found similar five-year survival in 50 women with Lynch syndrome and 100 matched controls (88 versus 82 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>For women with Lynch syndrome, risk factors for the development of endometrial cancer appear to be the same as hormonal risk factors in the general population. As an example, a multicenter, international, retrospective cohort study of a registry of 1128 women with a mismatch repair gene mutation included 133 women who developed endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Later age at menarche (&ge;13 years), higher parity (&ge;1 live birth), and longer use of hormonal contraceptives (&ge;1 year) were associated with a decrease in the risk of endometrial cancer.</p><p>Endometrial tumor location, however, may differ in some women with Lynch syndrome. Endometrial cancer arises most commonly in the uterine corpus rather than the lower uterine segment (LUS) in all women, but in Lynch syndrome, there appears to be a higher proportion of LUS tumors. These tumors can be misdiagnosed as cervical adenocarcinoma. The largest series to investigate this included over 1000 women with endometrial cancer; 10 of 35 of the LUS tumors were found in women with Lynch syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. LUS tumors were higher grade and more invasive than corpus cancer. Thus, although LUS tumors account for a small number of Lynch-associated endometrial cancers, a finding of tumor at this site should prompt risk assessment for Lynch syndrome.

The majority of ovarian cancers in women with Lynch syndrome are epithelial serous, the most common histologic type among all ovarian cancer, but other subtypes, including endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Data from case-control studies show that women with Lynch syndrome are more likely to have stage I or II disease than the general population; however, there appears to be no difference in five-year overall survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) is also advised by experts, but likely does not improve screening efficacy when used in combination with sampling. The main role of TVUS in women with Lynch syndrome is ovarian cancer screening.</p><p>Screening strategies may differ in women depending on menopausal status. Women with Lynch syndrome often develop endometrial cancer before menopause; thus, screening premenopausal women is of particular importance. Unfortunately, screening and early detection is more difficult before menopause, since bleeding patterns and TVUS measurement of endometrial thickness are highly variable. In premenopausal women, a meta-analysis found that the sensitivity of endometrial biopsy is 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]; the sensitivity of TVUS for detection of endometrial cancer before menopause is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;, section on 'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, in postmenopausal women, the threshold for an abnormal endometrial thickness has been validated in several meta-analyses and thus, TVUS and endometrial sampling have similar sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Also, early detection is common because women with endometrial cancer typically present with bleeding.</p><p>However, investigations of these methods in the general population have been in symptomatic women rather than for screening. Also, Lynch syndrome is rare, and studies have not been large enough to separately evaluate diagnostic modalities in pre- and postmenopausal women.</p><p>Screening with endometrial biopsy was evaluated in 175 women age 35 or older with Lynch syndrome; TVUS, cervical cytology, and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) were also performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Median follow-up from the first surveillance visit was 3.7 years (range, 0 to 13 years). Screening biopsy detected nine women (5 percent) with endometrial cancers and 14 (8 percent) with endometrial hyperplasia, which is likely to become cancerous; the screening group included five other cancers, two detected by ultrasound, two as a result of symptoms, and one at the time of prophylactic hysterectomy. Women in the screening group were compared with 83 women with endometrial cancer from the same cancer registry who did not undergo surveillance; there were no statistically significant differences in cancer stage or 10-year mortality (0 of 14 versus 7 of 83). This difference was not statistically significant and may have been due to chance. However, if further studies find this difference to be real, a difference of this magnitude would be clinically significant. In the absence of better evidence, we favor screening.</p><p>However, in our view, the increase in cancer deaths in the no surveillance group is clinically significant and supports screening with endometrial biopsy versus detection by symptoms alone.</p><p>TVUS with the measurement of endometrial thickness has a high false-positive rate when used for endometrial cancer screening in women with Lynch syndrome, according to observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, these studies had methodological limitations, including a small number of participants and inclusion of women without confirmed Lynch syndrome. In postmenopausal women in the general population, TVUS and endometrial sampling have been shown to have similar sensitivity for detecting endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; these studies have been primarily in symptomatic women. Well-designed studies are needed to assess whether use of TVUS can be used as an alternative to sampling in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with Lynch syndrome.</p><p>Endometrial sampling combined with hysteroscopy detected three cases of endometrial cancer and three cases of endometrial hyperplasia among 62 women with Lynch syndrome who presented with abnormal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Another study of 41 women with Lynch syndrome found that endometrial sampling combined with hysteroscopy had a specificity for endometrial cancer of 89.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Further study is needed to assess whether this approach is superior to endometrial sampling alone in asymptomatic or symptomatic women.</p><p>In summary, endometrial sampling is the most commonly used endometrial screening modality in this population. However, there are few data regarding this or other approaches. Further investigation is needed, particularly studies that distinguish between pre- and postmenopausal women. Although endometrial sampling is a minor procedure, it is invasive. Thus, an outstanding question is whether TVUS measurement of endometrial thickness would be sufficient in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with Lynch syndrome.</p><p>In the absence of high-quality data and in consideration of both the high risk of endometrial cancer in these women and the availability of minimally invasive screening methods, we suggest annual endometrial sampling beginning at age 30 to 35 or 5 to 10 years prior to the earliest age of first diagnosis of Lynch-associated cancer of any kind in the family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Early detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early detection of endometrial cancer involves counseling women with Lynch syndrome to promptly seek medical attention for abnormal uterine bleeding.

It is not clear that screening for ovarian cancer reduces the morbidity or mortality of ovarian cancer in women with Lynch syndrome or other women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ovarian cancer screening is not performed in the general population, and reports from surveillance programs using screening in women at high risk due to a genetic predisposition or family history have been disappointing. The most promising strategies combine TVUS with the tumor marker CA125; such strategies are being investigated in two large trials. There are no data regarding ovarian cancer screening in women with Lynch syndrome with TVUS or CA125. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-ovarian-cancer#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'Multimodal screening'</a>.)</p><p>Ovarian cancer is less common than endometrial cancer in women with Lynch syndrome. However, as in the general population, women are most likely to present with advanced disease, and the prognosis is poor. Thus, in our view, in the absence of high-quality data, ovarian cancer screening with annual TVUS with or without CA125 every 6 to 12 months is a reasonable option in women with Lynch syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Early detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian cancer most commonly presents at an advanced stage. However, early symptoms are often present, and recognizing these can aid in earlier detection. Bloating, increased abdominal size, urinary urgency or frequency, difficulty eating or feeling full, and abdominal or pelvic pain occur in many gastrointestinal disorders, but are also common in women with ovarian cancer. In particular, ovarian cancer should be suspected when these symptoms coexist with other symptoms, occur almost daily, and are more severe than expected. Therefore, women with Lynch syndrome should be counseled to report this pattern of symptoms to their clinician.

However, in the general population, the Cancer and Steroid Hormone (CASH) case-control studies demonstrated a 50 percent reduction in the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer associated with the use of oral contraceptive pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In addition, progestin-containing agents have been shown to reverse or arrest disease progression in women with endometrial hyperplasia; however, these data do not address the role of progestins in prevention of endometrial cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chemoprevention for ovarian cancer is discussed in detail separately.

The largest study to evaluate this was a retrospective cohort study comparing women with germline <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH2,</em> or <em>MSH6</em> mutations who did or did not undergo hysterectomy with or without BSO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Sixty-one women who underwent hysterectomy (47 of whom also underwent BSO) were compared with age-matched controls. Median age at surgery was 41 years (range 20 to 63 years) and mean follow-up was 13 years after surgery. Only one patient who underwent surgery had an operative complication, a ureteral injury.</p><p>The incidence of endometrial or ovarian cancer was significantly lower in women who underwent risk-reducing surgery versus those who did not. No women who had a hysterectomy developed endometrial cancer compared with 33 percent (69 of 210) of the controls. No women in the BSO group developed ovarian cancer compared with 5 percent (12 of 233) of the controls; one ovarian cancer was diagnosed in a woman who had undergone hysterectomy. In addition to this well-designed study, more data are needed to confirm the role of prophylactic hysterectomy in preventing endometrial and ovarian cancer in women with Lynch syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Peritoneal cancer following prophylactic BSO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous studies in women with BRCA mutations have reported an incidence of peritoneal cancer following prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) of 0.6 to 1.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. There is one report of two cases of peritoneal cancer diagnosed 8 and 12 years following BSO in women with Lynch syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There are no guidelines for monitoring women with Lynch syndrome or other genetic cancer predispositions for peritoneal cancer following risk-reducing BSO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

At the time of surgery, the uterus, ovaries, and bowel should be carefully assessed. The pathologist should be advised of the high risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer and the specimens carefully examined intraoperatively with frozen sections performed if indicated. In addition, the surgeon should be prepared to perform a complete staging operation in the case of occult carcinoma.</p><p>There are no data comparing removal or conservation of the cervix (total versus subtotal hysterectomy) during prophylactic hysterectomy in women with Lynch syndrome. However, the cervix is a common route of spread for endometrial cancer and portions of the lower uterine segment may remain and develop cancer if the cervix is retained, thus making total hysterectomy the only reasonable surgical approach.</p><p>Surgical technique for risk-reducing gynecologic surgery is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-reducing-bilateral-salpingo-oophorectomy-in-women-at-high-risk-of-epithelial-ovarian-and-fallopian-tubal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women at high risk of epithelial ovarian and fallopian tubal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk-reducing gynecologic surgery at the time of colorectal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with Lynch syndrome are at risk of developing metachronous cancers, as noted in a preceding section (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Synchronous and metachronous cancers'</a> above). Thus, a woman who survives colon cancer has a high likelihood of developing endometrial or ovarian cancer. Patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer should be offered concurrent prophylactic hysterectomy and BSO.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks of prophylactic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disadvantages of prophylactic hysterectomy and BSO include surgical complications and premature menopause. The most common surgical complications associated with hysterectomy and BSO are bleeding, infection, and injuries to the urinary tract and bowel. These complications have been reported to occur in 1 to 9 percent of women undergoing hysterectomy and BSO for benign conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,53-55</a>].</p><p>Both endometrial and ovarian cancer are likely to develop before menopause in women with Lynch syndrome, and thus prophylactic surgery is most effective when performed in premenopausal women. The major clinical consequences of hysterectomy before menopause are sterility and cessation of menses. On the other hand, oophorectomy in these women leads to premature menopause and its associated risks, including menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, and possibly coronary heart disease, although this remains unclear. There is some debate about whether breast cancer might be part of the Lynch syndrome, although it is not included as part of the diagnostic group of Lynch-associated cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Thus it is likely that women with Lynch syndrome are appropriate candidates for estrogen therapy, but additional safety data are needed.</p><p>There are also data regarding detrimental effects of oophorectomy even after menopause, but these effects are unlikely to outweigh the benefits of ovarian cancer prevention in a high-risk population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy#H21231548\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A MANAGEMENT STRATEGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both screening for endometrial cancer with endometrial sampling and prophylactic hysterectomy appear effective for preventing endometrial cancer morbidity and mortality in women with Lynch syndrome; however, the two strategies have not been directly compared. Surgery is a definitive option, which incurs risk of perioperative morbidity and expense. On the other hand, sampling must be performed over years, with cumulative risks of infection and uterine perforation as well as time and cost. Also, among women who undergo screening, an expected 27 to 71 percent will develop endometrial cancer and require surgery in addition to prior years of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Cost-effectiveness analyses of management strategies for women with Lynch syndrome support use of prophylactic surgery rather than other surveillance and prevention methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].</p><p>Based on these factors, risk-reducing total hysterectomy appears to be an effective method for preventing endometrial cancer in women in this population and is preferable to other options. Given that the mean age of diagnosis of endometrial cancer in Lynch syndrome is 46 to 54 years, it is reasonable to delay hysterectomy until childbearing is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p>Whether to undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is less clear. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is lower than for endometrial cancer; however, ovarian cancer is likely to present at an advanced stage and have a poor prognosis. The lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in women with Lynch syndrome is 3 to 20 percent, and women who develop ovarian cancer are likely to do so while they are premenopausal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Therefore, prophylactic BSO before menopause will result in unnecessary premature menopause in 80 to 97 percent of women who undergo the surgery.</p><p>In premenopausal women with Lynch syndrome, we suggest risk-reducing BSO once childbearing is complete. Counseling regarding this option should include a discussion that weighs the increased risk of ovarian cancer and the limitations of ovarian cancer surveillance with the risks of premature menopause and possible short-term hormone replacement therapy use. In addition, we suggest BSO in women with Lynch syndrome who are postmenopausal.</p><p>Chemoprevention with oral contraceptive pills has not been compared with either surgery or surveillance.
