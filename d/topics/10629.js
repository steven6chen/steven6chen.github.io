The connective tissues make up and support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and other organs. People with Marfan syndrome have a problem with their connective tissues. Because of this, they can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have certain body features (listed below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have medical problems that can affect the heart, blood vessels, eyes, joints, and other parts of the body</p><p/><p>Marfan syndrome is a condition people are born with. It is caused by an abnormal gene. In most cases, people get Marfan syndrome because they get the abnormal gene from one or both of their parents. But in some cases, the abnormal gene does not come from either parent, but appears on its own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260299317\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the body features of Marfan syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with Marfan syndrome sometimes have certain body features that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tall, thin body type with long arms, legs, and fingers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest that sinks in or sticks out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A long head with eyes that look sunken in</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flat feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A curved spine, called scoliosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56860\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56860 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretch marks on the skin that were not caused by weight gain or loss</p><p/><p>But many people with these body features do not have Marfan syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260299355\"><span class=\"h1\">What medical problems does Marfan syndrome cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marfan syndrome can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the aorta, which is the big artery that carries blood from the heart to the body &ndash; These problems usually involve the first part of the aorta, called the aortic root. The walls of the aorta get weak and the aorta can widen. A widened aorta is called an aneurysm. This can lead to serious problems such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An &quot;aortic dissection&quot; &ndash; This is when the inner wall of the aorta tears.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An &quot;aortic rupture&quot; &ndash; This is when the widened aorta tears open completely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An aortic dissection or rupture is an emergency and can cause lots of internal bleeding. If this happens, the aorta might not supply enough blood to the body's organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart valve problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lung problem called a pneumothorax &ndash; This is when air leaks out of the lung and the lung collapses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64892\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64892 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260299399\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Marfan syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for Marfan syndrome, your doctor or nurse will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do an exam &ndash; He or she will look at your body features and look in your eyes with a special light.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask whether your family members have Marfan syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do a test called an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart as it beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 2</a>). It can show how wide your aorta is.</p><p/><p>He or she might also order a blood test to check for an abnormal gene. In some cases, this test helps tell whether you have Marfan syndrome.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will check for Marfan syndrome if you have body features of the condition. He or she might also check for Marfan syndrome if you have a closely-related family member with the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260299437\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Marfan syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and condition and can involve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular exams and tests to monitor your condition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to lower blood pressure &ndash; Keeping your blood pressure under control can help reduce the risk of problems with the aorta. A medicine called a &quot;beta blocker&quot; lowers the blood pressure and reduces the work of the heart. Your doctor might also add a second medicine, either an &quot;angiotensin receptor blocker&quot; or &quot;angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,&quot; to help lower your blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding certain kinds of exercise &ndash; Certain activities can increase the risk of problems with the aorta for people with Marfan syndrome. This includes contact sports, intense exercise, and things like straining to lift weights or do sit-ups. Ask your doctor which activities are OK and which to avoid. He or she can suggest ways to get exercise while reducing the risk of problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If your child has Marfan syndrome, talk with his or her school or caregiver about which activities are OK, and which should be avoided. If there is something your child can't do, for example in gym class, the school should have a plan for activities he or she might be able to do instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to fix your aorta before a serious problem happens</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency surgery to fix your aorta if an aortic dissection or rupture happens</p><p/><p>Other treatment depends on the problems you have. For example, people with eye problems need to be treated by an eye doctor, called an ophthalmologist. People with scoliosis might need to wear a back brace or have surgery to fix their spine.</p><p>You might find a support group for people with Marfan syndrome helpful. To find more information, you can go to The Marfan Foundation's website, <a href=\"http://www.marfan.org/&amp;token=jFSEf/MMkMBvUbfTzXx0L7S5to14Qc4BAH8gFu7qlK4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=87047\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.marfan.org</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260299452\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my family members be tested for Marfan syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have Marfan syndrome, your family members should be tested for the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260299467\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse before you start trying. If you or your partner has Marfan syndrome, you might pass on the gene that causes it to your child. You might want to talk with a genetic counselor, a person who specializes in genetic conditions.</p><p>Your doctor will also talk with you about possible problems women with Marfan syndrome can have during pregnancy and delivery. Pregnancy increases the chance of having an aortic dissection. Because of this, your doctor might recommend that you have surgery to fix your aorta before you try to get pregnant. He or she will also make sure that your medicines are safe to take during pregnancy.</p><p>During your pregnancy and delivery, you will be closely monitored by a team of specialists who have experience caring for pregnant women with Marfan syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260299482\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-dissection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Aortic dissection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-collapsed-lung-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=scoliosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Scoliosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thoracic aortic aneurysm (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
