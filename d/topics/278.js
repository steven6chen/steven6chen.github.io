Most of the time, it is caused by a reaction to certain medicines. These include medicines that treat pain, infections, and other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83922 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Diseases that involve the body's infection-fighting system (called &quot;autoimmune diseases&quot;) and infections can also cause acute interstitial nephritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6716295\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acute interstitial nephritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms. But symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throwing up (vomiting)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash &ndash; This looks like small, flat red bumps and can happen anywhere on the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine that looks cloudy or red</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6716310\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for acute interstitial nephritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p>Sometimes, a doctor might do a kidney &quot;biopsy.&quot; For this test, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from your kidney to look at under the microscope. Usually, the doctor will get this sample by inserting a needle straight through the skin in the back and into the kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6716325\"><span class=\"h1\">How is acute interstitial nephritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people get better after they stop the medicine that caused the condition. Some people also take medicines called steroids. These medicines help reduce inflammation. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes use illegally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6716340\"><span class=\"h1\">Can acute interstitial nephritis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who take the medicines that can cause acute interstitial nephritis do NOT get it. But if you have had acute interstitial nephritis in the past, you can reduce your chances of getting it again by avoiding the medicine that caused it the first time.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
