It is an important cause of infection in three populations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates &ndash; GBS infection is acquired in utero or during passage through the vagina. The most common manifestations of neonatal disease are bacteremia without a focus, sepsis, pneumonia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meningitis.

However, the incidence increases with age and has been reported to be as high as 26 per 100,000 in patients &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,8</a>]. Moreover, in the United States, the incidence among adults appears to have increased over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a population-based surveillance study among adults in Northern California, the incidence of invasive GBS infection increased from 5.8 to 8.3 cases per 100,000 adults between 1995 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Increased incidence was observed particularly among individuals older than 40 years and for infections of the skin, soft tissue, joints, and bone. </p><p>In view of the increased reported incidence among adults and the reductions in GBS infection in neonates and pregnant women, GBS infection in adults is now estimated to account for over three-fourths of invasive GBS disease in the United States and for 90 percent of the mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87797\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87797 \">figure 1</a>). At least 1300 GBS-related deaths occurred among elderly persons in 2003; the case fatality rate for elderly adults is estimated at 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for the development of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many groups have attempted to characterize the adult hosts most susceptible to invasive GBS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,3,10-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,10-17</a>]. GBS in the gastrointestinal tract is a risk factor for vaginal GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In most reports, the infection is equally prevalent in men and women, and some have found a higher rate in African Americans than Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,3,4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,10</a>].</p><p>Diabetes mellitus, malignancy, HIV infection, and advanced hepatic and renal disease have been identified as risk factors for invasive GBS infection in population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,3,10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,10,15</a>]. Some studies have also reported higher rates of GBS infection in patients with alcoholism, cardiovascular disease, collagen vascular disease (with or without steroid use), and trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The risk is markedly increased in the elderly, particularly nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>].</p><p>A case control study compared patients with invasive GBS infections to patients hospitalized for other illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. On multivariate analysis, the odds ratios (OR) were highest for the following independent risk factors: cirrhosis (OR 9.7), diabetes mellitus (OR 3.0), stroke (OR 3.5), breast cancer (OR 4.0), decubitus ulcer, (OR 4.0) and neurogenic bladder (OR 4.6). Nosocomial infection, which accounted for 22 percent of these cases, was associated strongly with central venous line placement (OR 30.9), and less strongly with diabetes, congestive heart failure, and seizure disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Carriage of the organism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no obvious immunodeficiency common to patients with the above underlying conditions. Some of these illnesses may simply predispose to bacterial invasion because of a loss of barrier protection in a chronically colonized site. GBS has been isolated from cultures of the human rectum, vagina, cervix, urethra, skin, and pharynx.</p><p>Women of childbearing age have been most intensively studied for GBS colonization; vaginal and rectal cultures are positive for the organism in 5 to 40 percent of these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The carriage rate increases with parity, is inversely correlated with age, and is lower in Mexican-Americans than in African Americans or Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The rate of colonization in healthy young men and women was evaluated in a report of 462 college students living in a dormitory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. GBS colonization at one or more site (urine, vagina, anal orifice, throat) was present in 34 percent of the women and 20 percent of the men. The colonization rate was twice as high in sexually experienced compared to inexperienced students, suggesting that GBS may be transmitted by sexual contact.</p><p>GBS colonization rates have been reported in a number of other groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nursing home residents and staff &ndash; positive rectal cultures for GBS in 12 and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male homosexuals &ndash; rectal GBS carriage in 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A possibly lower carriage rate in diabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], even though the incidence of invasive infection is substantially increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotyping of invasive strains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some efforts have been made to identify the strains of GBS involved in infections in nonpregnant adults. GBS are classified into serotypes based upon structural differences in capsular polysaccharides (Ia, Ib, and II-IX) and the presence or absence of surface protein antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcus: Virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One report comparing the serotype frequency in infants and adults found a predominance of serotype III and serotype Ia, with fewer isolates of serotypes II and V in infant infections. By contrast, the major isolate in adults was serotype V, accounting for 29 percent of the organisms; there were smaller numbers of isolates of serotypes <span class=\"nowrap\">Ia/c,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">Ib/c,</span> and III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Other reports confirm the predominance of serotype V in adult invasive GBS infections and suggest an increasing prevalence of this serotype in perinatal GBS infections as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/4,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29</a>]. Serotypes of GBS colonizing pregnant women have been found to differ in Japanese women, with a high proportion colonized with types VI and VIII, two serotypes rarely found in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Emergence of type VIII has been described in Denmark as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Serotypes of GBS causing adult infection also probably differ in diverse geographic regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNDROMES AND SITES OF CLINICAL INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A broad spectrum of adult GBS infections has been documented in the literature, both in hospital-based case reports and case series and in population-based surveys. Of these infections, 20 to 70 percent are nosocomial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and soft tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin and soft tissue infections account for 15 to 40 percent of all bacteremic episodes in population-based surveys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. Included in this group are foot and decubitus ulcers, cellulitis, abscesses, necrotizing fasciitis, balanitis, and sternal wound infections after coronary artery bypass grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Several cases of necrotizing fasciitis associated with a toxic shock-like syndrome have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Cellulitis is the most frequent clinical manifestation of GBS-associated skin and soft tissue infections. Conditions such as lymphedema, vascular insufficiency, chronic dermatitis, or radiation-induced cutaneous injury are frequent predisposing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Post-coital GBS-associated sepsis and thigh cellulitis following sexual intercourse has been described in women with vaginal GBS colonization and predisposing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteremia without clear source</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary bacteremias comprise 30 to 40 percent of invasive GBS episodes in population-based surveys and are fatal in 20 to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].

One group found a mean of 16.5 days elapsed between admission and evidence of infection; 81 percent of deaths occurred less than 48 hours after the first blood culture isolate of GBS, despite appropriate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another study also reported high mortality in inpatients with nosocomial GBS infections but found that most of the deaths were attributable to the underlying disease, which prompted the admission, and to a prolonged hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinary tract is the source of 5 to 15 percent of invasive GBS isolates in population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].

However, most of these infections are polymicrobial; GBS is most frequently isolated along with Staphylococcus aureus. A large number of these pneumonias are nosocomial, occur in elderly adults, and have case fatality rates in excess of 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].</p><p>Occasionally GBS is isolated in throat cultures of patients with pharyngitis.

The majority of these infections are osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. Most are community-acquired and develop in large joints, which were already abnormal from prior arthritis, traumatic injury, or joint replacement surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In a retrospective review of patients with septic arthritis in Thailand from 1990 to 2010, GBS was an emerging cause of septic arthritis in the later years of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Endocarditis mainly occurs on native valves, involving the left-sided valves more commonly than the right-sided, and often associated with large, friable vegetations. The typical host in the pre-antibiotic era was a young woman with rheumatic heart disease in the period postpartum or post-abortion. However, the most frequent patient with GBS endocarditis currently is over 50 years old. Young postpartum women constitute a large proportion of patients who develop GBS bacteremia but this group does not commonly develop endocarditis in the absence of pre-existing valvular heart disease.</p><p>Mortality from GBS endocarditis, whether it presents as an acute or subacute infection, may reach 40 percent, suggesting that GBS valve infections are more virulent than those caused by most other streptococcal species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

These mortality rates are similar to those associated with staphylococcal endocarditis. Some groups believe that early surgery should be considered, as there is some suggestion that combined medical-surgical therapy yields better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The syndrome was defined by the presence of septic shock, multi-organ failure, and GBS isolation from a normally sterile site. All of the patients were adults and many had underlying comorbidities. The mortality rate was &gt;50 percent. Only 3 of the 19 developed rash. These patients had GBS isolates with serotypes and susceptibility patterns that were similar to each other but distinct from isolates of infants and vaginal swabs from women with invasive disease.

However, antigen testing of other body fluids is not recommended.</p><p>Most GBS infections in adults have no distinctive features that would lead the clinician to suspect that this pathogen would be isolated.

The mean interval between infections was significantly shorter for the 13 patients (72 percent) with the same strain by molecular genetic analysis than for those who had a different strain (14 versus 43 weeks). Relapsed or recurrent infection could have arisen from ongoing gastrointestinal or genitourinary carriage, reinfection from a contact, or an inadequate course of treatment for the initial infection. </p><p>A subsequent study of nonpregnant adult patients in Taiwan, reported a 9.3 percent recurrence rate, with the urinary tract as the most common site of recurrence and serotype V as the most common serotype associated with recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

One of the earliest series found only 8 percent mortality, but as many as 25 percent of the cases were postpartum women, who generally have better outcomes than other adults with this pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other later studies, which assessed adult disease outside of the peripartum period, report mortality rates of 15 to 38 percent, representing up to 90 percent of all GBS-related deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,3,13,16,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,13,16,27</a>]. Factors associated with worse outcome include: age over 65 years, CNS disease, alcoholism, shock, renal failure, impaired level of consciousness, and confinement to bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/4,22,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22,70</a>].

To date, such vaccines have been synthesized and shown to be immunogenic in animal models. In addition, healthy adults have safely received conjugate vaccines prepared with GBS types Ia, Ib, II, III, and V capsular polysaccharides in Phase I and II clinical trials, with results suggesting these conjugate vaccines can effectively prevent invasive GBS disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccines for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vaccination is likely to be effective in neonates and in pregnant women, since these groups have been noted to have low titers of antibody directed against GBS capsular polysaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. However, there are some data indicating that adult patients with invasive GBS infection have levels of serum capsular antibody that are high enough to be protective against infection in neonates. One group described 12 patients with invasive GBS infection who had serum collected within 48 hours of the first positive blood culture. Seven of these patients had high levels of IgG against the specific serotype of GBS causing their infection, and these antibodies mediated opsonophagocytic killing of GBS effectively in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. It is difficult to determine whether the levels of antibody were high at the time of initial infection, or whether they rose rapidly in response to infection.</p><p>However, these data suggest that antibody deficiency to capsular polysaccharide may not be the only reason for susceptibility to infection in adult GBS disease. If this is true, then vaccine development to raise capsular polysaccharide-directed antibody levels may be less than fully effective for preventing invasive GBS disease in adults. Another group has described low levels of serotype V-specific antibody among healthy elderly people, suggesting that the levels may rise during the course of infection and that this population might benefit from vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].
