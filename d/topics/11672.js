One study also found that the presence of asymptomatic stroke detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperatively was also a risk factor for perioperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The timing of the prior stroke (more or less recent) did not influence perioperative stroke risk, according to one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Aortic atherosclerosis is also an important risk factor, with an associated odds ratio of 4.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a review of 921 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery, the incidence of stroke was 8.7 percent in those with aortic atherosclerosis, compared with 1.8 percent in those without this abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among patients with aortic atherosclerosis, the risk of stroke is greatest in those with aortic arch atheromas that are mobile or protrude &ge;5 mm into the aortic lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/36,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,44</a>]. Large atheromas are more likely to occur at the site of new aortic injury during surgical clamping and cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Large or mobile atheromas are also risk factors for stroke in patients not undergoing surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The data associating carotid disease with perioperative stroke in patients are more limited. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with cerebrovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of any one risk factor for stroke is not considered a contraindication for cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A number of risk models have been developed to predict stroke after cardiac surgery (usually CABG) using preoperative risk factors. While these models vary substantively, they emphasize the additive effect that individual risk factors have on perioperative stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p>Operative factors are also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Closed chamber procedures, such as CABG, have a lower risk than open chamber procedures, such as valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. This difference was demonstrated in a multicenter prospective trial of 273 patients in which the rate of cerebral complications (predominantly stroke) was 6 percent in patients undergoing CABG compared with 16 percent in patients undergoing intracardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Combined or complex surgical procedures, including those that are prolonged and involve manipulation of the ascending aorta, increase the risk of neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Increasing the temperature of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may also augment the risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of cerebral infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different mechanisms are thought to be responsible for early onset or intraoperative ischemic stroke versus delayed ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/26,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral hypoperfusion and atheroembolization are understood to be the major mechanisms underlying intraoperative stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral hypoperfusion can result from intraoperative hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diminished cardiac output. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that decreased blood flow during surgery results in diminished washout of embolic material from blood vessels in the brain, particularly in borderzone (watershed) areas along the boundaries of major vascular territories, predisposing to ischemia in these regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These mechanisms may combine to increase the cumulative risk of injury in cardiac surgery and explain the presence of postoperative strokes identified as having multiple mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While mean arterial pressures of 50 to 70 mmHg are common and typically well tolerated by patients during CPB, higher mean arterial blood pressure may decrease both cardiac and neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This and other techniques to avoid intraoperative cerebral hypoperfusion are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H2404403984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'Mean arterial pressure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H2080789434\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'Cerebrovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial emboli can cause transient or permanent occlusion of cerebral vessels and produce cerebral ischemia. This appears to be the predominant cause of intraoperative stroke, as is supported by the finding that most patients with stroke have multiple cerebral infarcts in different arterial territories on neuroimaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/26,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Three major types of emboli occur during cardiac operations: thromboemboli, atheroemboli, and air emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thrombi or atheromatous debris can be released from complex aortic plaques during clamping and unclamping of the ascending aorta, constructing the proximal coronary artery bypass graft anastomoses in the ascending aorta, excising severely calcified and diseased cardiac valves, or by turbulent high-velocity blood flow from the aortic cannula within a diseased aorta. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the middle cerebral artery blood flow detects arterial microemboli entering the cerebral circulation during cardiac surgery; these are most frequent during placement and removal of the aortic cross-clamp and the aortic cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation#H627668994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Preparations and initiation&quot;, section on 'Aortic cannulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Gaseous emboli enter the arterial circulation via open cardiac chambers, vascular cannulation sites, or arterial anastomoses. These may be the most common type of embolic material seen during CBP; however, the impact that these have on neurologic injury and outcome is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The size of the gaseous emboli may be important, with larger emboli-causing strokes and smaller emboli resulting in endothelial injury in the brain's vasculature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular procedures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stroke that is noted after an initial uneventful neurologic recovery from surgery is most likely to be due to cardiogenic embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Atrial fibrillation, a common postoperative complication, is believed to contribute to a significant proportion of delayed postoperative strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/17,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,54</a>]. Underlying heart disease also likely plays an important role. As in other clinical settings, the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score helps stratify the risk for postoperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary intracranial hemorrhage in patients is a rare complication of cardiac surgery; most intracranial hemorrhage in this setting occurs as a complication of ischemic infarction.</p><p>Although 5 percent of patients with perioperative ischemic strokes have some hemorrhagic transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], the incidence of sizable hemorrhages with mass effect is much smaller. The risk factors for significant hemorrhage include large infarcts, anticoagulation within 12 hours of an infarction, or the presence of an infarct that is already hemorrhagic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In any patient with prior intracranial hemorrhage undergoing a cardiac operation, it is imperative to perform a neurologic examination as soon as possible postoperatively to determine whether there is clinical evidence of increasing hemorrhage that might require neurosurgical intervention.</p><p>Patients with endocarditis often have ongoing neurologic injury, which puts them at greater risk of intracranial hemorrhage during anticoagulation for CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This risk may be reduced by delaying the operation for two to three weeks while antibiotic therapy is initiated; however, hemodynamic instability may preclude delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Another method to reduce bleeding risk is to perform cardiac surgery with a heparin-bonded CPB circuit, which permits reduced systemic heparinization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ophthalmologic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial emboli can cause symptomatic ophthalmologic complications. Intraoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography demonstrated transient microvascular occlusion in all 21 patients studied in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In a larger series of 312 patients undergoing CABG, 26 percent experienced neuroophthalmologic sequelae, including 17 percent with retinal infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Visual loss due to ischemic optic neuropathy is uncommon, occurring in approximately 0.1 percent of patients undergoing CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>A supranuclear gaze palsy is another described complication of cardiac surgery, particularly aortic valve replacement and repair of an ascending aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. This is probably under-recognized as the patient's complaints are often somewhat vague, and demonstration of the neurologic deficit requires specific examination of vertical and horizontal saccades. Spastic dysarthria, emotional lability, and gait disorder are frequent accompanying abnormalities. The presumed mechanism is ischemic injury to the midbrain, or elsewhere in the brainstem, but this has not been specifically documented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients stable enough to undergo brain MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is very sensitive and accurate for the diagnosis of acute ischemic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition to confirming the presence of a cerebral infarction, it is useful to identify additional, otherwise unsuspected areas of infarction and may hint at the underlying mechanism, that is, embolism versus watershed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is also important to confirm the timing of the stroke. A stroke that occurs postoperatively suggests the potential for recurrent events due to ongoing risk factors, such as atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, intramural thrombus in the heart, or inadequate anticoagulation for a mechanical valve prosthesis. An intraoperative stroke is less likely to recur.</p><p>Potential interventions for the treatment of stroke after cardiac surgery are discussed in detail separately but include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of blood pressure in acute stroke has not been well studied. In other settings (not postoperative), blood pressure lowering is not recommended unless in excess of 220 mmHg systolic or 120 mmHg diastolic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], or unless the patient is suffering from, or at risk of, aortic dissection, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or other adverse effects. After cardiac surgery, surgeons may recommend somewhat lower blood pressures. Hypotension should be avoided and treated if it occurs using supine posture and an intravenous fluid bolus. If these measures are insufficient, a pressor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> at low dose may be useful. Although there is no support in the literature for blood pressure augmentation in normotensive patients, it is our general practice to treat these patients with judicious use of volume expansion to improve brain perfusion.

In one series of 40 patients undergoing intracardiac surgery, comparison of preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and neuropsychologic testing found that postoperative decline in cognitive function was associated with the presence and severity of new ischemic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. However, other studies have not confirmed this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similarly, studies have not shown a causal association between the presence or number of microemboli detected during surgery and the postoperative cognitive impairment or pathologic change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/78,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,91</a>]. </p><p>Intraoperative hypotension and prolonged oxygen desaturations may also contribute to cerebral injury and subsequent neurocognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

The main predictor of cognitive decline at five years were neurocognitive deficits at discharge.</p><p>However, accumulating evidence suggests that the cause of late decline in cognitive function occurring one to five years after CABG is progression of underlying cerebrovascular disease or vascular dementia rather than CABG or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery/abstract/4,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,86</a>].

Although this distribution is expected with ulnar nerve injury at the elbow, similar symptoms are associated with injury to the lower (medial) brachial plexus elements. Overall, brachial plexus injury is more common than isolated ulnar nerve deficits after cardiac surgery.</p><p>Weakness in muscles supplied by the lower cervical nerve roots but not the ulnar nerve, such as the extensor indicis and abductor pollicis brevis, indicates a plexopathy.
