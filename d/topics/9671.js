One area of concern is the size of the labia minora, although a variation is size is consistent with normal anatomy. Clinical labia minora hypertrophy remains a poorly defined diagnosis. Interest in surgical correction of vulvar appearance may be associated with trends in pubic hair removal, exposure to idealized images of genital anatomy through digital applications or websites, and awareness of cosmetic vulvovaginal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertrophy of the labia minora will be reviewed here. Congenital anomalies of the reproductive tract and vulvovaginal discomfort syndromes are discussed separately.

This issue is usually brought to medical attention due to vulvar discomfort, functional symptoms (interference with activities), or concern about vulvar appearance. Discussion with the patient about symptoms and a physical examination help to guide management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2869252518\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1582017544\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertrophy of one or both labia minora can result in irritation, chronic infection, poor hygiene, or pain. In addition, the patient may complain that the labia interfere with activities including walking or sitting, sexual activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sports (eg, running, cycling, horseback riding, or swimming). A woman may describe discomfort with the fact that there is a &quot;bulge&quot; in her underwear. She may report that she needs to &quot;fold up&quot; her labia and push them into the vagina to reduce the bulge.</p><p>Concerns about the appearance of the labia minora can result in considerable emotional distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Given the physical and emotional changes that accompany puberty, adolescent girls are a particularly vulnerable group. For example, girls may become very self-conscious about the size of the labia if they need to change their clothes in the presence of their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. It is also important to make sure that it is the girl who is distressed, <strong>not</strong> anyone else (eg, parents, peers, sexual partner).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247450850\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychological screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises that adolescents seeking labial surgery should be screened for body dysmorphic disorder and referred to a mental health professional if appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study, 9 of 49 women who underwent labioplasty met criteria for body dysmorphic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A screening questionnaire is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96647 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2394381565\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic approach is utilized for the gynecologic examination. It is helpful for the clinician to be experienced with the pelvic examination and the normal variants of the external female genitalia.</p><p>The external genitalia are inspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614 \">figure 1</a>). The hair distribution, skin, labia major and minora, clitoris, urethral meatus, introitus, perineal body, and anus are evaluated. In particular, the labia minora should be fully extended laterally, inspected for asymmetry, and measured from the midline to the lateral free edge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51816 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The gynecologic examination is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;, section on 'History and physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Labial width</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Labia minora hypertrophy is generally described as protuberant labial tissue that projects beyond the labia majora. However, there is no consensus among gynecologists, pediatricians, or plastic surgeons regarding the use of objective clinical measurements to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>To examine the labia minora to evaluate for hypertrophy, the labia should be gently extended to their full width in the medial-lateral axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51816 \">picture 1</a>). The measurement of this width is the &quot;stretch width.&quot;</p><p>In an early description of this condition, Friedrich classified labia minora as hypertrophic when the maximal width between the midline and the lateral free edge of the labia minora (when the labia were extended laterally by the examiner) measured greater than 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Others have proposed that the normal width of the labia minora should be less than 3 to 4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In current practice, a stretch width of greater than 6 cm is generally felt to be consistent with hypertrophy.</p><p>On the other hand, some have argued that patients should be offered surgical correction if they present with persistent symptoms, regardless of measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H787321205\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of labia minora hypertrophy is a clinical one. In general, the diagnosis is based upon the presence of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distress associated with labia minora that are within the size range considered hypertrophic.</p><p>There are no standard diagnostic criteria for labia minora hypertrophy. Clinicians generally use labial width (measurement of medial-lateral axis of the labia minora when gently stretched to full width) measurements. Although there are no &quot;standards&quot; for normal labial width, there can be a wide variation in &quot;normal.&quot; A stretch width of greater than 6 cm is generally felt to be consistent with hypertrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to management is patient counseling and self-care instruction. If symptoms persist after extensive counseling and instruction in vulvar care, then surgical correction may be offered. Patients should be aware that surgical correction may result in scarring and potentially lead to chronic vulvar pain and dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, surgery is considered elective and cosmetic results vary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most often, concerns regarding labial asymmetry or hypertrophy can be alleviated through reassurance that variation in size is a variant of normal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Some adolescents or women may have seen photos of modified vulvas on the internet, and this may impact their perception of normal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. An excellent website for women to be able to observe the variation of normal can be found at the Large Labia Project, which has self-taken images submitted by women around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>As noted above, the patient should be screened for body dysmorphic disorder and referred for treatment, if appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96647 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2247450850\" class=\"local\">'Psychological screening'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1243213069\"><span class=\"h2\">Managing functional symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional symptoms can often be conservatively managed through counseling about vulvar hygiene (eg, use of mild soaps, avoiding irritants, use of &quot;natural&quot; sanitary pads that do not contains chemicals) and avoidance of form-fitting clothing, especially thongs or tight-fitting underwear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64538\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64538 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2869252518\" class=\"local\">'Medical history'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-dermatitis#H1629819770\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar dermatitis&quot;, section on 'General measures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Labioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of labioplasty is resection of the hypertrophic tissue and creation of symmetrically reduced labia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Surgical correction of labia minora hypertrophy is reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms despite counseling and vulvar care instruction and who have been screened and found not to have body dysmorphic disorder.</p><p>This procedure may be performed in adolescence, if indicated, but it is our experience that the minimum age should be 15 to 16 to avoid the need for a second operation if the labia continue to grow. The emotional maturity level of the adolescent should also be evaluated when determining the appropriate age for a surgical procedure. Decisions regarding surgical treatment of preadolescent or adolescent girls require involvement of a parent or guardian. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several techniques have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The main techniques are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A curvilinear excisional or straight line procedure using an anterior-posterior incision of the protuberant labial tissue and oversewing of the incised edge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83179\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83179 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is the simplest technique and our usual procedure of choice. We typically use an interrupted suture of 4-0 vicryl.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, we use the curvilinear technique because it has the fastest recovery and usually is associated with excellent results. It should be noted, however, that the labial edges may be replaced with scarred suture lines that cause chronic irritation and discomfort. Furthermore, the natural contour of the labia minora may be compromised. Of note, if this technique is used, great care should be taken to avoid the area of the clitoris and the clitoral hood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other techniques have been described that attempt to preserve the natural contour of the labia minora and reduce the amount of exposed scar tissue. These alternative techniques involve a wedge resection with subsequent reanastomosis. While maintaining symmetry, a V-shaped segment is carefully resected. The raw edges are reapproximated using interrupted or a running subcuticular fine absorbable suture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73368\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73368 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/2,3,6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,18</a>]. If we use this technique, we typically use an interrupted suture of 3-0 vicryl. In one case series, labioplasty was performed using an Nd:YAG laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A disadvantage of the V-shaped excision technique, in our experience, is that there are cases in which there is extensive prolonged swelling, most likely from an adverse effect on lymphatic drainage.</p><p/><p>There are few comparative data regarding surgical techniques for labioplasty. In one study of 24 patients, there were higher rates of complications with straight line amputation compared with wedge resection, including wound infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">pruritus/dryness,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">discoloration/poor</span> aesthetic result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3440009975\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential complications of labioplasty include infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There are few data regarding the rate of complications following labioplasty. In two large case series (n = 407 and 163), reoperation rates were 2.9 and 7 percent; indications for reoperation were wound dehiscence or dissatisfaction with appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/6,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperatively, the patient should keep the area clean and dry, avoid strenuous activity, wear loose clothing, and protect the vulvar area from friction for 7 to 14 days. An athletic support cup may be worn inside the patient's underwear to reduce the risk of friction and disruption of the suture line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, in our experience, use of a support cup postoperatively may result in a slower recovery and a higher chance of suture wound breakdown, although no long-term follow-up studies have been published.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Labioplasty is a simple surgical procedure that can be associated with a high degree of patient satisfaction. There are few studies of labioplasty outcomes; representative studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest labioplasty case series (n = 163), the majority of women underwent bilateral surgical correction using a V-shaped wedge resection technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common motives for surgical correction were aesthetic complaints, discomfort with certain types of clothing, entry dyspareunia, and difficulty participating in athletic activities. Most women reported relief of discomfort (96 percent) and aesthetic improvement (91 percent). There were no major perioperative complications. Minor complications were temporary (median duration 28 days) and included postoperative discomfort (45 percent) and entry dyspareunia (23 percent). Eleven patients (7 percent) underwent a second procedure because of small wound dehiscences, which compromised the aesthetic result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 26 women who underwent labioplasty, most reported functional success (much to very much improved: 54 percent versus no change: 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/labia-minora-hypertrophy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Improvement on a genital appearance satisfaction scale was found in 96 percent (24 of 25) at three months. At 11 to 42 months, 91 percent had improvement on the genital appearance scale and 26 percent reported adverse effects (eg, aesthetic concerns, discomfort, urinary spraying, or reduced sexual arousal).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
