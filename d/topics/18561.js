Clinical symptoms vary widely. The various vasculitic syndromes are defined by both the type of pathologic inflammation and the type and location of the vessels and this, in turn, determines which specific organs are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The first priorities in management of a child with vasculitis are prompt recognition and timely treatment since many of the vasculitides can be severe and life-threatening conditions if not appropriately managed. Specific treatments are determined by the type of vasculitis, the severity of the inflammation, and the particular organ systems affected.</p><p>A general overview of the management of vasculitis in children is reviewed here. The classification and the approach to evaluating childhood vasculitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following principles are important to consider when managing a child with vasculitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiating vasculitis from other diseases that can either mimic vasculitis or cause secondary vasculitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defining disease activity and severity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weighing the benefits and risks of therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Differentiating vasculitis from other diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In treating a child with vasculitis, it is critical to distinguish primary vasculitis from other diseases that can mimic vasculitis, as well as from conditions causing secondary vasculitis, such as infections, drugs, malignancies, or connective tissue diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile dermatomyositis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Making an accurate diagnosis is necessary to ensure that the appropriate therapy is initiated and to prevent the administration of medications that may be contraindicated. In children with secondary vasculitis, therapy is directed at treating the underlying disease (eg, infection or other rheumatic disorders). Thus, administration of immunosuppressive therapy may be appropriate in patients with primary vasculitis but may have adverse (even catastrophic) consequences in a patient with secondary vasculitis due to a systemic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The disorders that may mimic vasculitis or cause secondary vasculitis are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Differentiating primary vasculitis from other disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of disease activity plays an important role in the treatment of the systemic vasculitides, both in interpreting the results of therapeutic studies and in directing the care for individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients may fall into one of three categories of active disease or may be in remission.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active disease</strong> &ndash; A patient has active disease when there is objective evidence of ongoing inflammation. However, determining this is not always straightforward, because there is a lack of reliable disease-activity markers for many types of systemic vasculitis. In addition, distinguishing active disease from chronic sequelae of the disease (irreversible damage), medication toxicity, and concomitant or secondary processes, such as infection, may be difficult. Because of the lack of reliable markers, assessment of disease activity often relies upon the clinical judgment of the treating clinician(s) based upon clinical findings (eg, signs, symptoms, disease tempo, and laboratory markers of inflammation, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein). The ability to detect and quantify disease activity is important as it impacts upon therapeutic choices. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The three categories of active disease are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>New-onset disease</strong> &ndash; Disease at the time of diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Relapsing disease</strong> &ndash; When disease activity recurs following remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Refractory disease</strong> &ndash; Worsening disease or persisting disease activity with limited improvement after a period of appropriate therapy (eg, within a few days for Kawasaki disease after two treatments with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> or within 6 to 12 weeks of standard &quot;remission induction&quot; therapy for chronic diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly Wegener granulomatosis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Remission</strong> &ndash; A patient is in remission when there is persistent evidence of the lack of active disease. The duration of required inactivity for remission has not been universally defined and varies considerably within the literature. In some studies, remission may be as short as three months for chronic vasculitides (eg, Takayasu arteritis) and 24 hours for acute conditions, such as Kawasaki disease. Remission may be further qualified as remission on or off medications.</p><p/><p>In the management of childhood vasculitis, treatment is determined by the phase of disease activity as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Induction therapy</strong> &ndash; Therapy is directed at stopping the inflammatory process in a newly diagnosed patient and putting the patient into remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maintenance therapy</strong> &ndash; Once the patient is in remission, therapy may be continued to maintain remission. In some cases, especially in diseases that are generally acute and self-limited (eg, Kawasaki disease), maintenance therapy may not be necessary, and the patient may be in remission off medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Relapse therapy</strong> &ndash; Therapy that is required to treat a reactivation of the inflammatory process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Refractory therapy</strong> &ndash; Increased therapy requirement for patients not responding to standard therapy, which may include alternative or additional immunosuppression or biologic response modifiers. (See appropriate topic reviews for each specific vasculitis disorder.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Weighing the benefits and risks of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When deciding upon therapy for any given vasculitis, one must weigh the benefits of a specific therapy and its potential adverse effects against the consequences of allowing the vascular inflammation to follow its natural history. Treatment of the rarer chronic vasculitides is best supervised by clinicians (eg, pediatric rheumatologists) with knowledge of the diseases, medications used to treat them, and their implications in a developing child. The importance of judiciously balancing the short- and long-term risks of treatment against the short- and long-term outcome of untreated disease cannot be overstated.</p><p>Some vasculitides, such as immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), are acute and usually self-limited and uncomplicated. In these cases, it is usually unnecessary to even consider the use of potentially toxic therapies.</p><p>Other vasculitides, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, follow a chronic relapsing course with ongoing serious morbidity and mortality risk due to end-stage renal disease and pulmonary hemorrhage. In such patients, long-term immunosuppressive therapy may be warranted in an attempt to halt disease progression.</p><p>Children require special consideration regarding both short-term and long-term calculations of treatment risks and benefits. Both the disease and its treatments affect physical, social, educational, and emotional development and can have long-term consequences. Children are presumed to have a long life expectancy ahead of them, so the significance of potentially lifesaving treatment is magnified. On the other hand, children's developing organ systems are at risk of insidiously accruing a high toxic burden from therapies. With time, the potential long-term toxicities (eg, infertility, malignancy, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis) have a greater chance to manifest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Key questions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of primary vasculitic syndromes will vary based upon the answers to the following key questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the disease active? Differentiate active disease from chronic sequelae of disease, medication toxicity, and other diseases, particularly infection.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Differentiating primary vasculitis from other disorders'</a> and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Defining disease activity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How severe is the active disease? Fulminant life-threatening disease or critical organ-threatening disease requires more aggressive management.

Certain sites of organ involvement may not require or may not respond to systemic immunosuppressive therapy. As an example, subglottic stenosis in granulomatosis with polyangiitis may be more appropriately treated with local therapy (eg, local glucocorticoid injections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mechanical dilation) than with systemic medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the nature of the underlying disease process?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the disease potentially life or organ threatening?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What is known about long-term survival?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do relapses frequently occur in the specific disorder?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the data on different therapeutic regimens?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has the regimen improved survival?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What is the likelihood of inducing remission?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What is the relapse rate?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What are the known toxicities?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What accommodations should be made for unique characteristics of individual patients?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is there a history of medication toxicity or intolerability?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is there a contraindication to certain medications?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Does the presence of previous organ damage restrict therapeutic options?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Does the patient's age or gender constrain options?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do family preferences, tolerance of risk, or ability to comply with medication regimens strongly weigh for or against certain approaches?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of vasculitis depends upon the nature and severity of the disorder. Treatment options may include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or immunosuppressive agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a>, biologic response modifiers). While there are recommended, standardized protocols for initiating treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic vasculitis in adult patients, such protocols are seldom validated in pediatric patients. Accordingly, such protocols should be used as a suggested approach rather than firm guidelines for children and adolescents with vasculitides.</p><p>An overview of the general principles of the management of vasculitis is presented here. Specific recommendations, including dosing regimens and detailed discussions of the individual disorders, are presented separately. (See appropriate topic reviews for each specific type of vasculitis.)</p><p>As discussed above, the treatment of primary vasculitic syndromes will vary based upon the following factors (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles of management'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific types of vasculitis categorized by the location and size of the involved vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In particular, it is critical to distinguish primary from secondary vasculitis. In the latter case, therapy often is directed at treating the underlying disease (eg, infection or other rheumatic disorders). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Differentiating primary vasculitis from other disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized (eg, cutaneous) versus systemic involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute self-limited (eg, immunoglobulin A [IgA] vasculitis and Kawasaki disease) versus chronic-relapsing systemic disorders (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and microscopic polyangiitis).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management consists mainly of supportive measures when vascular inflammation is limited to the skin (such as mild cases of IgA vasculitis or isolated cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with mild hypersensitivity vasculitis due to a drug reaction, discontinuation of the offending drug may be adequate. Other supportive measures include antihistamines, which may relieve the itching associated with urticaria, and NSAIDs, which may provide analgesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypersensitivity vasculitis in children&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>In cases of cutaneous vasculitis where the course is more prolonged or chronic, such as cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">colchicine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dapsone</a> may be added to supportive measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622893362\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis refers to a broad spectrum of diseases that result in inflammation and destruction of the blood vessels of the brain, spinal cord, and meninges.

Management is based upon understanding the well-characterized course of these diseases, the risk of long-term sequelae, and the effectiveness of available therapy as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>IgA vasculitis </strong>&ndash; Since IgA vasculitis is usually self-limited, without major long-term complications, the management of affected patients is primarily supportive, with therapy focused on symptomatic relief of arthritis and abdominal pain while systematically monitoring for renal involvement. Glucocorticoids appear to ameliorate joint and gastrointestinal symptoms in children with IgA vasculitis who do not respond to supportive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but they do not seem to alter renal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Case reports and small case series, however, suggest that more potent agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] may be able to halt progressive renal involvement.

However, cardiac complications (particularly coronary artery aneurysms) may develop and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. As a result, patients with Kawasaki disease are treated during the acute phase of the disorder to reduce the risk of coronary aneurysms. In randomized clinical trials, the administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>, dramatically reduced the risk of coronary aneurysms in children with Kawasaki disease. For children who fail to respond to the initial standard therapy of IVIG and aspirin, other immunosuppressive agents may be used. The initial treatment of Kawasaki disease, refractory therapy, and cardiovascular complications of Kawasaki disease are discussed in detail separately.

Children with primary chronic systemic vasculitis should be cared for by experienced clinicians (eg, pediatric rheumatologists) who are familiar with the different primary vasculitides and their treatment. Management should always be based upon the best available evidence published in the literature while taking into consideration factors specific to individual patients such as disease activity, severity, and tolerance of medications. Glucocorticoids, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> for more severe disease, have been the standard of care for many types of primary chronic vasculitides. Other immunosuppressive drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azathioprine</a>, as well as biologic agents (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tocilizumab</a>), have shown benefit in small studies of various pediatric systemic vasculitides and are increasingly being used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155302017\"><span class=\"h4\">Induction and maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid therapy alone may be sufficient initial therapy for mild and limited disease, but an additional immunosuppressive agent is generally indicated for life- or organ-threatening involvement (eg, kidney, lung, or brain disease). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cyclophosphamide</a> is usually the first choice for an additional immunosuppressant agent to induce remission in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAVs) such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, based upon improved remission rates and survival in trials of adults with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, there is a shifting preference towards use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> rather than cyclophosphamide for induction therapy in children with AAV in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The dose of these medications is modified based upon the type and severity of the disease, rate of disease progression, and short- and long-term side effects of the therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Strategies to reduce cyclophosphamide burden, or alternatives to cyclophosphamide, have been increasingly adopted in adult and pediatric practice, although direct, pediatric-specific evidence for these strategies is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

While this approach was highly effective at inducing and maintaining remission, there was significant cyclophosphamide-related toxicity including bone marrow suppression, hemorrhagic cystitis, and increased infection risk, with reduced fertility and increased malignancy risk in the long term. Thus, studies in adult systemic vasculitis have focused on establishing treatment protocols based on disease severity in an effort to minimize treatment-related toxicity and maximize disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Rituximab</a>, a monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, has been shown to be as safe and effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> for inducing remission in adults with AAV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In other cases, end-organ damage is irreversible, resulting in permanent clinical abnormalities. For example, patients in remission may continue to have seizures or learning disabilities due to residual brain damage or hypertension due to renal damage, both of which were incurred during the period of active vasculitis. These and other chronic complications need to be addressed and treated accordingly with both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies.</p><p>The impact of these chronic disorders and their treatments upon the physical, educational, and psychosocial development of a growing child or adolescent should not be underestimated. It represents an additional arena of morbidity compared with adults with vasculitis. Important areas of potential concern include reduced physical fitness, excessive or inadequate weight gain, delayed puberty, reduced growth, impaired academic performance and career potential, limited participation in extracurricular activities, and depression.</p><p>In addition to the pharmaceutical management of immunosuppression by the clinician, children with severe systemic vasculitis are best cared for by a multidisciplinary team. Other medical subspecialists and health care professionals including nurses, physical and occupational therapists, social workers, and psychologists are team members who provide clinical care, counseling, referral to community services, and communication with the primary care clinician and school.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of initial therapy is to induce remission of the disease. Once this has been accomplished, a balance must be achieved between maintaining remission and minimizing treatment-related toxicities. In order to do this, patients must be monitored on a regular basis for signs of disease activity as well as medication side effects. It is important to remember that most forms of primary systemic vasculitis (except for immunoglobulin A [IgA] vasculitis and Kawasaki disease) tend to be chronic and relapsing. Distinguishing among active disease, chronic sequelae of disease, and treatment-related side effects can be challenging. Therefore, thorough and regular follow-up evaluations are necessary, even when the patient appears entirely well.</p><p>Patient monitoring relies upon some, but not all, of the procedures used in diagnosis including clinical findings, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and tissue biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending upon the organ predilection of a patient's vasculitis, certain symptoms and signs may provide reliable evidence of active disease, and, therefore, they are included in routine monitoring. Worsening uremia or deteriorating pulmonary function tests often herald a relapse of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, seizures or behavioral changes may auger reactivation of childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system (cPACNS), and bruits and new sites of claudication may result from progressive Takayasu arteritis. Such features are not always attributable to vascular inflammation, and other signs and symptoms, such as headaches, fatigue, and worsening hypertension, are less clearly attributable to active disease alone rather than medication side effects or depression. In addition, vessel damage may progress in some types of vasculitis despite a complete lack of symptoms and entirely normal acute-phase reactants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In these settings, monitoring disease activity with the aid of laboratory tests, repeat imaging studies, or formal cognitive or pulmonary function testing is often essential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following laboratory tests are used to monitor disease activity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute-phase reactants</strong> &ndash; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and platelet count, among others, are nonspecific markers of inflammation. Elevations of these tests may be indicative of increased disease activity. Acute changes in conjunction with other clinical findings, or persistent abnormalities not accounted for by intercurrent illnesses or other factors, must be investigated carefully.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urinalysis</strong> &ndash; Monitoring with urinalyses on a regular basis can detect changes in the urinary sediment that may reflect active disease in vasculitides that typically target the kidneys. Changes in the urinary sediment may also be due to persistent renal damage from earlier active disease or medication toxicity, such as hematuria from cyclophosphamide-associated hemorrhagic cystitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers</strong> &ndash; The utility of ANCA titers to predict active disease or risk of flares in ANCA-positive vasculitides remains controversial and is an area of ongoing study. Total ANCA levels do not seem to correlate with disease activity, but specific subgroups of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies may more closely reflect active vasculitis. Based upon available data, ANCA titers should not be used in isolation when making treatment decisions. This question is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;, section on 'Does a rise in ANCA titers predict a disease flare?'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Von Willebrand factor (VWF)</strong> &ndash; VWF, and perhaps other markers of endothelial cell disruption, may be useful for following damage to small vessels, as occurs in vasculitis. In certain cases, such proteins may provide a more specific marker of disease activity than other acute-phase reactants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p/><p>Laboratory tests are also ordered for the purpose of monitoring medication toxicity, such as reduced cell counts in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, or elevated transaminases in those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies of vessels or of major organs, such as the brain or lungs, may be necessary to distinguish whether clinical symptoms reflect active disease or prior damage. These studies, which include ultrasonography, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be used at regular intervals, even in the absence of symptoms, in order to monitor disease progression and response to treatment. As previously discussed, many laboratory markers are nonspecific <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may not reliably correlate with disease activity. Thus, it is often necessary to use imaging as part of follow-up evaluations. Other types of studies evaluating end-organ function, such as pulmonary function tests, may also be helpful.</p><p>Although conventional angiography may be necessary in the initial diagnostic evaluation of some systemic vasculitides, less invasive modalities, such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, are preferred for continued routine monitoring, reserving more invasive testing for those situations in which more accurate imaging is required for critical therapeutic decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient had an initial biopsy and the findings were diagnostic, often little more is to be learned by repeating the procedure as part of ongoing monitoring. On the other hand, if the patient's original diagnosis is in question, a new illness is suspected, or ongoing disease activity must be distinguished from manifestations of irreversible damage, repeat biopsies may be useful. This is particularly likely to be the case with kidney involvement, although involvement of other organs also must be assessed in this way on occasion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease-activity scoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formalized scoring tools, such as the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS), that are used to determine disease activity at the time of diagnosis are increasingly used to monitor disease activity and response to therapy. Fluctuations in scores are used to adjust medication dosing or choice of therapy for adults with vasculitis, both in the investigational and clinical practice setting. These tools are sometimes used for children with or without some pediatric-specific adaptations, although most of these tools have not been validated for use in pediatrics. As an example, the Pediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS), an adaptation of the BVAS, was internally validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although external validation of this tool on an independent dataset would be valuable, it has already been used as a standard measure of disease in one pediatric vasculitis clinical trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes are dependent upon numerous factors including the specific diagnosis, disease severity, involvement of major organs, response to treatment, and damage caused by treatment.</p><p>The majority of children with primary vasculitis have a good outcome because the two most common disorders, Kawasaki disease and immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, are usually self-limited, and only a small minority of children have long-term sequelae from either damage or ongoing disease activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Management&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>For the other primary systemic vasculitides, immunosuppressive therapy has improved survival and remission rates. As an example, prior to the introduction of the regimen of high-dose glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a>, granulomatosis with polyangiitis was fatal in almost all reported pediatric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and adult cases. The reported median survival time was five months in untreated adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The combination of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide or other remittive agents has greatly improved patient outcomes. Similar therapeutic strategies have proven beneficial in the treatment of other systemic vasculitides.

Unfortunately, more than half of the cohort had evidence of damage at 12 months despite high improvement rates and aggressive treatment. No patients in the cohort died during the 12-month follow-up period.</p><p>Despite improved remission and survival rates, relapse is still common, especially when therapy is weaned or stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Flares of granulomatosis with polyangiitis occur in up to 83 percent of pediatric patients as treatment is weaned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57</a>]. A high rate of relapse (approximately 75 percent) is also seen in patients with polyarteritis nodosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Lower relapse rates are seen in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis (50 and 33 percent, respectively). As a result, maintenance immunosuppression is commonly used in these disorders.

Measurement tools, such as the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI), are widely used in adult chronic vasculitis to formally quantify damage due to either disease or treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-management-overview/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy and may be sufficient as monotherapy in patients with mild or limited disease. However, in patients with severe or life-threatening disease, additional immunosuppressive agents or biologic response modifiers are generally needed. For refractory or frequently relapsing disease following standard induction therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> is an option in children with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tocilizumab</a> are options in children with Takayasu disease.
