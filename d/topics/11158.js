CMA is even more prevalent in infants. Two studies published in the 1990s reported a CMA prevalence of 2.2 and 2.8 percent at one year of age in general population birth cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], consistent with the rate found in another cohort of over 6000 newborns followed for 18 to 34 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, a lower rate of 0.6 percent in three-year-old children was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of CMA in adults is not as well reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of CMA by patient report in a multinational survey of 17,280 adults (aged 20 to 44 years) from 15 countries that questioned participants about foods that &quot;nearly always&quot; caused &quot;illness&quot; or &quot;trouble&quot; was 4.3 percent. However, a much lower proportion of adults have confirmed CMA, ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,11,12</a>]. Allergy persists from childhood in a subgroup of adults with CMA, but two reports suggest that the majority of adults with CMA acquired the allergy in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In two small series, over 80 percent of adults with CMA were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In contrast, childhood CMA is more prevalent in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cow's milk is the third most common food, after peanut and tree nuts, responsible for food-induced anaphylaxis in pediatric and mixed-age populations (10 to 19 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Milk is also the third most common food responsible for fatal or near-fatal food-induced anaphylactic reactions (8 to 15 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. CMA was reported in approximately 40 percent of patients seen in a university-based pediatric allergy outpatient clinic focusing on food allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thirty-seven percent of children with atopic dermatitis referred to a university-based dermatology clinic had clinically significant immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food hypersensitivity; of them, 17 percent had CMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fatal-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fatal anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute allergic responses to milk are due to immunoglobulin E (IgE) directed against various allergens in milk. All milk proteins are potential allergens, and polysensitization to several proteins occurs in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Cow's milk contains casein (alphaS1-, alphaS2-, beta-, and kappa-caseins) and whey (alpha-lactalbumin [ALA], beta-lactoglobulin [BLG], bovine lactoferrin, bovine serum albumin [BSA], and bovine immunoglobulins) proteins that account for approximately 80 and 20 percent of total protein, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most patients with cow's milk allergy (CMA) are sensitized to several milk proteins, including BLG, casein, ALA, BSA, bovine lactoferrin, and bovine immunoglobulins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Casein, BLG, and ALA are the major milk allergens, and cosensitization to these three allergens is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, sensitization to milk proteins present in very low concentrations, such as bovine lactoferrin, BSA, and bovine immunoglobulins, is also seen in up to half of patients with CMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,27</a>]. Some patients are sensitized exclusively to these minor allergens. As an example, sensitization to BSA is independent of sensitization to the other milk allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The clinical relevance of sensitization to different milk proteins is largely unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cooking diminishes the allergenicity of whey proteins, particularly BLG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], presumably by denaturation of heat-labile proteins that results in loss of conformational epitopes. This may explain why extensively heated milk (eg, milk in baked goods) is better tolerated by many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Similarly, yogurt cultures, which ferment and acidify milk, diminish the amount of intact whey protein in milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and may result in tolerance of yogurt-based dairy products by individuals with CMA exclusively sensitized to whey proteins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-features-of-food-allergens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular features of food allergens&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of non-IgE-mediated milk allergy and milk allergy due to mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated processes is less well understood.

Patients with this disorder have symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) but are unresponsive to conventional reflux therapies. Other presenting symptoms include feeding disorders, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysphagia, and food impaction. Patients with allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis (eosinophilic gastroenteropathy of the stomach and intestines) may have symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss. The role of food allergy in eosinophilic gastroenteritis is less clear than in eosinophilic esophagitis.

It can present in one of two ways. The typical presentation is that of severe vomiting and diarrhea within two to four hours after ingestion of the offending allergen, causing profound dehydration, lethargy, and sometimes shock. The acute phase can be the first manifestation of FPIES or can occur when the allergen is removed from the diet and then reintroduced. Chronic exposure to the offending allergen may present with more subtle symptoms, such as regurgitation, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypoalbuminemia. Cow's milk is among the major offending allergens. FPIES in children is presented in greater detail separately.

The majority of affected infants have failure to thrive, and some present with malabsorption. It may be difficult to distinguish FPE from postenteritis syndrome, especially because FPE can develop after infectious gastroenteritis leading to secondary lactose intolerance. This presentation has become much less common due to the common practice of switching to a hypoallergenic formula shortly after symptoms develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3574531622\"><span class=\"h3\">Heiner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heiner syndrome (food-induced pulmonary hemosiderosis) is a pulmonary disease that is caused by food hypersensitivity, primarily to cow's milk.

Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated CMA tends to resolve more quickly than IgE-mediated CMA. An early report indicated that most children with IgE-mediated CMA become tolerant by three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, a subsequent study suggested that IgE-mediated CMA is more persistent, with children outgrowing this allergy in later childhood and adolescence (64 percent by 12 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

A summary of this information, with a focus on those aspects that are most relevant to the diagnosis of cow's milk allergy (CMA), is provided below.

The gold standard for diagnosis is a clinician-supervised, double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge, although an open challenge will often suffice. Measurement of cow's milk-specific IgE can aid in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated CMA and may eliminate the need for oral food challenges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of in vitro immunoassays for specific IgE (which are still commonly referred to as IgE radioallergosorbent tests [RAST]), other diagnostic allergy procedures, including skin testing and food challenges, should be performed by allergy specialists with training in the management of serious allergic reactions.

Skin prick tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in vitro tests for IgE are usually performed initially.

However, the predictive values for clinical reactivity associated with food-specific IgE levels determined by the ImmunoCAP assay should not be applied to results from other assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) allows identification of IgE binding to specific proteins, which may be informative to distinguish between different phenotypes of milk allergy. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of IgE testing to individual proteins for these foods.

In breastfed infants, the dietary elimination includes a maternal exclusion diet avoiding cow's milk protein and, in formula-fed infants, use of either extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based infant formulae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63667 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. If minimal to no improvement is noted on a milk-avoidance diet and no significant differences are noted with reintroduction (or challenge is negative), the food in question is not responsible for symptoms, the diet has not been restricted enough, or the patient may have multiple food allergies and additional foods may be considered suspicious.

Milk is a less common allergen in adults, affecting approximately 0.2 percent of the adult population. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tolerance is achieved by the majority of children with CMA. Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated CMA tends to resolve by early childhood, whereas IgE-mediated CMA may persist into adolescence and beyond.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of IgE-mediated milk allergy is based upon careful history supported by skin prick tests and in vitro tests for specific IgE. An oral food challenge is warranted if the diagnosis of milk allergy is uncertain. Diagnostic testing for non-IgE-mediated manifestations is limited.
