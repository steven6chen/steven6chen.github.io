Most patients with MPGN and a monoclonal gammopathy have no identifiable disease; this disorder has been called MPGN associated with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS). In a report from the Mayo Clinic of 68 patients with MPGN who were not infected with hepatitis C virus, 28 (41 percent) had a monoclonal gammopathy on serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine electrophoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

We suggest measuring C3, C4, CH50 (which provides a measure of activation of the classic complement pathway), and AH50 (which provides a measure of activation of the alternative complement pathway). Low or absent levels should lead to genetic analysis for mutations and allele variants of complement factors and to assays for autoantibodies to complement regulating proteins (eg, factors H and I), including testing for C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) and, if available, serum levels of the membrane attack complex. Factor H and other measurements, including C3 activation and breakdown products, C3NeF, and mutation screening of a variety of complement related genes including factor H are available in select research laboratories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110840\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110840 \">table 1</a>).

In addition, among patients with MPGN and MGUS, some patients progress to a malignancy such as multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The optimal therapy of MPGN in patients with a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is uncertain. We suggest treating patients with a non-IgM MGUS with a regimen used to treat multiple myeloma. In patients with an IgM MGUS, we suggest a regimen used to treat Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

Poor prognostic signs at presentation include the nephrotic syndrome, an elevated serum creatinine, hypertension (or blood pressure well above the patient's previous baseline), and, on renal biopsy, crescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. By contrast, patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria and normal blood pressure appear to have an excellent long-term renal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. Greater degrees of hematuria (eg, 50 or more versus 5 to 20 red blood cells per high power field) suggest more inflammation but there is no evidence of an independent effect on prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H267197965\" class=\"local\">'Suggested regimens according to presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Another important adverse prognostic sign on renal biopsy is tubulointerstitial disease (interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and tubular atrophy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The risk of progression usually correlates more closely with the severity of the tubulointerstitial injury than with the degree of glomerular damage. This finding is typical of most glomerular diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Tubulointerstitial fibrosis'</a>.) </p><p>Older reports suggested a relatively poor renal prognosis in patients with apparently idiopathic MPGN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/21-23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23,25,26</a>]. However, such reports should be interpreted with caution since they were compiled before our knowledge of the many treatable disorders that can underlie MPGN. These include hepatitis C virus infection, monoclonal gammopathies, and complement cascade abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The net effect is that a possible underlying etiology is likely to be found in the majority of cases of MPGN; idiopathic disease is now uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H858669072\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of the glomerulonephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of secondary MPGN is directed at treatment of the underlying condition since the renal disease often resolves with treatment of causes such as infection, autoimmune disorders, and monoclonal gammopathy. </p><p>Once treatable underlying causes of MPGN have been excluded, three conditions remain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic immune complex-mediated MPGN</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C3 glomerulonephritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dense deposit disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284123153\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic immune complex-mediated MPGN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of idiopathic immune complex-mediated MPGN has not been well defined. The best data come from a series of 126 patients, 93 of whom were evaluated for hepatitis C and B virus and a dysproteinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Treatment is generally determined by the severity of kidney dysfunction. Patients who have a normal estimated GFR and non-nephrotic range proteinuria may be treated conservatively with angiotensin inhibitors alone in order to control blood pressure and reduce proteinuria, since the long-term outcome is relatively benign in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. These patients should be seen at three and six months to detect possible disease progression (eg, increases in serum creatinine or proteinuria as estimated from the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio) due to continuing immune injury. If there is no disease progression at six months, subsequent visits are at six month intervals if the patient remains asymptomatic.

In addition, early studies were performed before angiotensin inhibitors were commonly used, and the diagnosis of idiopathic MPGN was made before investigators were as aware of such causes as hepatitis C virus infection, monoclonal gammopathies, and complement pathway abnormalities that underlie MPGN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, disease progression can occur. As a result, regular monitoring of the serum creatinine, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and the urinalysis is warranted. Although supportive data are not available, patients with more hematuria (eg, 50 or more versus 5 to 20 red blood cells per high power field) may be at greater risk for progressive disease. We suggest that patients with more hematuria be monitored more frequently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrotic syndrome, normal or near-normal creatinine &ndash; We suggest a treatment regimen similar to that used in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose 60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for 12 to 16 weeks.

The benefit of prednisone was partially offset by its toxicity, particularly hypertension which led to cessation of therapy in five patients treated with prednisone (three developed hypertensive encephalopathy) compared with two patients treated with lactose (both developed hypertensive encephalopathy). Because more patients were treated with prednisone than lactose (47 versus 33), the frequency of cessation of therapy for hypertension was similar in both groups (6.4 versus 6.1 percent), which reflects the importance of hypertension in the natural history of the disease. </p><p>There are a number of problems that limit the interpretation of this trial for current therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patients were enrolled between 1970 and 1980, before patients with MPGN were routinely evaluated for hepatitis C and B or abnormalities in the complement cascade.

The treatment of MPGN depends upon the underlying cause since most patients have either a circulating immune complex disease or dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune complex-mediated MPGN is characterized by positive staining for immunoglobulin and complement on immunofluorescence microscopy. Patients who have such findings should be evaluated for infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathy and, when relevant, appropriate therapy of the underlying disease should be initiated. (See <a href=\"#H1655349110\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement-mediated MPGN is characterized by positive staining for C3 (or, rarely, C4d) and no or minimal staining for immunoglobulin by immunofluorescence microscopy. Patients with C3 glomerulopathy should undergo an evaluation for activation of the alternative pathway of complement. (See <a href=\"#H1655349110\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with other glomerular diseases, patients who present with non-nephrotic proteinuria (less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> no hypoalbuminemia, and no edema), normal serum creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate, and normal blood pressure have a benign prognosis as long as the renal manifestations do not become more prominent. Poor prognostic signs at presentation include the nephrotic syndrome, an elevated serum creatinine or a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, and, on renal biopsy, crescents. (See <a href=\"#H56342453\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of renal prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once underlying causes have been excluded, the treatment of idiopathic immune complex-mediated MPGN is determined by the severity of kidney dysfunction. There are limited data to guide therapy. Our approach, which is based upon clinical experience, is as follows (see <a href=\"#H267197965\" class=\"local\">'Suggested regimens according to presentation'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with non-nephrotic proteinuria (less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> no hypoalbuminemia, and no edema), normal serum creatinine, and normal blood pressure (mild disease), we recommend conservative therapy with angiotensin inhibition alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Regular monitoring of the serum creatinine, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and the urinalysis is warranted in such patients to permit detection of disease progression. Although supportive data are not available, patients with more hematuria (eg, 50 or more versus 5 to 20 red blood cells per high power field) may be at greater risk for progressive disease. We suggest that patients with more hematuria be monitored more frequently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with nephrotic syndrome and a normal or near-normal creatinine, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in addition to angiotensin inhibition therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Prednisone may be given at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose 60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for 12 to 16 weeks. If the patient responds, prednisone should be tapered to alternate-day therapy over six to eight months. If there is less than a 30 percent reduction in proteinuria after 12 to 16 weeks, we suggest tapering and discontinuation of prednisone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Calcineurin inhibitors may be considered in patients who do not respond to or tolerate glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with an elevated serum creatinine, with or without nephrotic syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension, and without crescents, we suggest initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Prednisone may be given at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose 60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. If there is no response or there are increases in the serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria, we suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically use 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, reduced to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in patients with a serum creatinine greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or age greater than 60 years for three to six months. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> may be used in patients who do not respond to cyclophosphamide. (See <a href=\"#H267200721\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with rapidly progressive disease with or without crescents, we recommend that patients be treated with glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
