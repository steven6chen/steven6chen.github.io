In one study, in which 9106 newborns were prospectively screened for clavicle fractures, the prevalence was 1 in 213 live births (0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. All fractures occurred during vaginal deliveries, and none of the infants were in breech presentation. Risk factors for newborn clavicle fractures included large birth weight (average birth weight 3.8 versus 3.4 kg among infants with and without clavicle fractures, respectively), shoulder dystocia, mechanically assisted delivery, and prolonged gestation. In these infants, fracture callus usually is visible or palpable within the first two weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

However, it is very uncommon among children evaluated for abuse. As an example, in a prospective observational study of 2890 children undergoing evaluation for physical abuse, 19 children had metabolic bone disease including vitamin D deficiency (rickets), osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism, and Menkes syndrome (0.01 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Similarly to victims of child abuse, children with metabolic bone disease may have periosteal new bone formation or sustain pathologic fractures after seemingly trivial trauma. In contrast to the degree of trauma in children with inflicted injuries, trauma in children with metabolic bone disease actually is trivial. Metabolic bone disease can usually be distinguished from inflicted injury after a complete examination and appropriate laboratory and radiographic studies. Assessment of vitamin D or copper status is not routinely indicated, unless clinical evaluation or radiographs reveal signs of metabolic bone disease such as a frail, premature infant, osteopenia, or extreme dietary practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p>Of note, the presence of metabolic bone disease does not exclude the possibility of concurrent child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Rickets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metaphyseal&nbsp;lucencies and periosteal new bone formation may be seen in rickets, but the characteristic radiographic and laboratory findings of rickets can usually distinguish this disease from physical abuse as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiographic findings</strong> &ndash; The characteristic radiographic findings of rickets include osteopenia, metaphyseal cupping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F80989\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80989 \">image 1</a>), physeal widening, enlargement of the costochondral junction (&quot;rachitic rosary&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81446\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81446 \">image 2</a>)), and Looser zones (pseudofractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52768\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52768 \">image 3</a>)). By contrast, in a series of 46 infant fatalities due to child abuse with metaphyseal corner fractures, none had radiologic or pathologic findings of rickets, indicating that rickets is not associated with these types of fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Other biochemical findings vary depending upon the type of rickets, and may include decreased calcium or phosphate concentrations.

Premature infants, particularly those with birth weights less than 1500 g, and breast-fed or infants with inadequate intake of vitamin D are at risk for rickets.

Radiographic findings include large periosteal calcium deposits secondary to subperiosteal hemorrhage and central epiphyseal lucency. Infants and children with ascorbic acid deficiency typically present with irritability, pseudoparalysis (secondary to pain), failure to thrive, and gingival hemorrhage. The prominence of hair follicles on the thighs and buttocks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64172\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64172 \">picture 1</a>) and the eruption of coiled, fragmented hair with a characteristic corkscrew appearance are specific features of vitamin C deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Copper deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Copper deficiency may be caused by dietary deficiency or a recessive X-linked disorder of copper metabolism (Menkes disease, kinky hair disease).

In addition, children with copper deficiency usually have delayed bone age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and symmetric skeletal findings involving the entire skeleton. The skeletal changes are particularly evident in the most rapidly growing bone ends (eg, the wrists, knees, proximal femora and humeri, and costochondral junctions).</p><p>If the copper deficiency is severe enough to cause fractures, the other clinical manifestations (as described above) should be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Nutritional copper deficiency is neither associated with skull fracture or cerebral hemorrhage, nor with rib fractures in full-term infants. Furthermore, nutritional copper deficiency is unlikely if the child lacks a predisposing factor and has normal-appearing bones on skeletal survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Some of these are associated with renal disease (eg, primary hyperoxaluria, autosomal dominant distal renal tubular acidosis, Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome). Others are associated with skeletal abnormalities (eg, McCune-Albright syndrome, mucolipidosis II [I-cell disease], Gaucher disease, hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome [Job syndrome]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Because these fractures may occur with unrecognized or minor trauma, and because the children are seen as particularly vulnerable to abuse, concerns for abuse sometimes develops. Ambulatory children with milder forms of such disorders are not at increased risk of abuse, and may be safely evaluated consistent with practice in healthy children. Non-ambulatory children are at elevated risk due to immobilization and subsequent osteopenia. These children frequently have feeding difficulties limiting calcium intake and absorption that may also contribute to their reduced bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SKELETAL DYSPLASIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteogenesis imperfecta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder of collagen formation that results in &quot;brittle&quot; bones that are prone to repeated fracture, often with minimal trauma. Because OI is described as causing vulnerability to bruises, subdural hemorrhage and retinal hemorrhage as well, it is the prototype for diseases that may be confused with child abuse. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of OI are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar to children with inflicted trauma, children with severe forms of OI often have multiple fractures in various stages of healing. They also may have metaphyseal, rib, and skull fractures. Although OI is a well-recognized cause of fractures that occur with minimal or no witnessed trauma, OI is a rare disorder and consequently is seldom the underlying cause in such cases. This was illustrated in a study of 39 infants (up to 12 months of age) who had rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Final diagnoses were child abuse (82 percent), accidental injuries (8 percent), birth trauma (one case), and, finally, bone fragility (8 percent, of whom one had OI, one had rickets, and one was born prematurely). In addition, in a prospective study of 2890 children undergoing evaluation for abuse, only four were subsequently found to have OI (0.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The differentiation between OI and child abuse can be difficult, and relies heavily on careful clinical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-defects-of-the-teeth#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental defects of the teeth&quot;, section on 'Dentinogenesis imperfecta'</a>.)</p><p>However, the characteristic features of OI are not universally present, and when this is so, the differentiation from child abuse may be difficult. To further complicate the issue, children with OI are not immune to inflicted trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Severe OI can present as multiple fractures in the perinatal or neonatal period.</p><p>Retinal hemorrhages and subdural hematoma, which are red flags for child abuse also can occur in children with OI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. </p><p>There is no definitive lab test for OI. As in child abuse, the diagnosis of OI is largely clinical, and is based mainly on a careful history and physical examination. No single test can definitively exclude the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].&nbsp;Analysis of type I collagen genes (which requires skin biopsy for fibroblast culture) and DNA testing of white blood cells for mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 can be helpful. Abnormalities either in quantity or quality of type I collagen are present in about 90 percent of OI cases. DNA sequencing to test for mutations of the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes will detect mutations in patients with OI approximately 95 percent of the time, but false negative results do occur.&nbsp;Many different mutations of the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes have been documented, some of which are variations of unknown significance. In cases with high clinical concern for OI, skin biopsy and fibroblast culture for collagen analysis can provide complementary information, though the false negative rate for fibroblast culture is 15 percent.

Moreover, in a healthy growing child, bone density increases with age, whereas in a child with OI, bone density will decrease or remain the same as the child gets older. Thus, two DEXA scans, four to six months apart, are typically required to evaluate a child for possible OI. This requirement for a repeat DEXA scan poses an important limitation for the use of bone mineral density studies to differentiate child abuse from mild OI in the acute setting&nbsp;at the time the&nbsp;child presents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease, Caffey-Silverman disease) is characterized by fever (sometimes as high as 40&deg;C [104&ordm;F]), irritability, subperiosteal bone hyperplasia, and swelling of overlying soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse/abstract/56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-60</a>].
