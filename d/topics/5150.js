These may be located in the earlobe or the cartilaginous portions of the pinna (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57847 \">figure 1</a>). Local contact dermatitis to gold-plated or metal alloy studs, poor hygiene, and constant pressure caused by fixing clips create local swelling at the piercing site. Subsequently, skin ischemia, inflammation, and decubitus ulcer formation develop along with penetration of a portion or the entire earring into the pinna [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H903858\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embedded earrings are most common in girls under 10 years of age and young adolescents who are less likely to perform appropriate hygiene and more likely to frequently handle the earring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H903851\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embedded earrings are diagnosed based upon clinical features in patients who have recently undergone ear piercing.

In such cases, the earring may be palpable, especially when embedded in the earlobe. However, palpation of the external ear is often exquisitely painful. Alternatively, plain radiographs can confirm the diagnosis when the earring is not visible.</p><p>Piercing through the cartilage of the helix or fossa triangularis can lead to infection, perichondritis, and permanent disfigurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86319 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86320\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86320 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13832065\"><span class=\"h2\">Removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jewelry portions that have migrated into the subcutaneous tissues should be removed promptly to avoid infection.

Signs of perichondritis or chondritis in patients with an embedded earring are similar and include pain, swelling and erythema of the overlying skin. Consultation with an otolaryngologist is advised. Fluctuant swelling indicates an abscess that must be drained and is typically associated with chondritis; <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is the pathogen in up to 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Antibiotic options should cover <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and include oral fluoroquinolones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>) in adolescents and adults and parenteral antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>) in children.

Most of the canal is cartilaginous in young children. As the bony tympanic ring grows, the EAC becomes roughly one-third cartilaginous and two-thirds bony with a narrow isthmus separating the two zones. The cartilaginous portion is superficial and has thick lining skin, subcutaneous tissue and hair structures. The skin of the deeper bony part of the ear canal is thin, tightly attached to underlying periosteum and free of hair. Manipulation of foreign bodies in the deep, hairless portion of the ear canal can lead to pain and bleeding, while the superficial portion is less sensitive. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29168905\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most aural foreign bodies are found in children six years of age and younger with a smaller portion occurring in older children and special needs adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

Other lesions may rarely mimic foreign bodies of the ear canal as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A congenital cholesteatoma (abnormal accumulation of squamous epithelium within the middle ear and mastoid) may have the appearance of a round white foreign body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72870%7EPEDS%2F73085\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72870 graphicRef73085 \">picture 5A-B</a>). It typically is seen in the anterosuperior quadrant of the ear drum and is located within the middle ear.

The most common of these is acute otitis media. History of ear pain and fever and physical examination demonstrating a clear or whitish discharge from the ear strongly suggest acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation. Suction of the drainage and visualization using otoscopy or otomicroscopy may also be helpful. Evaluation and diagnosis of other causes of otorrhea are discussed separately.

Button batteries, live insects and penetrating foreign bodies warrant urgent removal for the following reasons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Button batteries</strong> &ndash; Button batteries are found in toys, hearing aids, and household electronics. Once in the EAC, they cause destruction because of strong electrical currents (rather than leakage of battery contents) and pressure necrosis. Maximum destruction typically occurs at the negative battery pole because electrolysis at that site generates hydroxide ions which cause alkaline tissue necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Damage to the ear canal skin, tympanic membrane, facial nerve, and ossicles have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Permanent hearing loss has also been described. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insects</strong> &ndash; A variety of insects may take up temporary residence in the EAC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86324\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86324 \">picture 6</a>). Cockroaches are most commonly found, especially among inner city children, as they prefer warm, dark environments. A live insect moving in a child&rsquo;s ear canal can cause considerable discomfort and occasionally may damage the tympanic membrane and middle ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Cotton applicators (Q-tips&reg;), pencil points (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86325\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86325 \">picture 7</a>), tree branches and hair pins are frequent culprits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Pain, vertigo, nystagmus, ataxia, otorrhea, facial nerve paralysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hearing loss are worrisome signs that warrant prompt consultation with an otolaryngologist. Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests help to identify hearing loss and can often differential a conductive loss (from tympanic membrane or ossicular disruption) from a sensory-neural loss (from damage to inner ear structures) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032 \">figure 3</a>).

These may be located in the earlobe or the cartilaginous portions of the pinna (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57847 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H903865\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with embedded earrings commonly present with ear pain, swelling, redness, and purulent drainage from the piercing site. On inspection, the earring clip behind the pinna is typically not seen while the post and decorative portion of the earring is often visible. In extreme cases, the entire earring may not be visualized. (See <a href=\"#H903851\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jewelry portions that have migrated into the subcutaneous tissues should be removed promptly to avoid infection. Analgesia for this procedure is typically accomplished by local infiltration or field block. In younger patients, procedural sedation may be needed. The technique for removal is described. (See <a href=\"#H13832065\" class=\"local\">'Removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perichondritis and chondritis may complicate pinna foreign bodies, especially for piercings through cartilage. When present, these infections warrant systemic antibiotics with activity against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and consultation with an otolaryngologist is advised. (See <a href=\"#H13832468\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign bodies of the external ear canal (EAC) frequently occur in children six years of age and younger and consist of a variety of objects including round beads, pebbles, tissue paper, small toys, and insects. (See <a href=\"#H29168905\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with foreign bodies of the EAC are frequently asymptomatic. Visualization of a foreign body in the EAC on otoscopy confirms the diagnosis. The other ear and both nostrils should also be examined closely for additional foreign bodies. In most patients, clinical findings are sufficient to identify a foreign body in the EAC and to exclude other diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H8360855\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8360863\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Button batteries in the EAC as well as penetrating foreign bodies or those associated with injury to the EAC, tympanic membrane, or middle ear should undergo urgent removal by an otolaryngologist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elective referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted for asymptomatic patients with EAC foreign bodies that are glass or sharp-edged, spherical and tightly wedged, or up against the tympanic membrane or when clinicians lack proper instrumentation or personnel to restrain or sedate an uncooperative patient.
