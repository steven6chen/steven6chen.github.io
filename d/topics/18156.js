We prefer high sensitivity troponin assays, when available. A high sensitivity troponin assay was first approved for use in the United States in 2017. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-analytical-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Analytical considerations&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The analytical performance metrics for these assays can be found on the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3700263609\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as a clinical event consequent to the death of cardiac myocytes (myocardial necrosis) that is caused by ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Acute MI'</a>.). </p><p>The diagnosis of acute MI requires both evidence of acute myocardial injury (myocyte death) and clinical evidence of ischemia (eg, chest pain or an abnormal electrocardiogram). Troponin is the preferred serologic test in the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of acute MI, and an elevated value is required in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin#H516921343\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biomarkers of cardiac injury other than troponin&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Individuals suspected of acute MI often present to an emergency department with chest pain as their primary complaint. However, some patients do not have classic symptoms or signs, such as those with diabetes, the elderly, and those who are postoperative. Many of these patients may have electrocardiographic findings suggesting myocardial ischemia or infarction, but the electrocardiogram is a relatively insensitive diagnostic tool. </p><p>Acute myocardial injury is defined biochemically as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A troponin must be above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) for the normal range of the assay being used. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fall of the troponin value should be observed. Cardiac troponin concentrations usually begin to rise two to three hours after the onset of acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] but this may vary with other causes for acute myocardial injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who present late after the onset of acute myocardial injury, including those with acute MI, may be on the downslope of the time-concentration curve and thus it may be difficult to appreciate a changing pattern over a short period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p>The broad, clinical discussion of the integration of troponin testing into the evaluation of patients with possible acute MI is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Cardiac biomarkers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1492456570\"><span class=\"h2\">Caveats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate and timely diagnosis of acute (thrombotic) MI is important, as effective management includes specific antithrombotic medications and possible percutaneous coronary intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, some patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for acute MI based on the finding of an elevated troponin do not have acute coronary artery obstruction (usually a thrombotic event) as the immediate cause. To the extent possible, identifying these patients is important since their management potentially differs from those with an acute thrombotic event.</p><p>There are at least three potential reasons why a patient with clinically suspected acute (thrombotic) MI may be misdiagnosed: test-related issues, myocardial injury not related to coronary artery atherothrombosis, and acute myocardial injury not related to the coronary circulation. These three issues are discussed directly below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3934918468\"><span class=\"h3\">Test-related issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As is true for most other diagnostic tests, the positive and negative predictive values of a given troponin test result are influenced by the prevalence of the disease in the population in which the test is being used.</p><p>Several protocols to include or exclude (&quot;rule out&quot;) the diagnosis of acute MI have been suggested for the screening of patients in an emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a>). Since an elevated troponin is essential for the diagnosis of acute MI, two normal troponins (if appropriately timed) can, in theory, exclude MI in most cases, assuming the criteria are sufficiently robust. However, many of these protocols rule in acute myocardial injury based on an elevated high sensitivity troponin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a significant change in values. However, acute myocardial injury is not synonymous with a diagnosis of acute MI.&nbsp;These approaches developed in chest pain patients have a specificity in populations presenting with chest discomfort of between 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3318055716\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). These protocols should not be applied to an all-comers population that might include patients with end stage renal disease, many more elderly patients, and many more critically ill patients. Thus, if these cut-offs are used in the emergency department, it should be clear they cannot be used in all patients and likely will not be applicable for use in the hospital in general. Other approaches in an all-comers populations have been suggested but have not been validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].&nbsp; </p><p>For most high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile URL values are higher in men than in women. In some studies, this has made a difference in diagnostic efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in some studies, it has not shown benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and in some even reduction in sensitivity for the detection of acute MI in men. We agree with the recommendation for sex-specific cut-off values in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Europe has not adopted this recommendation. </p><p>It should be appreciated that there will be a significant increase in the number of elevated results seen with hs-cTn assays that reflect conditions other than those related to acute atherothrombotic coronary artery disease. There will be more events detected in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and more events in those with minimal coronary disease and without overt culprit lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>]; such patients presumably require different therapies than those with acute atherothrombotic MI. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4231011696\"><span class=\"h3\">Type I versus type II MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who are found to meet criteria for acute MI (see <a href=\"#H3700263609\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of acute MI'</a> above) will have obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery stenoses with acute thrombosis as the underlying pathology. However, some patients (up to 28 percent in one series) will not have significant epicardial coronary artery disease when coronary angiography is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Many of these patients are defined as having a Type 2 MI, which is defined as an MI consequent to increased oxygen demand or decreased supply (eg, coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery spasm, coronary artery embolus, <span class=\"nowrap\">tachy-/bradyarrhythmias,</span> anemia, respiratory failure, hypertension, or hypotension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Acute MI'</a>.)</p><p>With the use of previous non-high sensitivity assays, patients with acute ischemia and an elevated troponin value benefited from diagnostic coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention. This is not nearly as clear with hs-cTn assays since the increased sensitivity of these assays means that larger numbers of patients with type 2 acute MI will be detected; these patients may not benefit from an invasive approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>It may be useful for clinicians to be aware of how the values with prior standard assays compare with high sensitivity ones. Since the advocacy for an invasive strategy was based on elevations of the standard assays, results above the value with the hs-cTn assay that comport to the prior value may be helpful to clinician. These values have been termed &quot;anchor values&quot; by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For example, a value of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> with the fifth generation hs-cTnT assay comports to a value of 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> with the fourth generation assay and a value of 52 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> to a value of 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. For some hs-cTnI assays, the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile URLs will remain the same. For others, the appropriate conversions will need to be developed. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3318055716\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, in patients with chest pain or equivalent symptoms, an electrocardiogram suggestive of myocardial ischemia, and an elevated troponin, particularly when markedly elevated, the most likely diagnosis is acute (thrombotic) MI, with obstructive coronary artery disease being the most likely pathologic basis. Other patients will have a supply-demand mismatch. </p><p>However, this constellation of findings may represent one of several other clinical entities not related to limitations of coronary blood flow. For patients with an acute or subacute clinical presentation, at least four other causes of moderately or markedly elevated of troponin have been identified other than chronic elevations such as in end stage renal disease and rare analytical causes: acute myocarditis, stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, and trauma. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute myocarditis is the diagnosis most apt to mimic acute (thrombotic) MI, both in terms of clinical presentation and troponin results, particularly when the troponin is very elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a series of 60 patients who presented with possible acute MI but had normal coronary arteries, 30 had magnetic resonance imaging features of acute myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, acute myocarditis should be a consideration in patients, especially women, who present in this manner and have normal coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One possible indication for cardiovascular magnetic resonance would be to determine the source of myocardial damage in a patient with elevated troponin levels but without obstructive coronary disease at invasive coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Takotsubo syndrome (&quot;Stress cardiomyopathy&quot;) should also be considered, but in general, elevations of cTn are more modest in this condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolism with acute right heart overload and heart failure can have a rising <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> falling pattern of hs-cTn values and thus mimic acute MI. The troponin elevations are more often modest in these disorders and, among patients with pulmonary embolism, usually resolve within 40 hours in contrast to the more prolonged elevation with acute myocardial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults#H5467663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Cardiac biomarkers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Troponin release can be induced by trauma, as occurs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, electrical cardioversion, or implantable cardioverter defibrillator firings. In one study of 38 patients undergoing elective cardioversion using a median cumulative energy of 300 Joules, for example, three patients had minimal elevations of cTnI suggestive of subtle myocardial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>There is no single threshold value that reliably discriminates any of these causes.&nbsp;The use of serial values to assess for a dynamic rise or fall in concentration, the absolute concentration, and the clinical syndrome should all be integrated by the clinician to make an assessment regarding the cause of myocardial injury. </p><p>Other causes of troponin elevation are discussed separately.

The following are possible explanations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is anticipated that the initial troponin will return elevated. A common explanation for a normal result is that insufficient time has passed from the onset of symptoms to the time of the test to allow for the troponin to rise significantly. It may be appropriate to label these patients as having unstable angina. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may present with an elevated hs-cTn but without a changing pattern of values. This may represent the late presentation of acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Alternatively, they could have the elevations due to structural heart disease and might also have unstable angina.

With some assays but not troponin assays, values can be increased but with cTn, thus far, the only reports suggest that values are decreased. At times, patients may be unaware they are even taking Biotin. Biotin is cleared renally so in that situation, additional scrutiny may be necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the interim, clinicians should be aware that this effect exists. Clinicians should consider asking patients whose initial troponin value is unexpectedly normal or unexpectedly abnormal whether they may be taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> or a multivitamin that might contain biotin.

This possibility certainly should be considered along with other causes of cTn elevations including renal disease, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], which may be present prior to surgery and can often be detected with the use of a preoperative cTn value. &#160; &#160;</p><p>Given the important prognostic significance of an elevated cTn value after surgery, we do advocate obtaining a baseline sample for cTn in those at high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The value observed preoperatively has substantial predictive value for postoperative events as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. These patients then deserve surveillance troponin monitoring postoperatively. If elevations occur, an evaluation to define the cause of the new or increased elevation is suggested. Those with a changing pattern of values are at particular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Those without a changing pattern still have underlying cardiovascular disease and deserve an evaluation but those with a changing pattern are at greater short-term risk. The optimal response to such elevations is not established at this time and therefore, consultation and clinical judgment are all that can be routinely recommended. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H669531600\"><span class=\"h1\">CORONARY ARTERY REVASCULARIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been considerable controversy as to whether elevated cardiac biomarkers after percutaneous coronary intervention are associated with a worse prognosis. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural myocardial infarction following percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is defined as increases in troponin greater than 10 times the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile upper reference limit plus either new pathological Q waves or left bundle branch block on the postoperative electrocardiogram, angiographically documented new graft or native coronary occlusion, or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium. The higher the peak value or the integrated area under the curve, the worse the prognosis. It is also clear that when the baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) value is elevated, the post-surgical values will be higher. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H107850186\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'After revascularization'</a>.)</p><p>Troponin has been studied in patients who have undergone CABG:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic value of troponin elevations was illustrated in a study of 590 patients in whom a cTnT concentration &gt;3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (3400 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L)</span> 24 hours after CABG correlated best with a perioperative MI as defined by new Q waves on the electrocardiogram and creatine MB fraction (CK-MB) &gt;100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> within 48 hours after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin#H516921337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biomarkers of cardiac injury other than troponin&quot;, section on 'Why troponin is preferred'</a>). The sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, were 90, 94, 41, and 99 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognostic value of troponin elevations was addressed in a report of 224 patients in whom cTnT and CK-MB were measured every eight hours after cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a multivariable analysis, serum troponin T concentrations &ge;1.58 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> ([1580 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L]</span> which represented the upper quintile) were the strongest predictor of postoperative death or shock immediately postoperatively or at 18 to 24 hours. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An investigation of 1365 patients supports this contention for cTnI as well. Measurements were taken 2 and 24 hours after surgery. After multivariate correction, cTnI levels were predictive of both 30-day and one-year mortality, and there was a gradation of risk with those with the highest values manifesting the greatest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p>It should be appreciated that not all elevations of troponin after CABG are indicative of an ischemic injury due to an intravascular event. The process of cardiopulmonary bypass itself, issues related to cardiac preservation, and mechanical injury can all contribute. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data suggest that until troponin values are very elevated, most of the damage is subendocardial and often apical, suggesting a nonvascular etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Even when marked elevations occurred, only 67 of 118 patients had a primary graft occlusion; this emphasizes the need to consider the etiology of biomarker elevations and not assume that all elevations are due to vascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troponin-testing-clinical-use/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3511080778\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL POPULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although serum or plasma troponin is most commonly measured in patients with a suspected acute event, troponin may be elevated in the absence of an acute event.
