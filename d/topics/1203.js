It is most commonly manifested as an unsteady gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Ataxia is usually the result of cerebellar dysfunction. However, disturbances at many levels of the nervous system can also affect coordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, ataxia that develops as the result of loss of sensory function (such as proprioception) would be described as a sensory ataxia.</p><p>Acute ataxia is an uncommon presenting complaint in children. Although causes of acute ataxia include life-threatening conditions such as mass lesions and central nervous system (CNS) infection, the majority of children have a benign, self-limited process. Historical features, specific physical findings, and selected ancillary studies can identify most causes of ataxia, particularly those that are serious and require stabilization and intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that cause acute ataxia include acute infections, post-infectious inflammatory conditions, toxins, tumors, and trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79383 \">table 1</a>). Based upon small observational series of patients referred to the emergency department or a pediatric neurology specialist, the most frequent diagnoses are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cerebellar ataxia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug intoxication </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome</p><p/><p>Of these, acute cerebellar ataxia is most common, accounting for 50 to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p>Historical features such as the time course of the presentation and the age of the child may suggest a particular diagnosis. Conditions such as migraine syndromes, seizures, and certain inborn errors of metabolism cause recurrent ataxia. By comparison, chronic or progressive ataxia usually develops with congenital anomalies, degenerative diseases, or hereditary ataxias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life-threatening causes of acute ataxia in children are fortunately uncommon. For those conditions that create a mass effect, signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (such as vomiting, headache, or papilledema) are typically evident. Etiologies include tumors, hemorrhage, stroke, and infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of all childhood brain tumors, 45 to 60 percent arise in the brainstem or cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Posterior fossa tumors may present with slowly progressive ataxia and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. These symptoms include progressive night-time or early morning headache with <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span>. The absence of these symptoms, however, does not exclude the diagnosis of a brain tumor. In addition to ataxia, physical findings that may be noted with a posterior fossa tumor include papilledema, cranial neuropathies, and other focal neurologic abnormalities. Acute decompensation can occur as the result of obstructive hydrocephalus, hemorrhage into the lesion, or edema.

Injury that causes intraparenchymal hemorrhage is typically severe. In comparison, a child with a ruptured vascular malformation typically has no significant antecedent trauma. A history of trauma may not be immediately forthcoming for children with inflicted injury.

Conditions that cause cerebrovascular disease are rare in children and include sickle cell disease, hypercoagulable states (as can occur with systemic lupus erythematous), and homocystinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute stroke in sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H75107488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>Vertebrobasilar artery dissection following a neck injury can also cause stroke, manifested as acute ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life-threatening infectious processes that cause acute ataxia (such as cerebellar abscesses) generally produce other symptoms as well. Rarely, ataxia may be an early symptom of meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with inflammatory post-infectious conditions, such as acute post-infectious demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), may also develop ataxia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar abscesses, often caused by contiguous spread of infection from either otitis media or mastoiditis, can cause ataxia and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Associated symptoms related to a mass effect in the posterior fossa include headache and vomiting. Rapid clinical deterioration with meningismus can occur when the abscess ruptures into the intraventricular or subarachnoid space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem encephalitis is a rare cause of acute ataxia that is associated with high morbidity. Patients are often febrile and have other neurologic findings such as cranial nerve abnormalities, mental status changes, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes are commonly seen. Infectious agents associated with brainstem inflammation include Listeria monocytogenes, Lyme disease, EBV, and herpes virus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes infection&quot;, section on 'Rhombencephalitis'</a>). Reflexes are preserved in patients with encephalitis, which helps to differentiate them from those with Guillain-Barr&eacute; or Miller Fisher syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Common conditions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADEM, an uncommon inflammatory demyelinating disease that typically follows an infection, may have ataxia as part of its presentation. Common neurologic features of ADEM include seizures, cranial neuropathies, weakness, hemiparesis, sensory deficits, and transverse myelitis. Systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and meningismus may also occur. Altered mental status and the fulminant onset of multifocal neurologic deficits distinguish ADEM from benign etiologies such as acute cerebellar ataxia. Although most patients slowly recover and have no neurologic deficit, mortality from postinfectious ADEM may be as high as 5 percent.

It is a self-limited syndrome that is frequently postinfectious and typically seen in children between two and five years of age. The diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia can only be made after exclusion of other more serious illnesses such as toxic ingestions, central nervous system infection, structural intracranial lesions, metabolic derangement, or neurodegenerative disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cerebellar ataxia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy thought to result from a post-infectious immune-mediated process. It has also been reported following vaccination. GBS predominantly affects motor nerves, although as many as 15 percent of children with GBS also lose sensory input to the cerebellum and develop sensory ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

The prognosis for children with GBS is generally better than that for adults. As many as 85 percent of children can be expected to have an excellent recovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4274339423\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxic exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxic exposure (typically ingestion of an oral medication) is responsible for up to 30 percent of cases of acute childhood ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Associated symptoms may include mental status changes such as lethargy, confusion, or inappropriate speech or behavior.

Some substances associated with abuse can be identified in routine urine toxicology screens. A few medications and toxins (such as anticonvulsants, ethanol, and lead) can be identified with specific blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Labyrinthitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation of the vestibular apparatus, often from bacterial or viral infections such as otitis media, causes acute labyrinthitis. Symptoms include hearing loss, vomiting, and intense vertigo exacerbated by head movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Labyrinthitis may be difficult to distinguish from acute cerebellar ataxia in a toddler.

Benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) can be difficult to distinguish from ataxia in young children. Children with BPV may have a family history of migraine, and some develop typical migraines later in life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of migraine in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Benign paroxysmal vertigo'</a>.)</p><p>Associated symptoms such as headache and vomiting, as well as the episodic course, distinguish migraine syndromes from other causes of acute ataxia.

Other epileptic features (such as mental status change or abnormal eye movements) may be noted. However, nonconvulsive seizures (without alterations of consciousness or abnormal movements) may manifest as ataxia alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome</strong> &ndash; Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS), also known as opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia, is a rare syndrome that includes opsoclonus along with diffuse or focal body myoclonus and truncal titubation with or without ataxia and other cerebellar signs. Ataxia of trunk and limbs with falling is often the first symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients subsequently develop myoclonus and opsoclonus (spontaneous, involuntary, arrhythmic, conjugate, multidirectional saccades occurring in all directions of gaze without a saccadic interval). Encephalopathy of varying severity can accompany motor symptoms. In children, a moderate to severe sleep disturbance is common. All children with OMS should be evaluated for neuroblastoma. As many as 50 percent of children with OMS have an underlying neuroblastoma; symptoms of OMS precede the diagnosis of neuroblastoma in about one-half of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opsoclonus-myoclonus-syndrome#H24047689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pediatric syndrome'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inborn errors of metabolism</strong> &ndash; Numerous inborn errors of metabolism affecting the central and peripheral nervous system may lead to episodic presentations of acute ataxia. A child with one of these yet undiagnosed metabolic disorders may present acutely with the first episode of ataxia and metabolic decompensation in the setting of an intercurrent illness and poor dietary intake. Specific disorders include urea cycle disorders, amino acidopathies, mitochondrial disorders, and organic acidopathies.

Patients develop an unsteady gait that progresses to motor weakness, ascending paralysis, and areflexia. Fever, headache, and mental status changes are characteristically absent. A neurotoxin in the tick saliva causes the symptoms. The onset of symptoms of tick paralysis occurs only after a female tick has attached and begun feeding.

Observers may not recognize coordination difficulties until maturational motor milestones are delayed, at which point the child may present for acute evaluation. Congenital anomalies of the posterior fossa include Dandy-Walker syndrome, Chiari malformation, encephaloceles, agenesis of the cerebellar vermis and cerebellar aplasia, dysplasia, or hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Degenerative/genetic</span> conditions</strong> &ndash; Degenerative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic conditions associated with chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progressive ataxia include ataxia-telangiectasia, spinocerebellar ataxia, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, Niemann-Pick disease, sialidosis, Friedreich ataxia, abetalipoproteinemia, vitamin E deficiency, GM2 gangliosidosis, Refsum disease, dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica (previously, Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I), and multiple sclerosis.

Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) and metabolic syndromes usually present with a slower, more progressive onset of symptoms, usually over a few days. A slower and relatively insidious course is characteristic of brainstem and cerebellar tumors, although medulloblastomas may grow rapidly, and acute decompensation may occur secondary to obstructive hydrocephalus or hemorrhage into the lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms &ndash; Important associated symptoms include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Otalgia, vertigo, and vomiting in association with acute ataxia suggest acute labyrinthitis.

The approach to the neurologic examination of a child is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children#H10928992\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p>Findings that are associated with various causes of acute ataxia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mental status</strong> &ndash; Abnormal mental status suggests ingestion, ADEM, meningitis, encephalitis, or stroke. Lethargy may be present in many inborn errors of metabolism. By comparison, children with post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia are normally alert and interactive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cranial nerves</strong> &ndash; Abnormalities of cranial nerve function suggest posterior fossa lesions, brainstem encephalitis, or the Miller Fisher syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Motor examination</strong> &ndash; Children with the acute onset of weakness may stagger as an attempt to compensate. This gait abnormality may be mistaken for true ataxia and has been called &quot;paretic&quot; ataxia. Paretic ataxia is proportional to the degree of weakness. It may be due to Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS), botulism, myasthenia gravis, transverse myelitis, or tick paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in patients with GBS, botulism, and tick paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sensory examination</strong> &ndash; Impairment of proprioceptive input may result in sensory ataxia, as may occur with GBS. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebellar examination</strong> &ndash; A cerebellar lesion is the likely cause of ataxia for a patient with an abnormal cerebellar examination. However, patients with significant cerebellar dysfunction may have no specific findings. Cerebellar signs include abnormalities in gait, speech, and coordination of voluntary movement. Gait is typically wide-based, unsteady, lurching, or staggering. Speech abnormalities include fluctuations in clarity, rhythm, tone, and volume. Patients may have difficulty maintaining truncal position (titubation). Coordination of voluntary movement, as demonstrated with over- or under-shooting (best seen on finger-nose testing) and difficulty with rapid alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia), is poor. Hypotonia and tremor may also occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Findings that localize the disorder within the cerebellum include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vermis (midline cerebellar) lesions cause dysarthria, truncal titubation and gait abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres result in ipsilateral limb dysmetria, hypotonia, and tremor.

In a retrospective review of 40 cases of acute childhood ataxia evaluated in the emergency department at one institution, nearly half of the 35 drug screens sent were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood glucose</strong> &ndash; A bedside test for blood glucose will quickly identify children with hypoglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic evaluation</strong> &ndash; For children with episodic acute ataxia and other features that suggest an inborn error of metabolism (such as altered mental status or family history), the following tests may be useful: liver function tests, blood pH, CBC, quantitative amino acid determinations of blood and urine, serum lactate, pyruvate and ammonia levels, and urine organic acids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination</strong> &ndash; CSF examination is rarely indicated for the emergent evaluation of a child with acute ataxia. Moderate CSF protein elevation can occur in acute cerebellar ataxia, ADEM, and multiple sclerosis. CSF protein is also usually elevated in Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, but it may be normal in as many as 20 percent of children within a week of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Neuroimaging should be obtained before a lumbar puncture is performed when there is concern for increased intracranial pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CSF should be obtained whenever there is concern for CNS infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-encephalitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral encephalitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging should be obtained for patients with acute ataxia who have altered levels of consciousness, focal neurologic signs, cranial neuropathies, marked asymmetry of ataxia, concern for a mass lesion, or a history of trauma. Imaging may also be helpful when considering a diagnosis of exclusion, such as acute cerebellar ataxia or a conversion disorder.</p><p/><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for patients with acute ataxia, although MRI may be difficult to obtain emergently. It is superior to computed tomography (CT) for detection of posterior fossa lesions such as tumors, strokes, and abscesses. In addition, patients with demyelinating diseases or brainstem encephalitis may have abnormalities detected with MRI.</p><p>CT is generally more available emergently than MRI. CT can usually detect conditions that require immediate surgical intervention such as hydrocephalus, traumatic injury, and many mass lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrophysiologic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrophysiologic studies are rarely necessary for the evaluation of acute ataxia. In consultation with a pediatric neurologist, EEG is indicated for children who may be having seizures, as suggested by altered levels of consciousness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluctuating clinical signs. EEG may also demonstrate nonspecific abnormalities that are clues to a metabolic etiology or toxic exposure. Although electrophysiologic studies are the most specific and sensitive tests for diagnosis of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, they may not be helpful early in the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">ALGORITHMIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with acute ataxia have a disturbance in the smooth, accurate coordination of movements that is most commonly manifested as an unsteady gait. Although many causes of acute ataxia are benign, patients with life-threatening processes must be quickly identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79383 \">table 1</a>). Clinical manifestations and selected ancillary testing can identify conditions requiring stabilization and intervention (such as increased intracranial pressure from a tumor or intracranial hemorrhage) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77260\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77260 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Historical features typically distinguish episodic and chronic conditions that cause ataxia from those that are acute (with the exception of the initial presentation of an episodic condition).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Episodic conditions</strong> &ndash; Migraine syndromes such as basilar migraines usually have clinical features such as headache and vomiting. There may be a family history of migraine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of migraine in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The recurrence of ataxia with altered awareness suggests the diagnosis of a nonconvulsive seizure disorder, although some patients may have neither altered awareness nor abnormal movements. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with inborn errors of metabolism typically have other symptoms such as altered mental status.

A sudden change in symptoms, however, may be the result of an acute condition. As an example, a child with chronic ataxia taking anticonvulsants who becomes acutely worse may have a toxic drug level.

Although a negative CT scan is reassuring, patients with neck trauma may require further evaluation to identify a vertebrobasilar artery dissection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening conditions'</a> above.)</p><p>Acute ataxia in a patient with head injury and a normal CT scan may result from a post-concussive syndrome.

Either computed tomography (CT) of the head or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are indicated depending on the clinical circumstances and availability. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening conditions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CT</strong> &ndash; Life threatening conditions that may be diagnosed on CT include posterior fossa tumor, hydrocephalus, cerebellar abscess, increased intracranial pressure with tonsillar herniation, and stroke. The CT scan is typically normal for patients with meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, or ADEM. If the CT scan is negative, a lumbar puncture is indicated if meningitis is suspected to obtain CSF for analysis and culture.

Appropriate subsequent management includes supportive care, administering an antidote (when one is available), or adjusting the medication dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weakness, areflexia</strong> &ndash; Children with acute ataxia, weakness, and areflexia are likely to have GBS or Miller Fisher syndrome. Further diagnostic evaluation may include electrophysiologic studies. Treatment focuses on supportive care, although some patients may receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> therapy or plasma exchange.

The presence of an attached tick and improvement in symptoms after tick removal clinches this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tick-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tick paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opsoclonus-myoclonus</strong> &ndash; Neuroblastoma is common among children with opsoclonus-myoclonus (although the percentage of children with neuroblastoma who have this paraneoplastic syndrome is small). Consequently, children with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome should receive an aggressive oncologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging evaluation of neuroblastoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute otitis <span class=\"nowrap\">media/vertigo</strong></span> &ndash; Inflammation of the vestibular apparatus (with or without infection) may cause vertigo. Vertigo may be difficult to distinguish from ataxia in young children. Suppurative otitis media that causes labyrinthitis may require myringotomy, in addition to antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recent viral illness</strong> &ndash; Post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia is one of the most common causes of acute ataxia in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia/abstract/2,3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,11</a>]. Patients are typically afebrile, with normal mental status. A careful history and physical examination may exclude many other causes of acute ataxia. To establish the diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia, a urine toxicologic screen, examination of CSF (to exclude meningitis or encephalitis) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imaging (to exclude a significant intracranial process) may be considered, particularly for children who are irritable or have an equivocal neurologic examination.

Patients typically have physical findings that are physiologically inconsistent, such as a narrow-based gait and elaborate &quot;near falls.&quot; Evaluation for this condition should include a urine toxicologic screen and, for post-menarchal girls, a urine pregnancy test. Some patients may require imaging to be certain that there is no significant intracranial lesion associated with the symptoms. A psychosocial evaluation or referral should be considered.
