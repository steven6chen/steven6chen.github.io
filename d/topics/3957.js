GVHD occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the transplant recipient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical manifestations of acute GVHD include a classic maculopapular rash; persistent nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emesis; abdominal cramps with diarrhea; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration. In contrast, patients with chronic GVHD commonly demonstrate skin involvement resembling lichen planus or the cutaneous manifestations of scleroderma; dry oral mucosa with ulcerations and sclerosis of the gastrointestinal tract; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical and histologic features'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute GVHD.

However, this conventional division has been challenged by the recognition that signs of acute and chronic GVHD may occur outside of these designated periods. This observation has led to the increased use of clinical findings, rather than a set time period, to differentiate between acute and chronic GVHD. The widely accepted National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria used to diagnose GVHD classify manifestations of GVHD as &quot;diagnostic&quot; or &quot;distinctive&quot; of chronic GVHD or as common to both acute and chronic GVHD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63007\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63007 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The initial signs and symptoms of acute GVHD most commonly occur around the time of white blood cell engraftment. Although initial definitions of acute GVHD required an onset of symptoms before 100 days post transplantation, the current National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria use clinical findings, rather than a set time period, to differentiate between acute and chronic GVHD. As such, patients presenting with typical findings of acute GVHD prior to day 100 are considered to have &quot;classic acute GVHD,&quot; whereas patients presenting with the same findings after day 100, typically upon reduction of immunosuppression, are categorized as having &quot;late onset acute GVHD&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some clinicians also use the terms &quot;early onset acute GVHD&quot; or &quot;hyperacute GVHD&quot; to describe symptoms of acute GVHD occurring within 14 days of transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver are the principal target organs in patients with acute GVHD.

The rash initially involves the nape of the neck, ears, shoulders, the palms of the hands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72825 \">picture 2</a>), and the soles of the feet. It can be described as a sunburn and may be pruritic or painful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66097\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66097 \">picture 3</a>). From these initial areas of presentation, the rash may spread to involve the whole integument, eventually becoming confluent. In severe GVHD, the maculopapular rash forms bullous lesions with toxic epidermal necrolysis mimicking Stevens-Johnson syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59418\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59418 \">picture 4</a>).

Gastrointestinal involvement usually presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain, but may also manifest as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Confirmation of the diagnosis is provided by pathologic evaluation of tissue obtained by upper endoscopy, rectal biopsy or colonoscopy.</p><p>In a prospective study, 27 patients with suspected acute GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract underwent endoscopic evaluation of both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract with biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Acute GVHD was confirmed in 18 patients (67 percent) with 15 demonstrating diffuse upper and lower gastrointestinal tract involvement. Biopsy of endoscopically normal tissue demonstrated GVHD in both the upper gastrointestinal tract (6 of 10 patients) and lower gastrointestinal tract (6 of 13 patients). Rectal biopsy identified the majority of cases (16 of 18), including all 16 cases with colonic involvement. </p><p>This and other studies suggest that most cases of acute GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract can be identified by rectal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. However, a negative rectal biopsy does not rule out gastrointestinal GVHD. Further evaluation with upper endoscopy or colonoscopy should be performed for patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal involvement in the setting of a negative rectal biopsy. </p><p>The diagnosis of gastrointestinal involvement requires pathologic evaluation of the tissue.

Confirmation of the diagnosis is performed by pathologic evaluation of tissue obtained by rectal biopsy or colonoscopy.</p><p>Patients with acute GVHD can develop severe diarrhea, occasionally exceeding 10 liters a day. The stool may initially be watery, but frequently becomes bloody. Maintenance of adequate fluid balance may be extremely difficult in such patients. The blood loss can result in significant transfusion requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. It is not unusual for patients to require frequent transfusions of packed red blood cells per day to maintain a stable hematocrit.</p><p>The diarrhea is secretory and characteristically continues despite fasting and occurs day and night. It can be accompanied by crampy abdominal pain that can also be difficult to manage. Severe ileus may develop in association with acute GVHD or result from increased opioid use required to control the physical discomfort.</p><p>From a diagnostic viewpoint, diarrhea, independent of the presence of acute GVHD, is a common occurrence following HCT. During the first several weeks, diarrhea may be due to the preparatory regimen or to the administration of nonabsorbable or systemic antibiotics. Later, superinfection and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea must be entertained as possible causes.

On endoscopy, acute GVHD manifests as spotted erythema, aphthous lesions, and denudation of the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. While acute GVHD of the intestine may be suggested by changes on endoscopy, pathologic evaluation of tissue is required for the diagnosis and visually normal mucosa does not eliminate the possibility of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A rectal biopsy is usually helpful in making the diagnosis of acute GVHD affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

Grade I(A) GVHD is characterized as mild disease, grade II(B) GVHD as moderate, grade III(C) as severe, and grade IV(D) life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>The IBMTR grading system defines the severity of acute GVHD as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade A &ndash; Stage 1 skin involvement alone (maculopapular rash over &lt;25 percent of the body) with no liver or gastrointestinal involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade B &ndash; Stage 2 skin involvement; Stage 1 to 2 gut or liver involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade C &ndash; Stage 3 involvement of any organ system (generalized erythroderma; bilirubin 6.1 to 15.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> diarrhea 1500 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade D &ndash; Stage 4 involvement of any organ system (generalized erythroderma with bullous formation; bilirubin &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> diarrhea &gt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> OR pain OR ileus)</p><p/><p>Grading is important in terms of assessing the response to prophylaxis or treatment, impact upon survival, and association with graft-versus-leukemia effect. Patients with moderate to severe GVHD have a significantly higher mortality rate compared with those with mild disease. As an example, estimated five-year survival rates of patients with grade III (C) and grade IV (D) acute GVHD are 25 and 5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, caution must be used when applying these estimated survival rates to current patient population given changes in post-HCT care. Current preventive regimens may alter overall outcomes and expressions of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, patients with the same grade but different patterns of skin, gut, or liver involvement often have significantly different outcomes. On occasion, patients will present with stage IV GVHD of a single organ; although most clinicians would consider such a manifestation severe disease, the particular organ involved has clear prognostic implications. As an example, a patient with stage IV cutaneous GVHD alone would be expected to have a much more favorable outcome than a patient with stage IV gastrointestinal GVHD alone, although both have overall grade IV GVHD. As a result, attempts have been made to create a new staging system that provides better prognostic information and permits patient comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].
