In contrast, a <strong>predictive</strong> factor is capable of providing information on the likelihood of response to a given therapeutic modality. Such markers are either within the target of the treatment, the surrounding stroma, or serve as modulators or epiphenomena related to expression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of the target.

The main findings were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with patients without elevated CTCs, those with elevated CTCs at baseline (47 percent) had shortened PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.73-2.14) and OS (HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.42-3.19). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with increasing CTCs three to five weeks after the start of a new line of therapy had worse PFS (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.48-2.32) and OS (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.68-3.03) compared with those whose CTCs did not rise. A similar association between rising CTCs and survival outcomes was noted at weeks 6 to 8. </p><p/><p>In addition, the role of CTCs to guide treatment decisions for women with metastatic breast cancer was prospectively evaluated in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 0500 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For this trial, 595 women with metastatic breast cancer who underwent chemotherapy had evaluation for CTCs at baseline and then after one cycle. Women whose CTCs remained elevated after the first cycle of therapy were randomly assigned to either continue their initial treatment plan or to change of chemotherapy. The main findings of this trial are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 126 women with persistently elevated CTCs after their first cycle of chemotherapy, changing to an alternate regimen had no difference in OS compared with continuation of the initial regimen (median 12.5 versus 10.7 months, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an overall prognostic value of elevated CTCs.

However, their role in the monitoring of patients remains controversial.
