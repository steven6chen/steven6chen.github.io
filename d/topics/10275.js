Certain rheumatic disorders, including dermatomyositis, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, and systemic sclerosis, are associated with an increased risk of malignancy and in some instances may be the result of cancer-induced autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In addition, treatments for rheumatic diseases may also increase malignancy risk.</p><p>Conversely, some malignancies may present or be associated with joint, muscle, and soft tissue manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. The malignancies with the most frequent musculoskeletal findings are leukemias and lymphomas, but paraneoplastic syndromes also occur with solid tumors. Additionally, therapies for malignancy sometimes cause rheumatic disease syndromes.</p><p>Specific rheumatic diseases and risk of malignancies, the contribution of antirheumatic drug therapies to such risk, paraneoplastic rheumatic disorders and rheumatic presentations of malignant disorders, and rheumatic symptoms or disorders caused by anti-tumor therapies will be reviewed here. The relationship of inflammatory myositis to malignancy is discussed in detail separately.

The reasons for this risk are not well defined, but they are likely to involve both chronic inflammation triggering malignancy and autoimmunity arising as a byproduct of naturally occurring anti-tumor immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Rheumatic diseases in this group include dermatomyositis, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, and systemic sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

A wide array of cancer types may be seen in these diseases, and, in dermatomyositis, the risk of cancer is increased in the first five years of disease. The strength of this association and recommendations for initial screening for malignant disease in patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory myopathy are presented separately.

Drugs used to treat the disease, including alkylating agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy, may contribute to the risk, although not all patients with RA who develop malignancies have been treated with any of these drugs. The etiology of neoplasia in such patients may include immune dysregulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic immune activation. The risk of lymphoproliferative diseases in RA is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Virus-associated malignancies may be increased in systemic lupus erythematosus, whereas the risk of breast and prostate cancers is less than in the general population.

Ensuring that age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening has been performed is an important first step (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;, section on 'Cancer'</a>). Beyond this, cancer screening should be targeted to risk factors that are unique to each patient.</p><p>For certain disorders, awareness of the particular autoantibodies that are associated with the most risk can help stratify patients. As an example, in myositis, patients with antibodies to nuclear matrix protein-2 and transcriptional intermediary factor 1 (TIF1) gamma are more likely to have cancer within three years of disease onset than patients in other autoantibody groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similarly, in SSc, patients with anti-RNA polymerase III or anti-RNPC3 antibodies are more likely to have cancer-associated SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3657624405\"><span class=\"h1\">PARANEOPLASTIC RHEUMATIC MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of musculoskeletal and vascular immune-mediated conditions may occur that are frequently associated with the presence of an underlying malignancy. In some patients, these disorders remit with treatment of the malignancy, and they can thus be described as paraneoplastic rheumatic manifestations in those patients in whom such a malignancy is detected. Patients with potentially paraneoplastic rheumatic syndromes, such as palmar fasciitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, hypertropic osteoarthropathy, and remitting symmetrical seronegative synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE), should be evaluated for underlying malignancy as part of their care.

Concurrent malignancy is common with this condition; its prevalence among patients with RS3PE has been found to be from 16 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The array of malignancies associated with RS3PE is broad, from hematologic (leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and lymphoma) to solid tumors (prostate, breast, gastrointestinal, lung, ovarian, bladder, and endometrial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The changes in the palmar skin and fascia and the resulting flexion deformities are reminiscent of Dupuytren contracture but are more widespread than in that disease, and progressive changes lead to an appearance and texture of &quot;woody hands&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>].

However, the pathogenesis of (secondary) hypertrophic osteoarthropathy remains poorly defined.

In one series of 111 consecutive patients with pathologically proven lung cancer, clubbing was present in 29 percent; clubbing was more common among women than men (40 versus 19 percent) and in non-small cell compared with small cell lung cancer (35 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].
