The experience derives from interactions among multiple physiological, psychological, social, and environmental factors that may induce secondary physiological and behavioral responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Dyspnea, or breathlessness, encompasses multiple somatic perceptions that are variously described as air hunger, increased effort of breathing, chest tightness, rapid breathing, incomplete exhalation, or a feeling of suffocation. Dyspnea is a multidimensional symptom, consisting of affective as well as physical aspects. Its presence and severity cannot be inferred from physical examination or laboratory investigations&mdash;we must ask about it. It can occur in the absence of physical signs (eg, rapid, deep, or labored breathing) or abnormal findings on investigations such as blood gases or chest radiographs. </p><p>Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing life-threatening or other serious illnesses. The primary tenets of palliative care are symptom management; establishing goals of care that are in keeping with the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences; consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in his or her care; psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support both to patients and their family caregivers, and coordination across sites of care. Palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and is not limited to end of life care. Within an integrated model of medical care, palliative care is provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This topic focuses on the assessment and care of patients with advanced terminal illness who develop dyspnea. An approach to the diagnosis of dyspnea in adults and the management of specific causes of dyspnea are addressed elsewhere as are the management of advanced lung disease, cough, stridor, and hemoptysis in palliative care populations.

In a systematic review of the prevalence of 11 symptoms in patients with advanced illness from any of five diagnoses (cancer, AIDS, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or renal disease), dyspnea was one of only three symptoms to be present in &gt;50 percent of patients from all five groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

This perception arises from the sensory cortex, which integrates information from multiple sources including peripheral and central chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors (arising from large airways, lung parenchyma and the chest wall) and respiratory motor centers (in the medulla as well as motor cortex). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dyspnea may arise from increased ventilatory demand, impairment of the mechanical process of ventilation, or both.

Acute episodes of breathlessness are usually accompanied by feelings of anxiety, fear, and possibly panic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Patients may express fear of dying during an acute episode or when waking in the middle of the night with intense air hunger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

In a number of studies, anxiety is significantly correlated with the intensity of dyspnea but the correlations are low and only explain 9 percent of the variance in the intensity of breathlessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>]. </p><p>Depression scores alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] with anxiety scores are also significantly correlated with the intensity of dyspnea. One study found that depression, not anxiety, was significantly correlated in univariate and multivariate analysis with the effect of dyspnea on the person&rsquo;s activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the relative roles of depression and anxiety may depend on the duration and severity of dyspnea. One study found that patients had higher levels of anxiety during high or medium, as compared with lower levels of breathlessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This study supports the view that anxiety is probably a more prominent factor than depression during acute episodes of breathlessness.

NIV can be delivered using a standard ventilator or a portable ventilator (eg, a pressure support ventilator that provides bilevel positive airway pressure [BPAP]). Clinical benefit has been most strongly demonstrated in acute respiratory acidosis in exacerbations of COPD, hypoxemia from cardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypoxemic respiratory failure in the immunocompromised host, and in patients with advanced neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Midazolam was superior to morphine in controlling both baseline and breakthrough dyspnea.
