Progression of atheromatous plaque at the carotid bifurcation results in luminal narrowing, often accompanied by ulceration. This process can lead to ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack from embolization, thrombosis, or hemodynamic compromise.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease. The management of symptomatic extracranial carotid disease is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other aspects of carotid occlusive disease are reviewed elsewhere.

Although there is no precise time constraint, atherosclerotic carotid disease is considered symptomatic if carotid symptoms occurred within the previous six months. Thus, remote carotid symptoms are not considered as indicative of symptomatic carotid disease.</p><p>Carotid stenosis does <strong>not</strong> cause vertigo, lightheadedness, or syncope. Therefore, these symptoms should not be considered as symptomatic with regard to carotid disease.</p><p>The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease varies by population studied and demographics, with age as the most important factor. The prevalence is low in the general population. In a meta-analysis of four population-based studies with individual data from over 23,000 participants, the prevalence estimates of asymptomatic carotid stenosis (&ge;50 percent of the lumen diameter) for men and women aged &lt;50 years were 0.2 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence estimates for men and women aged &ge;80 years were 7.5 and 5.0 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis#H240467881\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis&quot;, section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1424721844\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of stroke and cardiovascular events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most feared outcome of carotid atherosclerosis is ischemic stroke. The estimated risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (stenosis &ge;50 percent) is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis is also a marker of increased risk for myocardial infarction and vascular death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Thus, asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis is considered a risk equivalent for cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease#H4874544\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Noncoronary atherosclerotic disease'</a>.)</p><p>For this reason alone, intensive medical therapy is indicated for patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis.</p><p>In patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, natural history studies suggest that the majority of strokes caused by carotid artery atherosclerosis are preceded by TIA and that the incidence of unheralded stroke (ie, not preceded by TIA) from carotid disease is relatively low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. TIAs occurred in nearly 70 percent of patients as the qualifying event for entry in the NASCET trial cohort, and observational data suggest that ischemic stroke due to extracranial carotid disease is preceded by TIA in 50 to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. However, these data may be subject to selection bias, as large disabling or lethal strokes were systematically excluded from NASCET and most studies assessing pre-stroke symptoms due to the inability to obtain a direct patient history.</p><p>Some experts have argued that this evidence supports a conservative approach to carotid revascularization (carotid endarterectomy [CEA] or carotid stenting) in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]; TIA occurrence in previously asymptomatic patients may serve as a warning to allow an opportunity to intervene with CEA and prevent disabling stroke, while avoiding operative risk in those who remain asymptomatic. In studies largely performed before the advent of modern intensive medical therapy, however, the rate of unheralded stroke ipsilateral to an asymptomatic but hemodynamically significant extracranial carotid artery stenosis was about 1 to 2 percent annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>], a rate that represented a large incidence on a population basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This perspective was used to support a more aggressive approach to CEA in selected asymptomatic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1424715756\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease is controversial. The following strategies are advocated by different experts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive medical management with statins, antiplatelet agents, treatment of hypertension and diabetes, and healthy lifestyle changes, rather than carotid revascularization. This approach has gained favor with mounting evidence that modern medical therapy has reduced risk of stroke for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease since the landmark carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trials of the 1990s and early 2000s that established the advantage of CEA compared with medical therapy of the time. (See <a href=\"#H1424714856\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revascularization with CEA for most medically stable patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 60 to 99 percent. This approach relies on the evidence of the landmark endarterectomy trials mentioned above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Carotid endarterectomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revascularization only for a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who have a particularly high risk of stroke. This approach relies on the use of markers to determine high stroke risk, a list which includes the progression of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the detection of asymptomatic carotid embolism, carotid plaque burden and morphology, reduced cerebrovascular reserve, and the presence of silent embolic infarcts. (See <a href=\"#H1424716577\" class=\"local\">'Identifying high stroke risk'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The optimal carotid revascularization procedure, whether CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS), is also controversial. However, there is general agreement that the short-term (periprocedural) risk of stroke and death is higher with CAS, while long-term outcomes are similar for CEA and CAS. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Carotid endarterectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Carotid stenting'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients unlikely to benefit from carotid revascularization include those with severe comorbidity due to other medical or surgical illness, patients with a prior ipsilateral stroke associated with persistent disabling neurologic deficits, and patients with total occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Risk factors for morbidity and mortality associated with endarterectomy and stenting should be evaluated in order to identify those who may face unacceptably high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These risk factors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-endarterectomy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid endarterectomy&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid artery stenting and its complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1424721851\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend intensive medical therapy (see <a href=\"#H1424714856\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> below) using all available risk reduction strategies for patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. Currently viable strategies include statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modification consisting of smoking cessation, limited alcohol consumption, weight control, regular aerobic physical activity, and a Mediterranean diet.</p><p>We suggest CEA (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Carotid endarterectomy'</a> below) plus intensive medical therapy, rather than intensive medical treatment alone, for medically stable patients who have a life expectancy of at least five years and a high grade (&ge;80 percent) asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic stenosis at baseline or progression to &ge;80 percent stenosis despite intensive medical therapy while under observation, provided the combined perioperative risk of stroke and death is less than 3 percent for the surgeon and center. This recommendation places a relatively high value on longer-term stroke prevention and a relatively lower value on avoidance of short-term perioperative stroke and death. This approach requires surveillance of carotid artery atherosclerosis, which is most easily accomplished using carotid ultrasound performed yearly for patients with 50 to 79 percent asymptomatic carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Modern medical therapy that includes rigorous and compliant use of statins and antiplatelet agents, treatment of hypertension and diabetes, and healthy lifestyle changes has narrowed the gap between medical and surgical treatment of carotid disease for reducing the risk of stroke. Thus, intensive medical management is a reasonable alternative to CEA in patients with stable or progressive asymptomatic carotid disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1424722024\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations of others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines for the primary prevention of stroke issued in 2014 by the American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ASA)</span> made the following recommendations regarding the management of asymptomatic carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]: (See <a href=\"#H2046482630\" class=\"local\">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis should be prescribed daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a statin.

These guidelines concluded that there were insufficient data to recommend CAS as primary therapy for neurologically asymptomatic patients with 70 to 99 percent diameter stenosis.</p><p>All these guidelines note that the advantage of revascularization with CAS for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease over current medical therapy alone is not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. However, in data from the United States through the year 2014, both CEA and CAS were performed mainly for <strong>asymptomatic</strong> rather than <strong>symptomatic</strong> carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is likely that this situation persists despite the reimbursement policy in the United States of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which covers CAS outside of trials for patients considered high risk for CEA who have symptomatic severe (&ge;70 percent) carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The policy also covers CAS when used in post-approval studies or in clinical trials for patients at high risk for CEA with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50 to 70 percent or asymptomatic carotid stenosis that is &ge;80 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1424714856\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modern medical therapy that includes rigorous and compliant use of statins and antiplatelet agents, along with treatment of hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes, has probably narrowed the gap between medical and surgical treatment of carotid disease for reducing the risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/2,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23-25</a>]. Thus, intensive medical management is a reasonable alternative to endarterectomy in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

However, since the completion of these trials, newer medical regimens have emerged that reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events, including the more widespread and intensive use of statins, antiplatelet agents, antihypertensive agents, and lifestyle modifications, including a reduction in the prevalence of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p>Improvements in medical therapy would diminish the relative risk reduction afforded by CEA for carotid disease and increase the number of patients needed to treat with CEA to prevent one stroke. This issue is particularly important for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, in whom the number needed to treat is already high compared with symptomatic patients.</p><p>Some insight into the changes in medical therapy over the years comes from the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST), which began about a decade after the other major endarterectomy trials. In ACST, the use of lipid lowering drugs rose dramatically over the 10-year course of patient enrollment, from 17 percent in earlier randomization (1993 to 1996) to 58 percent in later randomization (2000 to 2003) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76660\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76660 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A 2004 survey of ACST collaborators indicated that routine lipid lowering therapy would rise to at least 90 percent. Antihypertensive and antiplatelet drug use in ACST was widespread throughout the trial and also increased after randomization. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Endarterectomy trials'</a> below.)</p><p>Some experts argue that modern medical treatment is now as effective as revascularization with CEA or CAS for reducing stroke risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease. The following observations support this hypothesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of prospective data from 11 studies found that the average annual rates of ipsilateral and any-territory ischemic stroke have fallen significantly since the mid-1980s in patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis assigned to medical intervention alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The stroke rates for medically treated patients are now estimated to overlap those reported for patients who had CEA for asymptomatic disease in the major randomized trials such as the VA, ACAS, and ACST trials. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Endarterectomy trials'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective population-based study identified 101 patients with an asymptomatic &ge;50 percent carotid stenosis who were treated with intensive medical management. Over a mean follow-up of three years, there was only one minor ipsilateral stroke, for an average annual stroke rate of 0.34 percent (95% CI 0.1-1.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By comparison, ipsilateral annual stroke rates in patients assigned to medical therapy in the major endarterectomy trials were approximately 2 to 3 percent. However, small patient numbers limit the strength of this study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study from a single tertiary center compared treatment and outcome for two groups of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis of &ge;60 percent: 199 patients who were enrolled from 2000 through 2002 (designated &quot;before 2003&quot;) and 269 patients who were enrolled from 2003 through 2007 (designated &quot;since 2003&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The year 2003 was chosen as the cut point because the center by 2003 had implemented a change to intensive medical therapy for patients with accelerated atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The benefit of CEA for preventing nonperioperative stroke was separately significant for men and women in the subgroup analysis.

That is, the immediate CEA group had a worse event-free survival compared with the delayed group until just prior to two years after surgery, when the immediate CEA group first began to show a better outcome. In contrast, the NASCET trial for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis showed that the benefits of CEA began accruing much earlier (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75669 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67964\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67964 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

The reason for this discrepancy is unclear; failure to detect the relevance of the degree of stenosis in the asymptomatic trials might reflect the imperfections of ultrasound as a sole technique of measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional subgroup analyses in ACST found no significant impact on benefit for CEA related to systolic blood pressure above or below 160 mmHg, plaque echolucency, diabetes, or ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Delay to benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CEA for patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis is a long-term investment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The ACAS and especially the ACST trials showed that the net benefit of CEA is delayed, as the asymptomatic population has an overall worse outcome after CEA for many months to nearly two years because of perioperative morbidity. Significant benefit does not accrue until approximately two years or more after surgery. Early after CEA, perioperative morbidity outweighs the modest (though significant) reduction in stroke risk that accrues following the procedure.

However, the utility of this information is limited in practice, since it may be difficult to obtain the appropriate perioperative complication rates for individual surgeons or centers.</p><p>A review of Medicare recipients undergoing CEA found a higher mortality rate in hospitals that did not participate in major carotid surgery trials, particularly in those centers performing fewer procedures (2.9 percent, versus 1.4 percent in NASCET and ACAS trial hospitals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Low patient volume (less than three CEAs performed every two years) and a greater number of years since licensure of the surgeon have also been associated with worse outcomes following CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The most feared outcome of carotid atherosclerosis is ischemic stroke. The estimated risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (stenosis &ge;50 percent) is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent annually. Asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis is also a marker of increased risk for myocardial infarction and vascular death. (See <a href=\"#H1424715730\" class=\"local\">'Scope of the problem'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis should receive intensive medical therapy using all available risk reduction strategies including statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modification consisting of smoking cessation, limited alcohol consumption, weight control, regular aerobic physical activity, and a Mediterranean diet. (See <a href=\"#H1424721851\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1424714856\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For medically stable patients who have a life expectancy of at least five years and a high grade (&ge;80 percent) asymptomatic carotid stenosis at baseline or have progression to &ge;80 percent stenosis despite intensive medical therapy while under observation, we suggest carotid endarterectomy (CEA), provided the combined perioperative risk of stroke and death is less than 3 percent for the surgeon and center (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1424721851\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Carotid endarterectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1424716577\" class=\"local\">'Identifying high stroke risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEA in asymptomatic patients should be considered a long-term investment, as the benefit of CEA for asymptomatic disease emerges only after a number of years. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Delay to benefit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulating evidence suggests that both carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) and CEA provide similar long-term outcomes for patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid occlusive disease. However, the periprocedural risk of stroke and death is higher with CAS. We suggest <strong>not</strong> treating asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with CAS unless it is performed in the context of a clinical trial in centers with demonstrated low (&lt;3 percent) periprocedural risk for combined stroke and death (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
