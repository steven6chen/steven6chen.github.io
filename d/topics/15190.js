The spectrum of hemostatic abnormalities ranges from abnormal coagulation tests in the absence of clinical manifestations, to massive or fatal thromboembolism. Thrombosis may precede the diagnosis of malignancy by months or years, or it may only occur during treatment or hospitalization. Despite the relatively high incidence of thromboembolism, most patients with cancer never experience a thromboembolic event. Individuals with cancer may also have a higher risk of bleeding with anticoagulation, making decisions about the use of prophylactic anticoagulants more challenging.</p><p>Here we discuss the risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which typically presents as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary embolism (PE), in adults with cancer, as well as the primary prevention of VTE in these individuals.

In most cases, thromboembolic events occur in the setting of a clinically evident malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, some patients who present with VTE are found to have an occult malignancy at the time the VTE occurs or months later. Despite the high frequency of VTE in individuals with cancer, it is important to remember that most individuals with cancer do not develop VTE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21594791\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically apparent VTE occurs in as many as 10 percent of patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Autopsy series have described even higher rates of thrombosis for certain tumor types. One study, for example, found evidence of thrombosis in 30 percent of patients who died of pancreatic cancer; the incidence was over 50 percent in those with tumors in the body or tail of the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The tumor type, location, stage, and time since diagnosis influence VTE risk, along with patient comorbidities and certain cancer therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. Our approach to estimating VTE risk distinguishes between individuals who are hospitalized or outpatient. Within those groups, risk is affected by the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tumor-specific factors</strong> &ndash; Tumor cells can express procoagulant activity that induces thrombin generation; in addition, the patient's non-cancerous tissues may express procoagulant activity in response to the tumor. Blood-borne tissue factor in microparticles may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hypercoagulable state accompanying cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-the-hypercoagulable-state-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of the hypercoagulable state associated with malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anatomic</strong> <strong>factors</strong> &ndash; Some tumors increase VTE risk by externally compressing or directly invading large vessels.

Large <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> tumors can compress major veins leading to deep venous thrombosis in the legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

In contrast, smoking does not appear to significantly increase risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Therapy-associated factors</strong> &ndash; Some chemotherapy agents and high risk surgeries (eg, large intraabdominal or pelvic procedures) increase VTE risk.

Compared with those who did not have a malignancy, patients with a diagnosis of malignancy had a greater incidence of VTE during the initial hospitalization (0.60 versus 0.57 percent, a statistically significant difference). In this study, the malignancies with the highest rates of VTE were cancers of the ovary, brain, pancreas, and lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Malignancies associated with the greatest absolute number of episodes of VTE were cancers of the lung, colon, and prostate, due to the relatively high frequency of these cancers in the population.</p><p>In a Danish cohort of 57,591 individuals with cancer hospitalized for VTE, the incidence rates of VTE were highest in individuals with cancer of the pancreas, brain, liver, multiple myeloma, and any form of advanced-stage cancer (incidence rates: 41, 18, 20, 23, and 28, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Some cancer surgeries, especially large intraabdominal or pelvic procedures, are associated with a higher risk of VTE than other types of surgery (eg, mastectomy). This was demonstrated in a review of 43,808 cancer surgeries from a surgical database, which found that the risk of VTE was highest in patients undergoing esophagectomy, followed by cystectomy, pancreatectomy, gastrectomy, colectomy, lung cancer surgery, and hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The effect of patient comorbidities on postoperative VTE risk was demonstrated in review of 43,808 patients undergoing cancer surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

VTE risk was greater in those with prior history of VTE; multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, gynecologic cancer, sarcoma, or metastasis of unknown origin; and female sex in a patient age 40 to 80 years.

Causality has not been demonstrated, however; and VTE may be a marker rather than an independent risk factor for early mortality. High-quality data to support an improvement in mortality with anticoagulation are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Effects on survival'</a> below.)</p><p>VTE-related deaths are especially common in those with exocrine pancreatic cancer. A systematic literature review of patients with pancreatic cancer reported VTE incidences from 5 to 36 percent, representing a 50-fold increase over the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. One of the studies reported on 1915 patients with pancreatic cancer treated with chemotherapy, in which 690 (36 percent) developed a VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Development of VTE, especially within 1.5 months of diagnosis, conferred a greater likelihood of death (HR: 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.5).</p><p>Cancer-associated VTE is associated with a higher mortality than VTE in the population without cancer. This was shown in a review of eight million patients admitted to the hospital for VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Those with concurrent malignancy had a 94 percent probability of death within six months, whereas those without cancer had a 29 percent probability of dying within the same time period.</p><p>Of note, arterial thrombosis can account for a substantial number of deaths in individuals undergoing chemotherapy. A review of 4466 ambulatory patients with cancer who were receiving chemotherapy reported that thrombosis was one of the three most common causes of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The majority of the deaths related to thromboembolic disease were due to arterial thrombosis (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) rather than venous thromboembolism. Of the 141 deaths that occurred during chemotherapy administration (3.2 percent), the three leading causes of death were cancer progression (71 percent), infection (9 percent), and thromboembolic disease (9 percent total, 5.6 percent arterial, 3.5 percent venous).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF VTE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12797219\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of VTE prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to use anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention takes into account the risk of VTE, which depends on many factors; the risks of bleeding from anticoagulants; and costs, which may impact quality of life (eg, need for injections). Patients are generally stratified according to whether they are inpatients hospitalized for an acute medical illness or surgery, or ambulatory outpatients. Individuals with cancer represent a particularly high-risk group in all of these settings. However, the benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation is unclear in many subsets of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a general rule, we use short-term anticoagulation during periods of high risk (eg, hospitalization for acute medical illness, following major surgery), similar to patients without cancer. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> are all reasonable options.
