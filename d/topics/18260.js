These include crosstalk, pacemaker-mediated or endless loop tachycardias, and repetitive non-reentrant ventriculo-atrial synchronous rhythms. These might be considered functional system malfunctions since the resulting arrhythmia may be deleterious to the patient, although the device is functioning normally and in accord with its programmed specifications.</p><p>A comprehensive discussion of the normal function and programming of permanent pacemakers is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CROSSTALK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a DDD pacemaker, a paced or sensed event in one channel initiates one or more timing circuits in the opposite channel. As a result, the release of an atrial output pulse will initiate an atrioventricular (AV) delay, which will permit a ventricular output pulse at the end of this interval if an R wave is not sensed. A ventricular event that is sensed during the AV interval, considered to be an R wave, will cancel the AV interval, inhibit the ventricular output pulse, and cause the pacemaker to initiate an atrial escape interval.</p><p>Current pacing systems, however, are incapable of recognizing morphologic characteristics of a complex. Any intrinsic complex, output decay, or artifact of electromagnetic interference of sufficient amplitude and frequency response that it is not filtered out by the sense amplifier is treated as a true signal. Although bipolar sensing configuration is believed to minimize far-field sensing, crosstalk can be seen with any sensing configuration. If any signal is interpreted as an R wave, and inhibits the ventricular output and resets the escape interval, the phenomenon is termed crosstalk-mediated ventricular output inhibition.</p><p>When AV nodal conduction is otherwise intact, crosstalk is asymptomatic. If there is first degree AV block, the effective paced rate may be slower than the programmed base rate, because the conducted R wave will occur after completion of the ventricular refractory period initiated by the oversensing of the atrial stimulus. The conducted R wave will be sensed, thereby resetting the atrial escape interval yet again. A clinical catastrophe may occur in the presence of complete AV block combined with crosstalk (in the absence of safety-pacing), as the system will effectively pace the atrium, but the ventricular output may be repeatedly inhibited, leaving the patient asystolic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that predispose to crosstalk associated with the atrial output include a high atrial output (either pulse amplitude, pulse duration, or both), the ventricular sensing channel programmed to a very sensitive setting, and a short post-atrial ventricular blanking period. The post-atrial ventricular blanking period is a very short interval of absolute refractoriness initiated in the ventricular sense amplifier upon completion of the atrial escape interval. It is designed to coincide with the atrial output pulse. The intent of the blanking period is to prevent sensing of the atrial stimulus and, hence, prevent crosstalk. Ventricular blanking periods are often programmable. Lengthening the ventricular blanking period may avoid crosstalk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An effective method to prevent crosstalk is to lengthen the postatrial ventricular blanking period. However, a ventricular premature beat (VPB) that occurs within the ventricular blanking period may not be sensed if the intrinsic deflection of the VPB occurs during the blanking period. Events that are not sensed during the blanking period is a form of functional undersensing. It has the potential for inducing an adverse rhythm triggered by competition. Upon termination of the blanking period, the AV interval timer is allowed to complete, because nothing was sensed by the pacemaker, and a ventricular output pulse will be released. Depending upon the AV interval, this may place a ventricular stimulus on the apex of the T wave and may induce pathologic ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the electrically unstable patient. Thus, the extended blanking period could have an adverse effect, even though the pacing system is functioning in accord with its design and programmed parameters and the occurrence of crosstalk has been effectively prevented. Periods of forced inability to sense or inability to react to a sensed event (ie, refractory periods and blanking periods) should generally be kept as short as possible.</p><p>Since the blanking periods for dealing with crosstalk may be associated with potential problems, a special detection or sensing window on the ventricular channel that immediately follows the blanking period has been incorporated into dual-chamber pacing systems. If an event is sensed during this crosstalk detection window, the logic incorporated in the pacemaker will treat this as if it were true crosstalk. The event sensed during this special detection window causes the ventricular circuit to trigger a ventricular output pulse at the end of an abbreviated AV interval rather than inhibiting its output. This abbreviated AV interval will result in nonphysiologic AV sequential pacing, but will protect the patient from asystole in the presence of crosstalk combined with complete heart block.</p><p>If the sensed event were a true R wave, particularly a ventricular premature beat, the pacing stimulus occurring at a short AV interval would likely occur when the ventricular myocardium is physiologically refractory and would neither capture nor induce any dangerous arrhythmias. When a true R wave is present, rather than crosstalk, the ventricular output that deforms the QRS-ST complex reflects normal sensing, but the pacemaker is automatically and transiently programmed to respond in the triggered mode during this very brief period. The overall phenomenon is generically called &quot;safety pacing.&quot; In many pacing systems, this is a programmable parameter that can be enabled or disabled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INAPPROPRIATE MODE SWITCH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dual chamber pacemakers capable of &quot;tracking&quot; the atrial rhythm recognize very rapid atrial rates and can implement automatic mode switch when specific criteria are met. It is relatively common for the atrial channel of the pacemaker to &quot;see&quot; ventricular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is termed far field R wave (FFRW) sensing. In this setting, a normal rhythm may be double counted on the atrial channel, ie, the true P wave or atrial pacing pulse and the FFRW signal, inducing inappropriate mode switching.</p><p>To manage this, contemporary pacemakers allow the absolute refractory period on the atrial channel, termed the post ventricular atrial blanking period (PVAB), to be programmed to a sufficiently long interval in order to preclude FFRW sensing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PACEMAKER-INITIATED TACHYCARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pacemaker-initiated tachycardia can occur when competition, due to undersensing, functional or otherwise, triggers a native tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Once the tachycardia is initiated, the pacemaker becomes an innocent bystander, being inhibited by the native arrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PACEMAKER-MEDIATED TACHYCARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) is a tachycardia that can only be sustained by the continued active participation of the pacemaker. There are two forms of PMT: endless loop tachycardia and tracking of a native atrial tachyarrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Tracking of a native atrial tachyarrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this type of arrhythmia, the pacemaker senses pathologic atrial activity, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and in a patient with high-grade AV block, the pacemaker acts as an artificial bypass track, resulting in a paced tachycardia at or near the programmed maximum tracking rate. The automatic mode switch algorithm effectively limits this form of PMT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Endless loop tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic form of pacemaker-mediated tachycardia is an endless loop tachycardia (ELT), which results from retrograde conduction from the ventricle to the atrium. The retrograde P wave is sensed by the pacemaker via the atrial lead, and an output to the ventricle is triggered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The essential ingredients for an ELT are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability of the AV node to sustain retrograde conduction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrograde P wave of sufficient amplitude to be sensed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The occurrence of the retrograde P wave during the atrial alert period, which allows it to be sensed and to serve as a trigger to initiate the rhythm</p><p/><p>Most individuals with a normal heart are capable of demonstrating retrograde conduction in the appropriate circumstances. It does not occur during the normal synchronization between the atrium and ventricle, because atrial and AV nodal depolarization renders these tissues physiologically refractory.</p><p>The most common cause of an ELT is a ventricular premature beat (VPB) occurring before the anticipated P wave; if the VPB is appropriately timed, occurring after the AV node and atrial myocardium have recovered, it may cause retrograde depolarization of these structures. Other events that may result in retrograde conduction include an atrial premature beat conducted with either a long PR interval (or PV interval) that permits an echo phenomenon, atrial undersensing or oversensing, and loss of atrial capture.</p><p>There are two manifestations of ELT that are most commonly seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic form, which results in PV pacing at the programmed maximum tracking rate. The sensed P wave is tracked, but the programmed AV interval is extended to delay release of the ventricular output pulse until the maximum tracking rate interval times out. This allows the atrial and AV nodal tissue to physiologically recover, enabling them to be depolarized by the next paced ventricular beat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;balanced&quot; endless loop tachycardia. If retrograde conduction is sufficiently slow and the combination of the retrograde VP and anterograde PV intervals exceeds the maximum tracking rate, an ELT can result that is slower than the maximum tracking rate.</p><p/><p>A variant of ELT has been observed in two patients with heart failure who were receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in which biventricular pacing was achieved with a standard DDDR pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In these cases, the atrial channel was connected to the left ventricular (LV) lead and the right ventricular (RV) lead was placed in the ventricular port of the connector block. This will not occur with contemporary devices designed with three channels (atrium, RV, and LV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of an endless loop tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are a number of management options to prevent or terminate an ELT, the one absolute way to <strong>prevent</strong> an ELT is to program the post ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP) sufficiently long to prevent the pacemaker from sensing and hence tracking the retrograde P wave. Extending the PVARP does not prevent retrograde conduction. A longer PVARP effectively lengthens the total atrial refractory period (TARP), thereby limiting the maximum atrial rate that can be sensed and tracked. If the reduction in the maximum paced atrial rate is not a clinical concern for the patient, increasing the length of the PVARP is often a definitive solution.</p><p>However, many clinicians want the pacemaker to have a mean tracking rate that is higher than that allowed by programming a long PVARP. Since ELT is frequently initiated by VPBs, manufacturers have incorporated automatic PVARP extensions following a VPB. For a pacemaker, a VPB is a sensed ventricular event (R wave) that is not preceded by any paced or sensed atrial activity. The various automatic PVARP extensions, while being effective in some cases, may simply postpone the ELT for one cycle and, more commonly, result in sustained pacemaker inhibition when the P wave is able to conduct with a first degree AV block. The P wave is not seen by the pacemaker because it coincides with the PVARP. The resultant native ventricular depolarization, which is due to anterograde conduction, is called a VPB by the pacing system, reinitiating the longer PVARP for that cycle and sustaining the pacemaker inhibition. However, since VPBs are not the only trigger for an ELT, this automatic post-VPB PVARP extension algorithm is usually only a partial solution.</p><p>Another option for management includes making the atrial channel less sensitive. This may be successful if the retrograde P wave is known to be a lower amplitude than the anterograde or sinus P wave [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, this may result in loss of atrial sensing at higher rates, because the atrial electrogram amplitude can decrease at higher rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>If increasing the PVARP to a sufficient degree to prevent sensing of the retrograde P wave is not an option for prevention of ELT, a variety of tachycardia termination algorithms have been developed. For example, with one common algorithm, after a given number of PV cycles at or above a PMT detection rate, the system automatically inhibits ventricular output for a single beat, extends the PVARP, or alters the PV interval. Algorithms have been effective in terminating a true ELT.</p><p>If the tachycardia is a physiologic atrial rhythm that is being appropriately tracked, there will be an occasional pause in the rhythm in those systems that use an algorithm to either extend the PVARP or withhold a ventricular output pulse. The paced tachycardia will resume with the next cycle as the pacemaker tracks the native atrial rhythm. When the algorithm involves a subtle alteration in the PV interval, a physiologic tachycardia will be allowed to persist without creation of intermittent pauses in the rhythm.</p><p>Shortening or lengthening the PV interval will have the opposite effect on the VP interval. In a true ELT, lengthening the PV interval will not alter the VP interval, because the P wave is triggered by the paced ventricular complex, rather than being independent. In this case, the PVARP lengthening is then initiated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">REPETITIVE NON-REENTRANT VENTRICULOATRIAL SYNCHRONOUS RHYTHMS (AV DESYNCHRONIZATION ARRHYTHMIA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dual chamber AV sequential pacing at relatively rapid rates, whether due to sensor drive or associated with a relatively high programmed base rate, sets the stage for an AV desynchronization arrhythmia, also called repetitive non reentrant ventriculoatrial synchronous rhythms, that may be hemodynamically deleterious and cause symptomatic palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The occurrence of this arrhythmia requires intact retrograde VP conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The pacing system is functioning normally in accord with its programmed parameters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the onset of RNRVAS, an event occurs that triggers one cycle of AV dissociation, resulting in retrograde conduction. The retrograde P wave coincides with the PVARP, precluding it from being sensed. This is intentional and functional undersensing. Hence, a PMT does not occur. However, the atrial depolarization renders the atrial myocardium physiologically refractory. As a result, there may be failure to capture with the next atrial stimulus, which occurs at the end of a relatively short atrial escape interval since the pacing rate is high and in close proximity to the intrinsic atrial depolarization. This is functional atrial noncapture. The time from the atrial depolarization to the ensuing ventricular stimulus occurring at the end of the AV interval provides sufficient time for the atrial myocardium to recover, thereby allowing retrograde conduction to occur. This can result in a rhythm in which there is sustained retrograde conduction, followed each time by an ineffective atrial stimulus.</p><p>The patient may experience palpitations from the retrograde conduction as the atrium contracts against a closed mitral and tricuspid valve, inducing cannon A waves. In addition, there may be hypotension and hemodynamic compromise due to the loss of optimal AV synchrony. This is, by definition, pacemaker syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of an RNRVAS requires minimizing the duration of the refractory periods, allowing all native events to be sensed. If this results in an ELT, then a tachycardia termination algorithm should be used to terminate the PMT. If AV desynchronization arrhythmia is consistently enabled by a true VPB, then a more specific post-VPB PVARP extension algorithm will prevent it. Most PVARP extensions lengthen the PVARP but do not alter the basic pacing interval that will simply sustain this problem because the atrial output pulse will still occur at a time when the atrial myocardium is physiologically refractory.</p><p>A &quot;+PVARP on VPB&quot; algorithm lengthens the PVARP and adds an obligatory atrial alert period following the end of the extended PVARP. As a result, despite the programmed or sensor-driven AV pacing rate, the pacemaker is disabled in favor of an atrial escape interval defined by the &quot;+PVARP on VPB&quot; algorithm for this one cycle. When an atrial stimulus occurs at the end of this atrial escape interval, the atrial myocardium will have physiologically recovered, assuring atrial capture and preventing this arrhythmia. If a native P wave occurs during the atrial alert period, it is sensed and tracked. Either a paced or sensed atrial event will terminate this algorithm and return the pacing system to its previous functional state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL SINGLE CHAMBER ATRIAL PACING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients who require a pacemaker have AV conduction that is prolonged but intact. Such patients may pace their right ventricle a high percentage of the time. It is well recognized that unnecessary ventricular pacing may increase the incidence of both atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>].</p><p>When AV nodal conduction is prolonged, but intact, and the QRS width is normal, programming the pacemaker to minimize ventricular pacing (ie, functional single chamber atrial pacing) is recommended. A number of techniques are used to achieve this end, and these may produce unexpected rhythms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Long programmed AV delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One can achieve functional single chamber atrial pacing by simply programming a very long AV delay (ie, the amount of time after an atrial beat that the pacemaker will wait to sense an intrinsically conducted QRS before pacing the RV). This is a simple approach that can be limited by the pacemaker sensing the intrinsic RV activation late in the QRS. Thus, even if the PR interval is only slightly prolonged, the RV lead may not sense the QRS until more than 300 msec after the P wave. In such cases, it may be difficult or impossible to program a long enough AV delay to avoid ventricular pacing.</p><p>Many patients with mild or moderate PR prolongation would do well most of the time with native conduction, and markedly reduced frequency of RV pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">AV/PV hysteresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With this feature, a basic AV delay is set, but periodically the system extends the AV delay by a programmed amount [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. If a native QRS is sensed during this extended interval, the pacemaker will continue to function with this longer AV delay, allowing native conduction and minimizing ventricular pacing. If AV block worsens, and ventricular pacing is again required, the pacemaker will return to the original, shorter AV delay for a period of time, then it will repeat the test with the longer AV delay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">AAI/DDD pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">AAI/DDD</span> pacing is the most commonly used technique to minimize ventricular pacing. There are subtle differences among the algorithms available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], but the basic design is similar. These devices will initially function as a single chamber, AAI pacemaker, but with continuous ventricular sensing. The system will not attempt to pace the ventricle unless sustained AV block develops (ie, it will allow long PR intervals, the maximum length being programmable or defined by the algorithm, and even one or two non-conducted P-waves [dependent on algorithm]). If loss of AV conduction is sensed, the pacemaker will switch to DDD pacing for some period of time until the algorithm once again looks for intrinsic AV conduction. The rationale for this approach is that most patients will tolerate isolated pauses, and that it is more important to minimize ventricular pacing than it is to ensure that every P wave is followed by a sensed or paced QRS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Modes to minimize ventricular pacing'</a>.)</p><p>An example of a ventricular pacing avoidance algorithm in the setting of AV block is shown based on recordings from a Holter monitor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68792\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef68792 \">waveform 1</a>). Intermittent AV block was present that was not associated with ventricular pacing, but this is consistent with the normal behavior of this algorithm. On the atrial paced beat following a cycle of AV block, ventricular pacing occurs at a foreshortened AV delay of 80 ms despite the programmed AV delay. Sustained AV block will result in a reversion to the DDD mode.</p><p>As a result of the AV dissociation that may occur as the result of a ventricular pacing avoidance algorithm, pacemaker syndrome may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Similarly, algorithms that promote atrial pacing by AV interval extension have also resulted in the occurrence of pacemaker-mediated tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are often preceded by abrupt changes in ventricular cycle lengths (ie, the interval between successive ventricular beats). These events are referred to as short-long-short (SLS) sequences. A common example of an SLS sequence involves ventricular premature beats. The &quot;short&quot; interval between a normal beat and a VPB is followed by a &quot;long&quot; interval before the next normal beat. A SLS sequence occurs if a second VPB occurs after this &quot;long&quot; interval. Such events produce changes in both the activation sequences and refractory periods of ventricular myocardium and the His-Purkinje system, and these alterations increase vulnerability to the onset of VT and VF.</p><p>Normal single and dual chamber pacing can create SLS sequences that trigger VT or VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Such events can occur in a variety of settings, usually due to the response of pacemaker algorithms to atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular ectopy. The incidence of SLS induced VT or VF in pacemaker patients is unknown, but is rarely recognized clinically. In the cohort of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patients discussed below, pacemaker facilitated ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 1 to 4 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Because these patients were already known to be at high risk for such arrhythmias, the incidence in the general population of pacemaker patients is probably substantially lower.</p><p>Pacing algorithms that maximize native conduction and minimize ventricular pacing can allow relatively long ventricular pauses. Thus, it can be theorized that these pacing modalities may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, such an increased risk was not shown in a retrospective analysis of 1055 patients from two large ICD trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Among patients whose devices were programmed DDD, VVI, and managed ventricular pacing modes, VT and VF episodes associated with pacemaker-facilitated SLS sequences occurred in 5.2, 3.3, and 2.6 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Functional single chamber atrial pacing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Modes to minimize ventricular pacing'</a>.)</p><p>Because a ventricular pause is central to the SLS sequence, pacing strategies that minimize such pauses have been proposed as a method for reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. However, such approaches have not proven successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. This failure appears to be due to the relatively short pauses (eg, &lt;1 second), and small changes in cycle length (eg, 40 to 200 msec) that are required to trigger ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90108093\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an unexpected rhythm is observed in a patient with a dual-chamber pacing system, applying the following questions should provide a basis to understanding and managing unexpected rhythms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pacing system functioning normally or not?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the unexpected rhythm initiated by the pacemaker, mediated by the pacemaker, or a result of a specific pacing algorithm?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To fully appreciate the variations that can occur as a result of company specific algorithms, is the provider aware of any algorithms that are programmed &quot;on&quot; and thoroughly understand how these algorithms function?</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexpected-rhythms-with-normally-functioning-dual-chamber-pacing-systems/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stroobandt RX, Barold SS, Vandenbulcke FD, et al.
