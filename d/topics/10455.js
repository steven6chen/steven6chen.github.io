Approximately 90 percent of serous carcinomas are high-grade, and 10 percent are low-grade. Low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum appears to exist on a continuum with serous borderline tumors, which are likely precursor lesions, and has a distinct pathology, clinical behavior, and prognosis compared with high-grade serous carcinoma. Thus, a diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma may be made de novo or following an original diagnosis of serous borderline tumor.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of low-grade serous carcinoma will be reviewed here.

Approximately 60 percent of low-grade serous carcinomas are associated with a serous borderline tumor at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The continuum between these pathologic entities strongly supports a developmental relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, clinical studies of the natural history of patients with low-grade serous cancer show that conversion to high-grade cancers essentially never occurs. </p><p>Furthermore, molecular studies have also supported that low-grade tumors are distinct from high-grade tumors and have a unique developmental pathway. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole genome gene expression profiling shows that borderline tumors are indistinguishable from low-grade tumors and are more similar to normal surface epithelia cells than to high-grade cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. DNA copy number changes in low-grade serous tumors may be important events in the transition from borderline tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple investigators have demonstrated that <em>KRAS</em> and <em>BRAF </em>mutations are frequent in low-grade tumors and exceptionally rare in high-grade cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Of interest, two studies suggest that <em>RAS</em> mutations (but not <em>BRAF</em>) are associated with recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in <em>TP53</em>, a hallmark of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, are not found in low-grade cancers.</p><p/><p>These molecular features support a potential model of disease progression from benign cysts (inclusion cysts) to borderline tumors and then to invasive low-grade serous cancers. Early events (in borderline tumors) would include mutations in<em> RAS</em> (n, K, and H) and <em>BRAF </em>that are mutually exclusive<em>, </em><strong>and </strong>are likely activators of the MAP kinase pathway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322177224\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum is similar to that of other epithelial cancers of the ovary or peritoneum (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>). However, on average, women with low-grade serous carcinoma are younger than those with ovarian cancer of all types. Early reports indicate that the median age at diagnosis is 43 to 46.5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of low-grade serous carcinoma present with disseminated disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage II to IV). The clinical presentation may range from an asymptomatic adnexal mass to significant symptomatology consisting of bloating, early satiety, urinary urgency, and abdominal or pelvic pain. In more advanced cases, women may also present with a pleural effusion or bowel obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1758553858\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma is based on histologic evaluation. This evaluation is performed following removal of the ovary(ies) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsies of the peritoneum. In cases in which primary cytoreductive surgery is deemed inappropriate due to extensive disease or patient comorbidities, the diagnosis is performed following image-guided fine needle <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/core</span> biopsy or laparoscopic biopsies.</p><p>The binary grading system for serous carcinoma was initially proposed in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this system, low-grade serous carcinoma is characterized by mild to moderate nuclear atypia as a primary feature and up to 12 mitoses per 10 high powered fields (HPF) as a secondary feature. By comparison, high-grade serous carcinoma is characterized by marked nuclear atypia and &gt;12 mitoses per 10 HPF. </p><p>Prior to this report, serous carcinomas were most widely graded using a three-tier system; either the Shimizu-Silverberg system, or the system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

It has been widely accepted into clinical practice and incorporated into the 2014 World Health Organization classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, serous borderline tumors with concomitant invasive peritoneal implants have been reclassified as low-grade serous carcinomas.</p><p>In most cases, low-grade serous carcinoma is characterized by low Ki-67 proliferative rates, wild-type p53 expression, and estrogen receptor (ER) expression. However, ER expression is not pathognomonic for low-grade tumors and should not be used to make the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H300437355\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3828770749\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preoperative management of low-grade serous carcinoma is essentially identical to that for all types of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13733533\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the process of the preoperative evaluation, based on findings, a determination should be made as to whether the patient is a candidate for surgery. These include several factors, including age, comorbidities, and extent of disease based on imaging. For the rare patient in whom comprehensive surgical staging is not an option (eg, due to unresectable abdominal disease or the presence of extra-abdominal metastases), neoadjuvant chemotherapy is utilized with the goal of proceeding with interval cytoreduction at a later date. (See <a href=\"#H3083095305\" class=\"local\">'Those in whom primary resection is not feasible'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, if neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being considered, then a histologic diagnosis of serous carcinoma should be confirmed by either image-guided fine needle <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/core</span> biopsy or laparoscopic evaluation and biopsies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562766342\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women suspected of having <span class=\"nowrap\">ovarian/peritoneal</span> cancers should be evaluated with imaging studies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Approximately 85 percent of women with low-grade serous carcinoma have an elevated serum CA 125 preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2850811433\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend genetic testing for familial ovarian cancer syndromes in all women with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In a study of 1915 women with epithelial ovarian cancer, only 4 of 70 (5.7 percent) women with low-grade serous carcinoma carried a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> germline mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. By contrast, the study by Norquist et al of Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 218 demonstrated that the frequency of germline <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>2</em> mutations in patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer was not insignificant, and women with newly diagnosed low-grade serous tumor should undergo genetic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3316126516\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With rare exceptions, primary surgery is the recommended approach for the optimal treatment of low-grade serous carcinoma. There are no distinguishing factors between low-grade serous carcinoma and other histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer in terms of surgical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with apparent stage I disease, comprehensive surgical staging is recommended. In selected young patients with unilateral ovarian involvement, fertility-sparing surgery may be feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management#H401641\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;, section on 'Fertility preservation'</a>.)</p><p>For those patients with stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma, maximum cytoreductive surgery to achieve minimal residual disease (ideally no gross residual disease) is the standard. In an ancillary analysis of GOG 182, 189 women with grade 1 (low-grade) serous carcinoma were accrued. Those women whose primary cytoreductive surgery resulted in microscopic residual disease had a significantly superior progression-free survival and overall survival compared with women with any gross residual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among 145 women with stage IIIB to IV low-grade serous carcinoma treated with primary cytoreductive surgery, those with microscopic residual disease experienced a better progression-free survival and overall survival (median, 97 versus 35 months) compared with women with residual disease &gt;1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The cytoreductive procedure may occur as primary cytoreductive surgery or as interval cytoreductive surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H3083095305\" class=\"local\">'Those in whom primary resection is not feasible'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3665725045\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those undergoing surgery, the approach to adjuvant treatment depends on the stage of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44954731\"><span class=\"h4\">Stage IA, IB, and IC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because stage I low-grade serous carcinoma is extremely rare (approximately 2 to 6 percent of all low-grade serous tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/1,11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,21</a>]), no definitive information exists regarding standard adjuvant therapy. As per the NCCN Ovarian Cancer Guidelines, surveillance is generally recommended for stage IA and IB disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For stage IC, there is no widely accepted standard approach. The NCCN guidelines list a series of options, including observation, <span class=\"nowrap\">taxane/platinum</span> chemotherapy for three to six cycles, or hormonal therapy. The UpToDate authors and editors feel that each of these represents an appropriate option depending on patient and provider preferences, and decisions should be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H2904249352\" class=\"local\">'Stage II to IV'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2904249352\"><span class=\"h4\">Stage II to IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgery for more advanced disease, adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of a <span class=\"nowrap\">taxane/platinum</span> regimen is often administered, typically for six cycles. While the NCCN guidelines include alternative options, such as expectant observation or hormonal therapy, for most patients we continue to suggest adjuvant chemotherapy. Unlike treatment of higher-grade ovarian cancer, there are no known benefits to intraperitoneal chemotherapy or dose-dense <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a></span> chemotherapy over standard chemotherapy, as trials have not provided enough information specifically for low-grade serous carcinoma to support these approaches in this subtype. </p><p>Despite the widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapy for these patients, essentially all of the reports of <span class=\"nowrap\">taxane/platinum</span> chemotherapy in women with newly diagnosed stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma have noted the relative chemoresistance of this subtype compared with high-grade serous carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/10,11,20,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,20,22-25</a>]. These findings have underscored the need for more effective therapy for the first-line treatment of low-grade serous carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H3016568838\" class=\"local\">'Investigational approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, there may be a benefit to maintenance endocrine therapy, though prospective data are needed. In a retrospective single-institution study of women with stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma, those who received hormonal maintenance therapy following completion of primary chemotherapy had an improved progression-free survival compared with women who underwent observation (65 versus 25 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was a trend towards improved overall survival that did not reach statistical significance (116 versus 103 months, respectively). Based on these results and extrapolating from the recurrence setting, one UpToDate contributor offers hormonal maintenance therapy after adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly for those with advanced disease in whom a complete cytoreduction was not achieved, though this is not a uniform practice among our UpToDate experts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3083095305\"><span class=\"h2\">Those in whom primary resection is not feasible</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom initial surgical resection is not appropriate (eg, multiple hepatic or other visceral metastases), an attempt with primary systemic therapy is appropriate. In such cases, we re-image after three cycles to identify patients who can proceed with interval cytoreductive surgery. The approach following surgery mirrors that for patients with higher-grade ovarian cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy appear to have a significantly worse outcome than those who undergo primary surgery followed by chemotherapy, though this a likely consequence of their more extensive disease rather than the sequence of treatments. In a retrospective report of 24 evaluable women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the response rate was only 4 percent (one patient had a complete response), with 88 percent having stable disease and 8 percent having disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Furthermore, the median overall survival for this cohort was only 56.1 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H653414814\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent or metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several options exist for women with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum. These include possible secondary cytoreductive surgery, chemotherapy (using standard definitions for either platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant disease), hormonal therapies, or targeted agents such as angiogenesis inhibitors, or others available on clinical trial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-surgery-for-recurrent-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Surgery for recurrent cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3016568838\" class=\"local\">'Investigational approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>Secondary cytoreductive surgery is considered selectively for a subset of women with relapsed low-grade serous carcinoma. For ovarian cancer of all subtypes, there are no strict criteria for recommending this procedure. In general, ideal patients for such an operative are those with platinum-sensitive disease and a limited number of metastatic sites. In a retrospective study of 41 women with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma, no gross residual disease was achieved in only 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients who had no gross residual disease following secondary cytoreductive surgery had a significantly better median progression-free survival and overall survival from the time of secondary surgery compared with women with gross residual disease (60.3 versus 10.7 months, respectively; and 93.6 versus 45.8 months, respectively). Despite the low rate of achievement of no gross residual disease, some gynecologic oncologists may consider secondary cytoreductive surgery with more enthusiasm for low-grade ovarian carcinomas owing to its relative chemoresistance. </p><p>As in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting, the reported response rates to conventional chemotherapy in the relapsed setting are low. In a study of 58 evaluable women who received a total of 108 separate chemotherapy regimens, the overall response rate was &lt;4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The response rate was 4.9 percent in the platinum-sensitive cohort and 2.1 percent in the platinum-resistant cohort. However, stable disease was observed in over 60 percent of the treatment regimens. In addition, the median progression-free survival was 29 weeks, and 58 percent of women were progression-free at six months. Patients in this study were generally heavily pretreated. It is possible that a cohort of women who have had a more limited number of prior regimens may demonstrate a higher response rate.</p><p>Hormonal therapy also is an option for women with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma. Evidence indicates that a very high proportion of these tumors express the estrogen receptor (ER) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. A wide variety of anti-estrogen agents, many of which are commonly used to treat ER-positive breast cancer, appear to be active in low-grade serous carcinoma. These include the aromatase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fulvestrant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fulvestrant</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate. In a single-institution study, 64 patients with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma received 89 different hormonal therapy regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The objective response rate was 9 percent, and the stable disease rate was 61.8 percent, for a clinical benefit rate of 70.8 percent. Clearly, more studies are needed to define the role of hormonal agents in the management of low-grade serous carcinoma and to also understand the correlation between ER expression and response to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560909888\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there a role for angiogenesis inhibitors?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data to support the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> with chemotherapy as part of a first-line treatment paradigm in this population. This was shown in the ICON7 trial, which compared standard chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Among women with low-grade serous carcinoma, there was no benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy. Importantly, this trial did not include a central pathology review, and it is unlikely that the trial was powered to show a difference in the outcome for this rare ovarian cancer subset.</p><p>For patients who require second- or later-line treatment, however, several studies have reported the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic agents in the treatment of low-grade serous carcinoma. One study reported a 39 percent response rate and 62 percent clinical benefit rate in 17 patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>-containing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In an update to this study, of 45 women who received bevacizumab alone or in combination for recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma, the response rate was 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other small retrospective reports have described response rates ranging between 11 percent in a heterogeneous cohort to as high as 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718948162\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with low-grade serous carcinoma have a substantially prolonged overall survival time compared with women with high-grade serous carcinoma. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with stage I low-grade serous carcinoma, very little information is available in terms of prognosis. In a review of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data set, the mean overall survival for patients with stage I disease was 123 months; the median overall survival had not yet been reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum, the prognosis is clearly superior to that of high-grade serous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, or mucinous carcinoma. In a review of the MD Anderson Low-Grade Serous Tumor Database, of 287 women treated with primary surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy for stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma, the median progression-free survival was 25.3 months, and the median overall survival was 97.8 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This compares favorably relative to overall survival in women with higher-grade carcinomas. For example in Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 218, women with stage III to IV disease experienced an overall survival of approximately 39 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a multivariable analysis of the MD Anderson database study, factors significantly associated with lower risk of progression were age (age &gt;35 years compared with age &lt;35 years), primary site (peritoneal compared with ovarian), and disease status at completion of chemotherapy (no disease compared with persistent disease). Factors associated with a better overall survival were site (peritoneal compared with ovarian), disease status at completion of chemotherapy (no disease compared with persistent disease), and age (&gt;35 years compared with &lt;35 years). In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that women with low-grade serous carcinoma whose tumors have a mutation in the MAP kinase pathway have a better prognosis than those whose tumors have no mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3016568838\"><span class=\"h1\">INVESTIGATIONAL APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been well established that low-grade serous carcinoma harbors a number of aberrations in genes that activate the MAP kinase pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This is in contrast to high-grade serous ovarian cancer and likely represents a &quot;driver&quot; event for low-grade tumors. Multiple pharmaceutical agents have been developed to target this pathway, and testing their use in this subtype has been an obvious strategy. </p><p>In a phase II study of 52 women with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma treated with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib, 15 percent had an objective response to therapy, and another 65 percent had stable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-grade-serous-carcinomas-of-the-ovary/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The most common epithelial ovarian cancer histologic subtype is serous. Approximately 90 percent of serous carcinomas are high-grade, and 10 percent are low-grade. (See <a href=\"#H2934691970\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On average, women with low-grade serous carcinoma are younger than those with ovarian cancer of all types, with a median age at diagnosis of 43 to 46.5 years of age. Approximately 90 percent of low-grade serous carcinoma present with disseminated disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage II to IV). (See <a href=\"#H322177224\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma is based on histologic evaluation of the ovary(ies) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsies of the peritoneum. Low-grade serous carcinoma is characterized by mild to moderate nuclear atypia as a primary feature and up to 12 mitoses per 10 high powered fields (HPF) as a secondary feature. By comparison, high-grade serous carcinoma is characterized by marked nuclear atypia and &gt;12 mitoses per 10 HPF. (See <a href=\"#H1758553858\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative management of low-grade serous carcinoma is essentially identical to that for all types of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum. In the process of the preoperative evaluation, based on findings, a determination should be made as to whether to recommend primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on several factors, including age, comorbidities, serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 level, and extent of disease based on imaging. (See <a href=\"#H3828770749\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With rare exceptions, primary surgery is the recommended approach for the optimal treatment of low-grade serous carcinoma. There are no distinguishing factors between low-grade serous carcinoma and other histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer in terms of surgical management. (See <a href=\"#H3316126516\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients in whom initial surgical resection is not appropriate (eg, multiple hepatic or other visceral metastases, or comorbidities), an attempt with primary systemic therapy is appropriate. In such cases, we re-image after three cycles to identify patients who can proceed with interval cytoreductive surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those undergoing surgery, the approach to adjuvant treatment depends on the stage of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H3665725045\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Because stage I low-grade serous carcinoma is extremely rare, no definitive information exists regarding standard adjuvant therapy. For those with stage IA and IB disease, we suggest observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For stage IC disease, there is no widely accepted standard approach. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines list a series of options, including observation, <span class=\"nowrap\">taxane/platinum</span> chemotherapy for three to six cycles, or hormonal therapy. Decisions should be individualized based on patient and provider preferences. (See <a href=\"#H44954731\" class=\"local\">'Stage IA, IB, and IC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with stage II to IV disease who have undergone surgery, adjuvant systemic therapy consists of a <span class=\"nowrap\">taxane/platinum</span> regimen, typically for six cycles. Unlike treatment of higher-grade ovarian cancer, there are no known benefits to intraperitoneal chemotherapy or dose-dense <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a></span> chemotherapy over standard chemotherapy, as trials have not provided enough information specifically for low-grade serous carcinoma to support these approaches. (See <a href=\"#H2904249352\" class=\"local\">'Stage II to IV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several options exist for women with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum. These include possible secondary cytoreductive surgery, chemotherapy (using standard definitions for either platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant disease), hormonal therapies, or targeted agents. (See <a href=\"#H653414814\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent or metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade serous carcinoma harbors a number of aberrations in genes that activate the MAP kinase pathway. Multiple pharmaceutical agents have been developed to target this pathway, and testing their use in this subtype is a strategy under investigation.
