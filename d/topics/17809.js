In children, the most common abnormality requiring fluid therapy is hypovolemia or dehydration, often related to vomiting and diarrhea from gastroenteritis. Clinically, it is useful to divide fluid therapy into repletion therapy and maintenance therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repletion therapy replaces any current existing water and electrolyte deficits, replaces any ongoing abnormal losses, and returns the patient to a normal volume and electrolyte status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance therapy replaces the expected ongoing losses of water and electrolytes from normal physiologic processes and maintains normal volume and electrolyte status (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-maintenance-fluid-calculation-for-children\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).

If severe hypovolemia is not corrected in a timely fashion, ischemic end-organ damage may occur and, with profound or persistent hypovolemia, shock and death may ensue.</p><p>The treatment of hypovolemia in children will be reviewed here. The clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia, and the treatment of hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic hypovolemic shock are discussed separately.

The second step can be completed either intravenously or by ORT.</p><p/><p>When repleting a hypovolemic child, several questions must be answered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the child require emergent therapy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By what route (oral or intravenous) should the fluid be delivered?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What kind of fluid should be given?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What fluid volume should be given initially and then in follow-up?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How quickly should the fluid in each step be given?</p><p/><p>Once the child has been repleted, ongoing maintenance fluid is need to replace ongoing losses of water and electrolytes, which is discussed separately.

Clinical assessment of hypovolemia is based upon physical signs that reflect the status of the effective arterial blood volume and include pulse, blood pressure, and skin turgor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76198\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198 \">table 1</a>). If known, changes in weight and urine output from baseline values are also helpful in assessing the degree of volume depletion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2997285656\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe hypovolemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe hypovolemia (defined as volume depletion &ge;10 percent)presents with decreased peripheral perfusion with a capillary refill of greater than three seconds, cool and mottled extremities, lethargy, and, in its worst manifestation, with hypotension or even frank shock (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76198\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198 \">table 1</a>).

The child should be reassessed during and after the saline bolus, and similar isotonic fluid infusions should be repeated as needed until adequate perfusion is restored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In most cases, a bolus of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> is given over 30 to 60 minutes with reassessment to decide on administration of a repeat intravenous bolus versus transition to oral therapy. In some cases, initial oral rehydration therapy may be sufficient to correct moderate dehydration and no emergent repletion therapy is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H3249524179\" class=\"local\">'Oral rehydration therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In a Canadian trial of 226 children with hypovolemia due to gastroenteritis, there was no difference in the status of hydration two hours after initial intervention between patients who were rapidly rehydrated (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> versus those who were treated with the standard 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Both groups received 0.9 percent saline. However, a major limitation of this study was the inconsistent and imprecise assessment of hydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, patients with mild hypovolemia who may not even require intravenous rehydration may have been included, which may have led to a biased outcome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isotonic crystalloid is recommended for emergent volume resuscitation in pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Isotonic saline (0.9 percent saline solution or normal saline) is the isotonic solution of choice to restore the circulatory volume. Rapid administration of hypotonic or hypertonic crystalloid solutions for emergent volume expansion can result in serious complications, including dysnatremias, cerebral edema, and, in children with marked hyponatremia, cerebral demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Therapy according to serum sodium'</a> below.) </p><p>The use of hypotonic or hypertonic crystalloid solutions for the purpose of emergent volume resuscitation is <strong>never</strong> recommended in pediatric patients.</p><p>Dextrose is generally not added to normal saline solution. In a clinical trial of 188 children (age range six months to six years), the administration of 5 percent dextrose added to normal saline solution did not lower the rate of hospitalization compared with the standard use of normal saline solution without dextrose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Children who received the dextrose-containing solution had a greater reduction in serum ketone levels, though these levels were still markedly abnormal and there was no difference between the two groups in degree of metabolic acidosis. Until further studies show that the addition of dextrose provides a significant clinical benefit without adverse effect, normal saline without dextrose is the recommended solution for emergent volume resuscitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Crystalloid versus colloid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although isotonic saline-based crystalloid solutions and colloid-containing solutions have been used historically to replace extracellular fluid deficits, isotonic crystalloid solution (ie, isotonic saline) is preferred. Some clinicians have advocated the administration of a colloid-containing solution (such as 5 percent albumin or hydroxyethyl starch [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hetastarch-hydroxyethyl-starch-450-0-7-hespan-hextend-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hetastarch</a>]) because of two theoretical advantages over crystalloid repletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma volume expansion is achieved more rapidly because more of the colloid solution remains in the vascular space, as opposed to saline, two-thirds of which equilibrates into the interstitium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk of pulmonary edema is decreased because diminished intravascular oncotic pressure from dilutional hypoalbuminemia will not occur.</p><p/><p>However, numerous controlled trials and systematic meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate either of these theoretical benefits in adults. Although no such data are available in children other than high-risk neonates, the same principles probably apply throughout childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. As a result, an isotonic saline solution is the treatment of choice in treating extracellular fluid losses in all age groups. Possible mechanisms for lack of benefit are discussed elsewhere.

In these specific settings, salt-poor albumin is administered at a dose between 0.5 and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> and is discussed separately.

In a meta-analysis that compared ORT with traditional intravenous (IV) rehydration, the overall failure rate with ORT (defined as the need to revert to IV therapy) was only 3.6 percent, without an increased incidence of iatrogenic hyponatremia or hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>ORT involves the administration of frequent small amounts of fluid by spoon or syringe.

However, when hypovolemia is associated with significant hyponatremia or hypernatremia, or when hypovolemia and associated alterations in serum sodium have evolved slowly, attention also must be paid to the rate of correction of the serum sodium concentration to avoid excessive shifts of water out of (hyponatremia) or into (hypernatremia) the brain that can lead to serious neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The water deficit is best estimated from the fall in body weight from baseline, which is usually not exactly known. The sodium deficit is equal to the deficit per liter in serum sodium (SNa) multiplied by the volume of distribution of the osmotic effect of sodium, which is the total body water (TBW):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Na deficit = [TBW(n) x 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L]</span> - [TBW(c) x SNa]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">where TBW(n) is the normal TBW and TBW(c) is the estimated current TBW.</p><p/><p>The TBW in most children is approximately 60 percent of body weight.

The TBW(c) would be the difference between TBW(n) and the fluid loss.

Some or most of the free water in these solutions cannot be excreted because hypovolemia also enhances the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), thereby increasing renal water reabsorption. In addition, ADH secretion due to other nonosmotic stimuli including pain, nausea and vomiting, stress, and hypoglycemia can be seen in children with hyponatremia and gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-children#H952883049\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in children&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Most affected children have mild to moderate hyponatremia (defined as serum sodium &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and asymptomatic) and can be treated with isotonic saline alone, similar to therapy for isonatremia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-children#H952883121\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>). Isotonic saline will correct the volume depletion and raise the serum sodium at the same time. The increase in serum sodium will occur in two stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum sodium will rise because the sodium concentration in the infused isotonic saline (154 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> is higher than that in the extracellular fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This will be followed by a further increase in serum sodium, as volume repletion will remove the hypovolemic stimulus to the secretion of ADH, thereby allowing urinary excretion of the excess water.</p><p/><p>Another factor that can promote correction of the hyponatremia is the administration of potassium. Potassium is the major intracellular solute and is as osmotically active as sodium. Thus, in a hypovolemic patient who also is hypokalemic, the addition of 40 mEq of potassium into each liter of isotonic saline creates a slightly hypertonic solution that will raise the serum sodium more rapidly than isotonic saline alone. Potassium, however, should not be added to intravenous fluids in patients with oliguria, anuria, or significantly diminished renal function. Potassium can be added with the establishment of good urinary flow, adequate renal function, and ability to closely monitor serum potassium concentration.

This adverse response to therapy primarily occurs when the hypernatremia is corrected too rapidly at a rate exceeding 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The overall fluid deficit in hypernatremic hypovolemia is a combination of the free water deficit that raised the serum sodium and an isotonic fluid deficit from the abnormal volume losses (which may be large in children with gastroenteritis and minimal in children with diabetes insipidus who have mainly free water loss).</p><p>Estimation of the free water deficit (essentially the amount of free water that would have to be lost to produce the observed elevation in serum sodium) is based upon the serum sodium and the estimated current TBW (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;, section on 'Derivation of the water deficit formula'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free water deficit = Current TBW <span class=\"nowrap\">[(SNa/140)</span> - 1]</p><p/><p>Suppose, for example, a 10 kg child (TBW 0.6 times body weight) has a 1 L fluid loss and a serum sodium concentration of 156 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The water deficit is replaced over more than 36 hours so that the serum sodium would be lowered at a rate below 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour. The serum sodium concentration must be monitored to ensure that the actual decrease is consistent with the therapeutic plan.

Maintenance fluid rates, again using isotonic saline, would be initiated when the patient became euvolemic.</p><p>This approach was suggested to prevent hospital-acquired hyponatremia associated with the administration of intravenous hypotonic fluids in the setting of significant ADH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Such hyponatremia occurs when hypotonic fluid is administered in the presence of ADH, which is released in response to nonosmotic stimuli such as significant hypovolemia, pain, or anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this clinical setting, the use of isotonic saline would prevent the development of hyponatremia. Administration of isotonic saline also simplifies the treatment regimen by eliminating the need to calculate sodium and water losses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study of children admitted with hypovolemia caused by gastroenteritis, patients were assigned randomly to receive either hypotonic or isotonic intravenous fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The administration of hypotonic solution (0.45 percent saline) did not alter the mean sodium level of children who were hyponatremic (from 132 to 133 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> but decreased the mean sodium level of children who were initially normonatremic (from 137 to 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. The use of isotonic solution increased mean serum sodium levels of initial hyponatremic patients (from 132 to 134 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> but there was no change in mean sodium levels in the initial normonatremic patients (from 137 to 138 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. The degree of hypovolemia was not assessed at the time of admission nor was a standardized infusion protocol used, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the full ramifications of this study. Moreover, the clinical significance of these small changes in sodium in normonatremic children is unclear.</p><p>Nonetheless, the use of isotonic saline infusions as the basis for fluid therapy has been recommended as a safe and effective option for hospitalized children with hypovolemia from gastroenteritis. Such an approach should not be used to formulate therapy in children with hypernatremia who need free water replacement or in those with other significant electrolyte abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
