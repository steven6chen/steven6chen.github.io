Sometimes, a fast heartbeat is a normal response to exercising or feeling very worried. But other times, a fast heartbeat is a sign of another problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515890\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes tachycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercising or feeling worried, stressed, or afraid can all cause tachycardia.</p><p>Other things that can cause tachycardia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having too many drinks with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or soda</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking or using chewing tobacco</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking certain illegal drugs, such as cocaine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a fever</p><p/><p>Problems with your heart's electrical system can also cause tachycardia. Some people are born with these problems. Other people get them because of high blood pressure, a heart attack, or other heart problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515907\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tachycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with tachycardia have no symptoms. But they might notice that their heart is beating fast, beating hard, or seems to skip a beat. These kinds of heartbeat changes are called &quot;palpitations.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes, a fast heartbeat makes it harder for your heart to pump blood to your body. This can cause symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515922\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for tachycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will probably do a test called an electrocardiogram. This test, also known as an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG,&quot; measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>You might also need other tests to see if another condition is causing your fast heartbeat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515937\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>If you do not have these problems, but you often feel your heart beating fast or irregularly, talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515952\"><span class=\"h1\">How is tachycardia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the cause of the tachycardia. When your heartbeat is very fast, your doctor might suggest ways to slow it down. He or she might have you cough, or bear down as if you're having a bowel movement. He or she might also put an ice pack on your face. Doing these things can affect the nerve that helps control your heartbeat.</p><p>Other treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control the speed or rhythm of your heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment called &quot;cardioversion&quot; that involves applying a mild electrical current to the heart to fix its rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called an &quot;implantable cardioverter defibrillator&quot; (&quot;ICD&quot; for short) that the doctor can put in your body. The ICD can help make your heart rhythm normal using mild electrical currents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called a pacemaker that the doctor can put in your body. The pacemaker sends electrical signals to your heart to control your heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments called &quot;ablation.&quot; Ablation treatments use heat (called &quot;radiofrequency ablation&quot;) or cold (called &quot;cryoablation&quot;) to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending the abnormal electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to create scar tissue in the heart. This will block the flow of the electrical signals that make your heart beat abnormal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515967\"><span class=\"h1\">Can tachycardia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If drinking too much caffeine or smoking caused your tachycardia, stopping those habits can prevent the problem.</p><p>Heart disease can increase your chance of having tachycardia. Doing things that keep your heart healthy can help. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating lots of fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, but not a lot of meat or fatty foods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking or doing a physical activity on most days of the week.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515982\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sick sinus syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers-and-their-responses-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vagal maneuvers and their responses (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
