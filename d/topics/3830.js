Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (formerly known as chronic necrotizing aspergillosis) is on the spectrum between chronic and acute forms of pulmonary aspergillosis (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> below). A duration of disease longer than three months distinguishes chronic pulmonary aspergillosis from acute and subacute pulmonary aspergillosis.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis will be reviewed here. The treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis as well as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and invasive aspergillosis is discussed separately.

However, the terminology that has been developed can be difficult to apply to a spectrum of disease entities that have considerable overlap and variation in severity. The following terminology will be used to describe the spectrum of disease; each entity is characterized by specific radiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspergilloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An aspergilloma is a fungus ball composed of <em>Aspergillus </em>hyphae, fibrin, mucus, and cellular debris found within a pulmonary cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Aspergillomas arise in preexisting pulmonary cavities that have become colonized with <em>Aspergillus </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>If the aspergilloma is single, the cavity stable over months, and the patient has few symptoms (ie, a mild cough only) and little evidence of systemic inflammation, a simple aspergilloma may be diagnosed. We will use the term &quot;simple aspergilloma&quot; to distinguish this entity from the more complex forms of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34802679\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspergillus nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Aspergillus </em>nodules occur in immunocompetent hosts, may be single or multiple, and may or may not have cavitation within them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The differential diagnosis includes carcinoma of the lung and coccidioidal or other fungal nodules. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but some have a new minor pulmonary symptom such as cough, an incidental chest infection, or an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, <em>Aspergillus </em>nodules are fluorodeoxyglucose avid to variable degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and are usually accompanied by a positive <em>Aspergillus </em>immunoglobulin (Ig)G titer in the blood. On histopathology, necrosis is surrounded by granulomatous inflammation with occasional multinucleate giant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This term is preferred over the older term &quot;complex aspergilloma&quot; because more than 50 percent of such patients don't have an aspergilloma visible radiographically. Almost all patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis have <em>Aspergillus </em>IgG antibodies in the blood. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis is a late-stage manifestation of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis in which progression to marked and extensive fibrosis has occurred, sometimes called &quot;destroyed lung&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with some degree of immunocompromise who present with progressive features over one to three months have subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (formerly known as chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis). This manifestation typically occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, alcoholism, advanced age, prolonged glucocorticoid use or other modestly immunosuppressive agents, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, connective disease, radiation therapy, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hyphal invasion of tissue is observed histologically or can be inferred based upon radiographic findings, including cavitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such patients usually have a single thin-walled cavity or area of cavitating <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumonia/consolidation</span> and may have detectable <em>Aspergillus </em>antigen (galactomannan) or <em>Aspergillus </em>IgG antibodies in blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis remains incompletely understood. Although patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis are generally immunocompetent, all patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis have either prior pulmonary damage or disease. Aspergillomas usually always arise in preexisting cavities in the lungs. Increasing evidence supports major and complex genetic factors in patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, consistent with an inability to control <em>Aspergillus</em> in the lung, and subsequent persistent inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mycology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis are caused by <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, although patients have been described with <em>A. niger </em>or <em>A. flavus </em>infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Occasionally, <em>A. fumigatus </em>isolates may be atypical, growing slowly with poor sporulation, delaying identification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Underlying diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common underlying diseases that predispose patients to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis include pulmonary tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, asthma (usually treated by courses of glucocorticoids), lung cancer (following successful treatment), prior pneumothorax with associated bulla formation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and fibrocavitary sarcoidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67910 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Rarer causes include rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, silicosis, pneumoconiosis, and hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis can also evolve from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis that has not completely resolved.</p><p>Patients with classical pulmonary tuberculosis who are left with cavities of &ge;2 cm have an approximately 20 percent chance of subsequently developing aspergillomas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic pulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In a study that used modeling to estimate the global burden of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis as a sequela of pulmonary tuberculosis, the prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis varied widely, with a lower prevalence in developed countries than in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The estimated country prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis ranged from &lt;1 case per 100,000 population in large western European countries and the United States to 42.9 per 100,000 population in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. China and India had intermediate prevalence rates of 16.2 and 23.1 per 100,000 population, respectively, reflecting the variable frequency of pulmonary tuberculosis. Overall, an estimated 1.2 million people have chronic pulmonary aspergillosis following pulmonary tuberculosis, of whom approximately 300,000 live in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with a history of pulmonary infection caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria, such as <em>M. xenopi</em>, <em>M. malmoense</em>, or <em>M. avium complex</em>, may have a higher rate of subsequent chronic pulmonary aspergillosis when compared with patients with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Unlike the other forms of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis often occurs in immunocompromised patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and individuals receiving glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Role of glucocorticoids'</a> below). In contrast, invasive aspergillosis occurs most commonly in profoundly immunocompromised patients, such as neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies, and transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis appear to have genetic defects in one or more innate immune functions, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, interleukin 15, TLR3, TLR10, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), <em>DENND1B </em>(a gene expressed by natural killer cells and dendritic cells), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plasminogen activator gene (PLAT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The interrelationship of these defects with disease expression is complex. For example, in one study, higher mannose-binding lectin (MBL) levels were linked with increased breathlessness in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], whereas prior small studies had suggested an association with low MBL levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Cytokine production profiles are most consistent with a Th2 profile in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Macrophages from patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis produce large amounts of the neutrophil chemoattractant pro-platelet basic protein (CXCL7), suggesting low interleukin 10 levels or activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mannose-binding lectin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis frequently have poor antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Many have a diminished interferon-gamma response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical failure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids given without antifungal therapy in patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis may accelerate lung destruction, especially in patients with sarcoidosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Presumably, cavities expand because the <em>Aspergillus </em>growing on the interior surface of the cavity secretes proteins (eg, proteases, phospholipases, catalases, and others) or secondary metabolic products (eg, gliotoxin), which lead to ongoing inflammation and progressive localized lung tissue damage. It is not clear why new cavities form without tissue invasion being demonstrable, why fungal balls are present in some cavities and not others, and why abnormal bronchial arterial vasculature forms, resulting in hemoptysis. Glucocorticoids may be helpful in resolving inflammation in those receiving adequate antifungal therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspergillomas in the lung are rounded conglomerates of hyphae, mucus, and cellular debris that may be loosely attached to the wall of a pulmonary cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. On histologic section, a pulmonary aspergilloma has a lamellar appearance due to the accumulation of sequential layers of fungal hyphae combined with fungal extracellular matrix that have grown on the interior surface of the cavity and sloughed off. Oxalate crystals may be visible in tissue, especially in patients with <em>A. niger </em>infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis is characterized pathologically by chronic inflammation with localized fibrosis, usually without granulomas, necrosis, or eosinophilic infiltrates. Cavity walls may be composed of three layers: necrotic, granulation, and fibrotic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Hyphae do not invade tissue unless the patient becomes immunocompromised, when localized invasive disease supervenes. The distinction between chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis and subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is particularly difficult in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving modest doses of immunosuppressants.</p><p>Chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis is characterized by extensive fibrosis and some chronic inflammation distant from a cavity and involving large sections of lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis vary in age from 20 to over 80 years old but are typically in their middle years. In a series of 18 patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, the median age was 59 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The cavitary and fibrosing forms of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis usually progress slowly over months or years, but the subacute invasive form usually progresses more rapidly over weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis present most commonly with a several month history of weight loss, chronic productive cough, hemoptysis of variable severity, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortness of breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,26</a>]. Fever and night sweats occur occasionally. The systemic symptoms of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis are an important point of distinction from a simple aspergilloma, in which these do not occur.</p><p>In a series of 18 patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, the various signs and symptoms were present with the following frequencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; 17 patients (94 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough, which is usually productive &ndash; 14 patients (78 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath &ndash; 9 patients (50 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoptysis &ndash; 10 patients (58 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate to severe <span class=\"nowrap\">fatigue/malaise</span> &ndash; 5 patients (28 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &ndash; 3 patients (17 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substantial sputum production &ndash; 2 patients (11 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; 2 patients (11 percent) </p><p/><p>It is likely that the patients with fever had subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or a coexistent bacterial infection, as patients with the other forms of chronic aspergillosis rarely have fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic examination usually reveals one or more cavities, typically within the upper lobes, which may or may not contain fungus balls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54038 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65409\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65409 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77208\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77208 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56179\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56179 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27</a>].</p><p>A simple aspergilloma is a fungus ball in a single pulmonary cavity with limited surrounding inflammation, pleural thickening, or fibrosis. The radiographic appearance remains stable over several months, unlike in chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, in which cavities may expand or coalesce. It develops from detachment of layers of growth of fungus on the inner cavity wall over weeks or months, with several intermediate appearances before being seen as a typical fungal ball [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis usually begins as ill-defined regions of consolidation that progress to form clearly defined cavities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cavities may contain fungus balls, debris, or fluid. There are often multiple cavities of different sizes. It is most common for the cavities to be thin-walled and to lack associated pleural thickening, although both thick cavity walls and pleural thickening occur in some cases. If pericavitary infiltrates and pleural thickening adjacent to cavities are present, they generally improve very slowly with appropriate therapy, leaving residual thin-walled empty cavities. New cavity formation or expansion of one or more existing cavities over time is highly characteristic and typically occurs over months in the absence of treatment.</p><p>Single or multiple nodules are also seen in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They are not usually spiculated and are therefore not typical of lung carcinoma; nevertheless, carcinoma should always be considered in the differential diagnosis. These may or may not cavitate, forming a small air crescent, and may develop into larger cavities over time. Such nodules have been noted to be moderately or strongly positive on positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, mimicking carcinoma of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis is characterized by the same radiographic findings that occur with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis in combination with significant fibrosis.</p><p>In contrast with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, thin-walled cavities or consolidation with cavitation associated with subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis usually worsen over weeks to a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis can be inferred from a single chest radiograph, detailed and sequentially acquired radiographic data may be required to observe both the typical radiographic features and the very slow progression (over months or years) that is characteristic of the cavitary and fibrotic forms of this disease. Computed tomography (CT) scans are useful to define the precise pattern and extent of involvement. PET scans are usually positive at varying levels of intensity but do not discriminate between different causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>].</p><p>Serial imaging is useful not only for following the progression of disease prior to starting therapy but also for evaluating the response to therapy, although it improves very slowly.

Most patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, including those with simple aspergillomas and <em>Aspergillus </em>nodules, have positive <em>Aspergillus </em>IgG antibodies in the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. Patients with a negative test but highly suspicious findings should have an alternative <em>Aspergillus</em> IgG test performed.

Atypical mycobacterial disease can precede, occur concurrently, or follow chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Concurrent bacterial infection (often an exacerbation of bronchiectasis) is common and occasionally occurs in a cavity, resulting in a fluid level.

Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (formerly known as chronic necrotizing aspergillosis) is on the spectrum between chronic and acute forms of pulmonary aspergillosis. A duration of disease longer than three months distinguishes chronic pulmonary aspergillosis from acute and subacute pulmonary aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis are caused by <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, although patients have been described with <em>A. niger</em> or <em>A. flavus</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Mycology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis have either prior pulmonary damage or disease. The most common underlying diseases that predispose patients to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis include pulmonary tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, lung cancer (following successful treatment), prior pneumothorax with associated bulla formation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and fibrocavitary sarcoidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67910 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Underlying diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis have genetic defects in one or more innate immune functions and have a diminished interferon-gamma response. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis present most commonly with weight loss, chronic productive cough, hemoptysis of variable severity, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortness of breath. Fever and night sweats occur occasionally. The systemic symptoms of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis are an important point of distinction from a simple aspergilloma, in which these do not occur. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic examination usually reveals one or more cavities, typically within the upper lobes, which may or may not contain fungus balls. New cavity formation or expansion of one or more existing cavities over time is highly characteristic of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cardinal test for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is a positive <em>Aspergillus </em>immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody test from the serum. Serum galactomannan is usually negative, and 1,3-betaD-glucan is often positive. However, standardization of this testing is not well established for this indication. A minority of patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis has positive cultures of <em>A. fumigatus </em>(or rarely other <em>Aspergillus </em>species) in their sputum, but <em>Aspergillus </em>polymerase chain reaction from the sputum is usually positive. More than 50 percent of patients have positive <em>Aspergillus </em>IgE tests, and some have slightly elevated total serum IgE levels without having allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are very common in patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis but are not specific.
