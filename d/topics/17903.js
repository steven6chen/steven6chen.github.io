Most cases are not severe enough to affect general health and are treated in the outpatient setting. Rare life-threatening presentations can occur that require intensive inpatient management.</p><p>This topic reviews the treatment of psoriatic skin disease. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriatic skin disease are discussed in detail separately, as are psoriatic arthritis and the management of psoriasis in pregnant women, children, and special populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-psoriasis-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of psoriasis in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-in-children-management-of-chronic-plaque-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoriasis in children: Management of chronic plaque psoriasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment selection for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in special populations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriasis is a chronic disease that can have a significant effect on quality of life. Therefore, management of psoriasis involves addressing both psychosocial and physical aspects of the disease. </p><p>Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference (including cost and convenience), efficacy, and evaluation of individual patient response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although medication safety plays an important role in treatment selection, this must be balanced by the risk of undertreatment of psoriasis, leading to inadequate clinical improvement and patient dissatisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriasis can be a frustrating disease for the patient and the provider. The clinician needs to be empathetic and spend adequate time with the patient. It may be helpful for the clinician to touch the patient when appropriate to communicate physically that the skin disorder is neither repulsive nor contagious.</p><p>Clinicians should lay out reasonable aims of treatment, making it clear to the patient that the primary goal of treatment is control of the disease. Although treatment can provide patients with high degrees of disease improvement, there is no cure for psoriasis.</p><p>Educating the patient about psoriasis is important and referral to an organization such as the National Psoriasis Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.psoriasis.org/&amp;token=2Y5gFuee09EFBxWe2RsiKNGQWjTlOmNmxrmsudOjBIm/YHv2c3WriO+y/lt6H9DG&amp;TOPIC_ID=5666\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.psoriasis.org</a>) is often helpful.</p><p>Psoriasis may affect patients' perceptions of themselves and this can potentially initiate or exacerbate psychological disorders such as depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Patients with limited skin disease may still have significant psychosocial disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some patients with psoriasis may benefit from counseling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment with psychoactive medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients, the initial decision point around therapy will be between topical and systemic therapy. However, even patients on systemic therapy will likely continue to need some topical agents. Topical therapy may provide symptomatic relief, minimize required doses of systemic medications, and may even be psychologically cathartic for some patients.</p><p>For purposes of treatment planning, patients may be grouped into mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe disease categories. Limited, or mild-to-moderate, skin disease can often be managed with topical agents, while patients with moderate-to-severe disease may need phototherapy or systemic therapy. The location of the disease and the presence of psoriatic arthritis also affect the choice of therapy. Psoriasis of the hand, foot, or face can be debilitating functionally or socially and may deserve a more aggressive treatment approach. The treatment of psoriatic arthritis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Moderate-to-severe psoriasis is typically defined as involvement of more than 5 to 10 percent of the body surface area (the entire palmar surface, including fingers, of one hand is approximately 1 percent of the body surface area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]) or involvement of the face, palm or sole, or disease that is otherwise disabling. Patients with more than 5 to 10 percent body surface area affected are generally candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, since application of topical agents to a large area is not usually practical or acceptable for most patients. Attempts to treat extensive disease with topical agents are often met with failure, can add cost, and lead to frustration in the patient-clinician relationship.</p><p>There is ample evidence of efficacy of the newer systemic therapies (&quot;biologics&quot;); however, cost is a major consideration with these agents. Established therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and phototherapy continue to play a role in the management of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Biologic agents'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of patients with extensive or recalcitrant disease is a challenge even for experienced dermatologists. However, the availability of biologic medications has reduced the challenge considerably. </p><p>The concept that many patients with psoriasis in the United States do not receive sufficient treatment to control the disease is suggested by an analysis of surveys performed by the National Psoriasis Foundation between 2003 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among the 5604 survey respondents with psoriasis, 52 percent expressed dissatisfaction with their treatment. Many patients received no treatment, including 37 to 49 percent of respondents with mild psoriasis, 24 to 36 percent of respondents with moderate psoriasis, and 9 to 30 percent of respondents with severe psoriasis. Further studies will be useful for clarifying the reasons for these observations and for determining the value of interventions to increase the accessibility of treatment.</p><p>Widespread pustular disease requires aggressive treatment, which may include hospitalization. Therapeutic approaches to generalized pustular psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild-to-moderate disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited plaque psoriasis responds well to topical corticosteroids and emollients. Alternatives include vitamin D analogs, such as calcipotriene and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>, tar, and topical retinoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tazarotene</a>). For facial or intertriginous areas, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a> may be used as alternatives or as corticosteroid sparing agents, though improvement may not be as rapid. Localized phototherapy is another option for recalcitrant disease.</p><p>Combinations of potent topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) and either calcipotriene, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tazarotene</a>, or UVB phototherapy are commonly prescribed by dermatologists. Calcipotriene in combination with Class I topical corticosteroids is highly effective for short-term control. Calcipotriene alone can then be used continuously and the combination with potent corticosteroids used intermittently (on weekends) for maintenance. A combination product containing calcipotriene and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate is available for this use. With proper adherence, considerable improvement with topical therapies may be seen in as little as one week, though several weeks may be required to demonstrate full benefits.</p><p>Because adherence to topical treatment can be a major hurdle, keeping the treatment regimen simple and using treatment vehicles that the patient finds acceptable is often beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe psoriasis requires phototherapy or systemic therapies such as retinoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apremilast</a>, or biologic immune modifying agents. Biologic agents used in the treatment of psoriasis include the anti-TNF agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, the anti-interleukin <span class=\"nowrap\">(IL)-12/23</span> antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, and the anti-IL-17 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a>. Improvement usually occurs within weeks. Patients with severe psoriasis generally require care by a dermatologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Intertriginous psoriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intertriginous (inverse) psoriasis should be treated with class VI and VII low potency corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) due to an increased risk of corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy in the intertriginous areas. Topical calcipotriene or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> and the topical calcineurin inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a> are additional first-line treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These agents may be used alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids as corticosteroid sparing agents for long term maintenance therapy. Calcipotriene, tacrolimus, and pimecrolimus are more expensive options than topical corticosteroids. Some concerns have been raised about the safety of the calcineurin inhibitors (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Calcineurin inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis#H28373595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;, section on 'Inverse psoriasis'</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75409637\"><span class=\"h3\">Scalp psoriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of hair on the scalp can make topical treatment of psoriasis challenging because patients may find certain products messy or difficult to apply. Recognizing the patient's preference for a drug vehicle may help to improve adherence to therapy. For many patients, lotion, solution, gel, foam, or spray vehicles are preferable to thicker creams or ointments. </p><p>Topical corticosteroids are the primary topical agents used for psoriasis on the scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Support for the use of these agents is evident in a systematic review of randomized trials that found that very potent or potent topical corticosteroids are more effective treatments for scalp psoriasis than topical vitamin D analogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Combining a corticosteroid and vitamin D analog may offer additional benefit; in the systematic review, combination treatment with a potent topical corticosteroid and a vitamin D analog appeared slightly more effective than potent topical corticosteroid monotherapy. However, in clinical practice, complicating the treatment regimen with more than one topical product may reduce the likelihood of consistent adherence to the treatment regimen. Thus, we usually prescribe a topical corticosteroid alone as initial therapy. Commercial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate-calcipotriene combination products are available, but are more expensive than most topical corticosteroid preparations. </p><p>Other topical therapies used for psoriasis (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tazarotene</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coal-tar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">coal tar</a> shampoo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a>) and intralesional corticosteroid injections also may be beneficial for scalp involvement, though data on efficacy specifically in scalp disease are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Salicylic acid can be a helpful adjunctive treatment because of its keratolytic effect. Phototherapy (eg, excimer laser) and systemic agents are additional treatment options for patients who cannot achieve sufficient improvement with topical agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Guttate psoriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of guttate psoriasis is reviewed separately.

However, these drugs appear to be particularly effective in the treatment of pustular psoriasis, and we consider them first line therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acitretin</a> is the retinoid that is used most often for this indication. Acitretin is a potent teratogen and should not be used in women who might become pregnant. Pregnancy is contraindicated for three years following acitretin therapy.

Based upon data from open-label or retrospective studies and case reports, a panel of experts suggested that patients with severe, unstable disease should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> due to the rapid onset and high efficacy of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with less acute disease can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> as first-line agents.

Keeping psoriatic skin soft and moist minimizes the symptoms of itching and tenderness. Additionally, maintaining proper skin hydration can help prevent irritation and thus the potential for subsequent Koebnerization (development of new psoriatic lesions at sites of trauma).</p><p>The most effective are ointments such as petroleum jelly or thick creams, especially when applied immediately after a hydrating bath or shower.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids remain the mainstay of topical psoriasis treatment despite the development of newer agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The mechanism of action of corticosteroids in psoriasis is not fully understood. Corticosteroids exert antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and immunosuppressive actions by affecting gene transcription.</p><p>The inherent potency of a topical corticosteroid is frequently reported using a I to VII scale based on vasoconstrictive assays (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). Although ointments are sometimes thought to be inherently more effective because of their occlusive properties, this is not uniformly correct. In practice, the <span class=\"nowrap\">efficacy/potency</span> of a topical corticosteroid is dependent on many factors including skin type, plaque thickness, and, perhaps most importantly, compliance.</p><p>To minimize adverse effects and maximize compliance, the site of application needs to be considered in choosing the appropriately potent corticosteroid:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the scalp or in the external ear canal, potent corticosteroids in a solution or foam vehicle (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinonide</a> 0.05% or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05%) are frequently indicated. Clobetasol 0.05% shampoo or spray can also be used for scalp involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the face and intertriginous areas, a low potency cream (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 1%) is often sufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For thick plaques on extensor surfaces, potent preparations (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> 0.05% or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05%) are often required.</p><p/><p>The typical regimen consists of twice daily application of topical corticosteroids. Most patients will show a rapid decrease in inflammation with such therapy, but complete normalization of skin or lasting remission is unpredictable.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids generally can be continued as long as the patient has thick active lesions. Skin atrophy from topical corticosteroids usually is not a problem unless the medication is continuously applied after the skin has returned to normal thickness. Once clinical improvement occurs, the frequency of application should be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For patients in whom lesions recur quickly, topical corticosteroids can be applied intermittently (such as on weekends only) to maintain improvement. The addition of non-corticosteroid topical treatments can also facilitate the avoidance of long-term daily topical corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mild-to-moderate disease'</a> above.)</p><p>The risks of cutaneous and systemic side effects associated with chronic topical corticosteroid use are increased with high potency formulations. Data support limiting the continuous application of Class I topical corticosteroids to two to four weeks; thus, close clinician supervision should be employed if longer treatment durations are required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Data are less clear regarding treatment durations for less potent topical corticosteroids. Side effects of topical corticosteroids, including the potential for suppression of the hypothalamic axis, are discussed separately.

Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> ointment has been prescribed in Europe for years, and is now available in the United States. When compared with calcipotriene, calcitriol appears to induce less irritation in sensitive areas of the skin (eg, skin folds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcipotriene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcipotriene (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcipotriol-calcipotriene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcipotriol</a>) is an established therapy in psoriasis.

An immune modulating effect has been postulated for calcipotriene, but has not been shown to be significant in psoriasis to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, calcipotriene was at least as effective as potent topical corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>, short contact dithranol, tacalcitol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coal-tar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">coal tar</a> and combined coal tar 5%, allantoin 2%, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 0.5% [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Only potent topical corticosteroids appeared to have comparable efficacy at eight weeks. Skin irritation is the main adverse event associated with calcipotriene.</p><p>Combined use of calcipotriene and superpotent corticosteroids has demonstrated increased clinical response and tolerance in clinical trials compared with either agent used alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. One regimen employed daily use of both calcipotriene ointment and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=halobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">halobetasol</a> ointment for two weeks, followed by weekend use of the halobetasol ointment and weekday use of calcipotriene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This regimen produced six-month remission maintenance in 76 percent compared with 40 percent with weekend halobetasol alone. A similar regimen with calcipotriene ointment and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate foam also appears to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In addition, a randomized trial found that a preparation that combines calcipotriene with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate (0.064%) was effective with once daily usage, and more effective than once daily therapy with either betamethasone or calcipotriene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]; this combination preparation typically costs more than $400 for a 60 g tube. Patients who use topical corticosteroids in combination with calcipotriene must be monitored for adverse effects as with corticosteroid monotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, topical calcipotriene may be used as an alternative or adjunct to topical corticosteroid therapy. It is applied twice daily when used as monotherapy. No controlled trials guide how best to use topical corticosteroids in conjunction with calcipotriene. Once daily use of each may be adequate. Acidic products can inactivate topical calcipotriene, and some topical corticosteroids may be acidic. A reasonable approach to combination therapy is to have patients apply topical calcipotriene and topical corticosteroids each once daily at different times of day.</p><p>Other than skin irritation, side effects of topical calcipotriene are usually minimal; the risk of hypercalcemia is low when the drug is used appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

However, on sensitive areas of the skin, calcitriol appears to be less irritating than calcipotriene. An intraindividual randomized trial of 75 patients compared treatment with calcitriol 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> ointment to calcipotriene 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> ointment for mild to moderate psoriasis on facial, hairline, retroauricular, and flexural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Perilesional erythema, perilesional edema, and stinging or burning sensations were significantly lower in the areas treated with calcitriol. A 52-week open-label study of the safety of calcitriol ointment did not reveal an adverse effect on calcium homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Similar to calcipotriene, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> ointment is more expensive than many generic potent topical corticosteroids.

There are no commercially available <span class=\"nowrap\">corticosteroid/tar</span> combinations. Tar products are available without a prescription in the form of shampoos, creams, lotions, ointments, and oils. Newer products include a solution and a foam. Some patients may prefer the less messy formulations.</p><p>Tar can also be compounded into creams and ointments.

An alternative is 4 to 10% LCD (liquor carbonis detergens, a tar distillate) in triamcinolone cream or ointment, used similarly. A preparation of 1% tar in a fatty-acid based lotion may be superior to conventional 5% tar products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and appears to have efficacy similar to that of calcipotriene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Topical tar preparations, including shampoos, creams, and other preparations, can be used once daily. Patients should be warned that tar products have the potential to stain hair, skin, and clothing. It may help to use them at night and wear inexpensive night clothes (eg, old pajamas) as they tend to be messy. Patients may also find the odor of tar products unpleasant.</p><p>For shampoos, the emphasis should be on making sure the product reaches the scalp.

The 0.1% cream was somewhat more effective than 0.05% cream, but with a slightly higher rate of local side effects. Another study found that once daily administration of tazarotene gel, 0.05% or 0.1%, compared favorably with the twice daily administration of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinonide</a> 0.05% [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Absorption of tazarotene was minimal over the 12-week course of the study, suggesting that systemic toxicity is unlikely during long-term therapy. A small uncontrolled study of short contact tazarotene found that a 20 minute application followed by washing appeared to be less irritating than traditional use, and seemed to have similar efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The mechanism of action of anthralin in psoriasis is not well understood, but may involve antiinflammatory effects and normalization of keratinocyte differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Skin irritation is an expected side effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a> that can limit the use of this therapy. This side effect and the ability of anthralin to cause permanent red-brown stains on clothing and temporary staining of skin have contributed to a decline in the use of anthralin therapy.</p><p>In order to minimize irritation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a> treatment is usually prescribed as a short-contact regimen that is titrated according to patient tolerance.

Subsequently, the application time is titrated up to 20 to 30 minutes as tolerated.</p><p>Application to surrounding unaffected skin should be avoided to minimize irritation. For patients with well-defined plaques, petrolatum or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> may be applied to the surrounding skin as a protectant prior to application. After the desired contact period has elapsed, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a> should be washed off the treated area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a> therapy is often evident within the first few weeks of therapy.

As an example, patients often notice improvement in skin lesions during the summer months. UV radiation may act via antiproliferative effects (slowing keratinization) and anti-inflammatory effects (inducing apoptosis of pathogenic T-cells in psoriatic plaques). In choosing UV therapy, consideration must be given to the potential for UV radiation to accelerate photodamage and increase the risk of cutaneous malignancy.</p><p>Phototherapy and photochemotherapy require the supervision of a dermatologist trained in these treatment modalities. The American Academy of Dermatology has provided guidelines for the treatment of psoriasis with ultraviolet light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Despite high efficacy and safety, the use of office-based phototherapy has declined in the United States because of administrative issues and the development of new systemic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic doses of ultraviolet light can be administered in several ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (290 to 320 nm) is used in patients with extensive disease, alone or in combination with topical tar.

UVA penetrates deeper into the dermis than UVB and does not have the latter's potential for burning the skin. A number of possible mechanisms have been postulated to explain PUVA's effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. With oral PUVA, patients ingest the photosensitizing drug, 8-methoxypsoralen, followed within two hours by exposure to UVA; this sequence is performed three times weekly in increasing doses until remission, then twice or once weekly as a maintenance dose. With bath PUVA, the psoralen capsules are dissolved in water, and affected skin (hands, feet, or total body) is soaked for 15 to 30 minutes prior to UVA exposure. There are few data on the comparative efficacy of oral and bath PUVA for psoriasis. A small open randomized trial of 74 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis did not find a significant difference in efficacy between the two treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this finding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients take psoralen prior to coming into the office or clinic for PUVA. Increased photosensitivity is typically present starting one hour after an oral dose and resolves after eight hours. Pre and post treatment photoprotection (eg, hat, sunscreen, sun protective goggles) are critical in preventing serious burn injury to the skin and eyes from being outside.

This option may be preferred by patients who are not in close proximity to an office-based phototherapy center, whose schedules do not permit frequent office visits, or for whom the costs of in-office treatment exceed those of a home phototherapy unit.

As an example, one study of excimer laser therapy involved 124 patients with stable mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, of whom 80 completed the entire protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Treatments were scheduled twice weekly. After 10 or fewer treatments, 84 and 50 percent of patients achieved the outcomes of 75 percent or better and 90 percent or better clearing of plaques, respectively. This number of treatments was far fewer than that typically required of phototherapy (25 or more). Side effects of laser therapy included erythema and blistering; these were generally well tolerated, and no patient discontinued therapy because of adverse effects. </p><p>A common sequela of excimer laser therapy is the induction of UV-induced hyperpigmentation (tanning) in treated areas, which can be cosmetically distressing for some patients. Hyperpigmentation resolves after the discontinuation of treatment. </p><p>Like 311 nm UVB, the excimer laser represents a therapeutic advance toward specific wavelength therapies for psoriasis.
