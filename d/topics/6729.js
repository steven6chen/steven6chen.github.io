The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of hematopoietic cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients can develop bacterial, fungal, viral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasitic infections following HCT, particularly following allogeneic HCT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 1</a>). Infection in such patients is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, prevention of infection is a major goal involving determination of risk, careful selection of donors, infection control measures, and prophylactic and preemptive antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>This topic review will discuss appropriate pretransplantation screening tests.

We favor screening for TB with either one of these tests in all HCT candidates with risk factors for TB.

Accordingly, healthcare workers and visitors with symptoms of upper respiratory infection should be restricted from having contact with HCT candidates. The presence of a community respiratory virus infection in an HCT candidate is of particular concern because these viruses can progress to pneumonia following HCT. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, and metapneumovirus, can progress to pneumonia in HCT recipients.</p><p>Any HCT candidate with signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection should be tested promptly for the presence of community respiratory viruses. The optimal specimens for testing are nasopharyngeal aspirates, washings, and swabs. The optimal diagnostic test (viral culture, rapid antigen testing, fluorescent antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction) varies depending on the virus.

Even asymptomatic infections can evolve into overwhelming sepsis following transplantation. Similarly, donors with active infections should be treated prior to donating cells. Infections in the donor that are contraindications to stem cell donation are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H690852544\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to stem cell donation'</a> below.)</p><p>Decisions regarding the timing of HCT following initiation of therapy for infections in the HCT donor or candidate must be made on a case-by-case basis. Since many HCT candidates with malignant conditions have a high mortality rate if their underlying disease is not treated expeditiously with HCT, it may be appropriate to proceed to HCT even when the donor is known to have an infection that could be transmitted to the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risks and benefits of using potentially infected donor cells must be weighed carefully in this situation.</p><p>When HCT candidates have infections with pathogens that can be treated fully prior to HCT (eg, bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia), it is optimal to do so. In some cases, continuing treatment through the high-risk period is indicated. The decision of when it is safe to proceed to HCT must be made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28144115\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytomegalovirus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with profound T cell immunodeficiency have a higher risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, even prior to commencing the conditioning regimen. These patients should undergo testing with CMV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) two weeks prior to commencing the conditioning regimen and should receive anti-CMV therapy if found to have CMV viremia.</p><p>The development of CMV infection prior to allogeneic transplantation is associated with a high risk of death after HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Active CMV replication in a HCT recipient can portend particularly high risk for CMV disease when the patient is CMV seropositive and is transplanted from a donor who is CMV seronegative or with cord blood stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In these high-risk situations, it has been suggested that the patient be treated with an antiviral agent (eg, intravenous [IV] <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a>, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>) to prevent CMV disease, and the conditioning regimen should be delayed until the CMV infection is controlled (ie, until evidence of decline of CMV viral load in the absence of CMV disease). The conditioning regimen may then be started during antiviral therapy. However, ganciclovir or valganciclovir should be switched to foscarnet no longer than two days prior to starting the conditioning regimen to prevent the myelosuppressive effects of ganciclovir and valganciclovir. Foscarnet may be stopped if CMV PCR or antigenemia become undetectable and if there is no evidence of CMV disease. However, close monitoring should continue and foscarnet resumed at the first evidence of CMV reactivation or CMV disease. Prevention of CMV disease is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients#H1058289551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of viral infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'Cytomegalovirus'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a history of CMV disease (ie, pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease, and retinitis) within six months preceding HCT should be given IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> throughout the preengraftment period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82251534\"><span class=\"h2\">Community respiratory viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited information concerning whether HCT candidates with documented community respiratory viruses should have the transplant procedure delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. If possible, HCT candidates with upper respiratory tract symptoms at the time that the conditioning regimen is due to begin should postpone the conditioning regimen until the illness has resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This recommendation is supported by a prospective study in which pre-HCT and weekly post-HCT nasal washes were obtained through day 100 following HCT from patients with or without symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, donation is not strictly contraindicated since viral transmission is not universal and the recipient can receive antiviral prophylaxis. Hepatitis C&ndash;infected HCT candidates for whom there is no alternative donor can receive a transplant from a hepatitis C&ndash;positive donor provided that they understand the risk involved. When possible, hepatitis B&ndash; or C&ndash;infected donors can be treated with antivirals to reduce the transmission risk. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients#H357743305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of viral infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'Hepatitis viruses'</a>.)</p><p>Donors who have traveled to a malaria-endemic area should defer donation for one year following their return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Former or current residents of endemic areas should defer donation for three years. If this is not feasible, the donor should be treated empirically for malaria prior to donation. If the donor is diagnosed with active malaria, collection of stem cells should be delayed if possible until treatment has been completed and negative confirmatory testing obtained. If this is not feasible, preemptive treatment of the HCT recipient is reasonable, although there is no evidence regarding the safety or efficacy of this approach.</p><p>Blood banking standards recommend deferral for a past history of Q fever or babesiosis because these infections can be chronic and <em>Babesia</em> parasites might persist despite appropriate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based upon these concerns, we also suggest the avoidance of stem cell donation from individuals with a history of Q fever or babesiosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498083722\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following transplantation, HCT recipients typically lose immunity to pathogens against which they were previously immunized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91882 \">table 2</a>). Thus, HCT recipients should be immunized against a number of pathogens following the return of immune competence. Other strategies for preventing infections in HCT recipients include pretransplant vaccination of HCT candidates with the usual vaccines that are indicated based upon age, vaccination history, and exposure history; and vaccination of household contacts. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73970612\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infusion of hematopoietic cells to reestablish marrow function in an individual who has had his or her bone marrow ablated with chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation has become standard therapy for many malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Patients can develop bacterial, fungal, viral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasitic infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 1</a>). Infection in such patients is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, prevention of infection is a major goal involving determination of risk, careful selection of donors, infection control measures, and prophylactic and preemptive antimicrobial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretransplantation evaluation is designed to prevent posttransplant infections by excluding unsuitable donors and by defining specific infection control policies and antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, which will be necessary after transplantation. The donor and recipient must have a comprehensive history for recent or past infectious disease exposure, particularly when an allogeneic HCT is considered. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pretransplant evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing for evidence of past infectious exposures is performed to detect asymptomatic infection in the HCT donor or candidate. Some tests are recommended for all patients, whereas others are appropriate in selected individuals with epidemiologic risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56453 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pathogen-specific testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active infections in the HCT candidate should be eliminated or suppressed prior to transplantation, whenever possible. Even asymptomatic infections can evolve into invasive disease or overwhelming sepsis following transplantation. Decisions regarding the timing of HCT following initiation of therapy for infections in the HCT donor or candidate must be made on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H155046677\" class=\"local\">'Managing infections prior to HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HCT candidates who have had infections that are likely to recrudesce following HCT, secondary prophylaxis during the period of increased risk is appropriate. Examples of such infections include invasive aspergillosis and disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis).
