Nipple discharge is categorized as normal milk production (lactation), physiologic nipple discharge, or pathologic (suspicious) nipple discharge. The most common causes of pathologic nipple discharge are benign intraductal papilloma (35 to 48 percent), ductal ectasia (17 to 36 percent), and carcinoma (5 to 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Surgical management of pathologic nipple discharge is discussed here.

However, some experts have questioned whether surgical excision is necessary for all patients diagnosed with high-risk lesions on core needle biopsy based upon several retrospective reviews with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/7-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The primary concern is the risk of sampling error that may occur with needle biopsy and the known rates of carcinoma associated with these specific lesions found on core needle biopsy.

Patients who are found to have intraductal masses by either galactography or ductoscopy should be considered for surgical excision of the involved duct to rule out malignancy. Lesions identified on MRI should undergo image-guided needle biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391014\"><span class=\"h5\">Galactography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Galactography can identify and localize intraductal masses undetected by US, mammogram, or breast MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. It is particularly useful for the patient with uniductal, pathologic nipple discharge. During a galactography examination, the discharging nipple orifice is cannulated and injected with a small amount of contrast material, which allows a subsequent mammogram to visualize a filling defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103422\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103422 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although peripheral intraductal masses have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], the vast majority of intraductal masses are centrally located, near or immediately deep to the nipple-areolar complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391269\"><span class=\"h5\">Ductoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammary ductoscopy may be used to evaluate patients with either bloody nipple discharge or high-volume nonbloody discharge from a single duct orifice.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For some patients with significant amounts of nipple discharge, duct excision may be appropriate even when there is no pathologic finding (eg, intraductal mass). Copious amounts of nipple discharge may be anxiety provoking and socially embarrassing. In these patients, surgery is intended to alleviate nipple discharge as a symptom. All excised tissue should still be appropriately oriented and sent for pathologic analysis, even if there is no concern for malignancy. Excellent rates of success and symptom relief have been reported with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3114069132\"><span class=\"h5\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced MRI has demonstrated sensitivities of 93 to 100 percent for invasive cancers as well as benign papillary lesions; however, specificity has been reported to be as low as 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. MRI is also capable of identifying an etiology of discharge that is remote from the vicinity of the nipple. Some studies support the use of MRI over ductoscopy due to its higher sensitivity and specificity; however, this remains an area of controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24532425\"><span class=\"h4\">Bilateral bloody discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral bloody nipple discharge is rare but has been reported in association with benign duct ectasia, papilloma, and carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Given its potential to be associated with malignancy, a thorough workup that includes imaging and exam of each breast individually to identify an etiology should be undertaken, following which potentially bilateral surgical interventions can be performed for high-risk lesions and carcinoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15995173\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15995203\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breasts are located within the superficial fascia of the anterior chest wall, with the majority of the breast tissue resting on the pectoralis major fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88523 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Breasts are primarily composed of fatty tissue and breast parenchyma. Most nipples contain five to nine ductal orifices arranged in a central and a peripheral group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The central ducts course posteriorly towards the chest wall, and the peripheral ducts drape over the central ducts in a radial manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the breast reveals that there are anastomoses between ducts and that the typical breast contains 15 to 20 mammary <span class=\"nowrap\">ductal/lobular</span> systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Careful dissection reveals that most ducts increase in diameter as they traverse deeper into the breast and that not all orifices are located within the very tip section of the nipple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

For motivated patients, however, duct excision can be performed under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation. Typically, local anesthesia without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should be used to minimize the theoretical risk of necrosing small blood vessels near the nipple. Appropriate risk screening should be performed in patients prior to undergoing general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10392713\"><span class=\"h2\">Localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an intraductal lesion is not palpable or not clearly associated with nipple discharge, preoperative localization can be performed to facilitate excision. Localization is typically performed with mammographic or ultrasound guidance. Commonly, localization is performed via placement of a thin wire into the lesion of concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Alternate methods of localization such as intraoperative ultrasound localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>], hematoma-guided localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], seed localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], radiocolloid localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and reflector-guided localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] have also become available. Localizing the target lesion ensures excellent rates of removal and decreases the need for reexcision in patients with cancer. It is particularly helpful for lesions that are not located in the immediate subareolar location. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391440\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The breast surgeon may elect to excise a single duct or the entire ductal system, depending upon whether or not the pathologic nipple discharge can be traced to a single duct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15995226\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesion not localized: Complete subareolar duct excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who require complete subareolar duct incision, a periareolar incision along the lateral portion of the areola that circumnavigates no more than 30 percent of the circumference of the areola allows adequate access and minimizes the risk of nipple necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103423\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103423 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Dissection is carried toward the nipple duct elements with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection. The ductal elements are freed from their attachments to the nipple with sharp dissection, taking care not to injure the nipple itself. This can be done by placing the operator's nondominant hand on the skin side of the nipple. If the location of the lesion is not known, care should be taken to remove 2 to 3 cm of breast parenchyma deep to the nipple itself, thereby maximizing the chances of excising the target lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/10,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,50,51</a>]. It is important to orient the specimen to allow for directed excision of surgical margins if cancer is the final diagnosis. Additionally, a specimen radiograph should be obtained if localization was performed to ensure removal of the area of concern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103424\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103424 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>After complete subareolar duct excision, some surgeons advocate closure of the orifice stumps from the underside of the nipple with 4-0 Prolene sutures to avoid potential formation of fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. There are no studies to confirm the efficacy of this type of suture closure to reduce fistulas as opposed to simply letting the subareolar tissue scar in with time.</p><p>Skin closure can be performed with standard suture closure or with tissue adhesives, with no data to support one approach over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Suture closure is typically performed with two layers of sutures, a deep dermal layer followed by a subcuticular skin layer. Due to the small amount of tissue excised, there is no need for placement of surgical drains, and patients normally heal without difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15995240\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesion localized: Microductectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the discharging duct can be identified, it can be localized with the assistance of a lacrimal duct probe and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103493\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef103493 \">movie 1</a>). One study utilized a light-emitting wire to enhance visualization of the involved duct and reported shorter surgery times with smaller amounts of tissue volume excised when this technique was compared with methylene blue injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Dissection is then carried out to completely remove the duct without injuring the other nipple ductal elements. This may be the preferred approach in patients who wish to preserve the ability to breast feed and may preserve the ability of the nipple to respond to sexual stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15995254\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a standard, duct excision is performed as an outpatient procedure, with patients going home on the same day as the operation. Narcotic pain medications may be required and are prescribed for patients to take as needed. If a waterproof dressing such as Tegaderm is applied, the patient may shower while the primary dressing is maintained. The primary dressing is usually removed 48 to 72 hours after the operation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15995261\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All specimens removed are sent for pathological analysis.
