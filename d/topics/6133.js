Ependymomas occasionally occur within the brain parenchyma or outside the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p>Ependymomas account for less than 10 percent of tumors arising in the CNS and 25 percent of primary tumors originating in the spinal cord.</p><p>The clinical presentation and management of ependymomas arising in the brain will be reviewed here. Ependymomas arising in the spinal cord are discussed separately.

A link to exposure to simian virus 40 (SV40) was postulated based upon identification of the virus in tumor tissue. However, a causal relationship has not been confirmed, and SV40 is no longer considered either a risk factor or an etiologic agent in the development of ependymoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Viral infection'</a>.)</p><p>There is an increased association of intramedullary spinal cord ependymoma in patients with neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], although abnormalities in the <em>NF2</em> gene have not been identified in the majority of sporadic ependymoma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors, ependymal tumors are divided into four major subtypes: myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO grade I), subependymoma (WHO grade I), classic ependymoma (WHO grade II), and anaplastic ependymoma (WHO grade III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109513\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109513 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. New to the 2016 revision of the WHO classification is the subcategory <em>RELA</em> fusion-positive ependymoma, which can include both grade II and grade III tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1296274\"><span class=\"h3\">Ependymoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ependymomas are generally slow-growing tumors of children and young adults and are usually classified as &quot;classic ependymoma,&quot; or WHO grade II, and &quot;anaplastic ependymoma,&quot; or WHO grade III. These tumors can occur anywhere in the ventricular system or spinal canal; they are most common in the fourth ventricle and spinal cord. </p><p>Ependymomas are usually well demarcated with frequent areas of calcification, hemorrhage, and cysts. The tumor cells often form ependymal rosettes, which are diagnostic but not always present. Ependymomas are divided into cellular, papillary, clear cell, and tanycytic subtypes. Further classification of ependymomas into additional subtypes is probable, based at least in part upon advances in understanding the molecular biology of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>There is considerable controversy regarding the prognostic significance of ependymoma grade (grade II versus grade III). While some reports have indicated a poorer prognosis for anaplastic ependymoma (grade III), this has not been confirmed in most studies, the majority of which were performed retrospectively. Variability in the histologic differentiation of classic from anaplastic ependymoma among neuropathologists may account for these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a large molecular analysis of 379 patient samples, nestin expression was correlated with a poor prognosis and was more accurate than histologic grading in predicting outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>With improvements in the molecular classification of tumors, genomic data are now being incorporated into the characterization and prognostication of diseases such as ependymoma. <em>RELA</em> fusion-positive ependymomas, which predominate in the supratentorial region and have a poor prognosis, are now part of the WHO classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109513\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109513 \">table 1</a>). <em>YAP</em>-fusion tumors, by contrast, may have a better prognosis, although this subcategory is not yet recognized by the WHO and will need prospective validation. Other molecular subgroups common to the posterior fossa, including group A tumors (enriched in infants and with a poor outcome) and group B tumors (older children and adults with a better prognosis), will need to be evaluated prospectively.

Subependymomas are more common in males. These lesions are usually slow growing and histologically appear benign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1296296\"><span class=\"h3\">Myxopapillary ependymoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myxopapillary ependymomas are slow-growing tumors that typically are found in young adults and are more common in males. These tumors arise almost exclusively in the conus medullaris and filum terminale. Molecular analysis suggests that adult and pediatric tumors differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Although ependymoblastomas formerly were considered a variant of ependymoma, these tumors are now classified in the group of embryonal tumors (ETs) and are referred to as embryonal tumors with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR). Ependymoblastomas were included in some early series describing the natural history of ependymoma and accounted for many of the cases of leptomeningeal dissemination previously associated with this tumor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic changes are common in ependymomas and may vary based on anatomic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/11-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-21</a>].</p><p>One comprehensive genomic study divided ependymoma into three distinct subgroups based upon site of origin (supratentorial, posterior fossa, and spinal cord) and suggested the presence of molecular subgroups within each anatomic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another group documented two easily distinguishable molecular subgroups, A and B, within posterior fossa tumors that have prognostic implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The poor prognostic subgroup (group A), found predominantly in infants, exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype and transcriptional silencing of the polycomb repressive complex 2, leading to repressed expression of differentiation genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These subgroups are a strong predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In supratentorial ependymomas, an oncogenic fusion between <em>RELA</em>, the principal effector of NF-&kappa;B signaling, and <em>C11orf95</em>, a poorly characterized gene also located on chromosome 11, has been identified and confers a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This genetic alteration was present in 29 out of 41 supratentorial tumors and 0 out of 64 posterior fossa tumors examined. Another group found the same alteration in 14 out of 18 supratentorial ependymomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The <em>C11orf95-RELA</em> fusion gene is most commonly detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

As a result, headache, nausea and vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, and papilledema are common at presentation. Cranial nerve palsies are also common, especially involving cranial nerves VI to X. Brainstem invasion may occur.

The incidence is higher with infratentorial ependymomas compared with supratentorial tumors (9.0 versus 1.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although historical data suggested a correlation between high-grade histology (classic grade II versus anaplastic grade III) and spinal seeding, more recent data have not confirmed this relationship. (See <a href=\"#H1296274\" class=\"local\">'Ependymoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for tumors that present in the posterior fossa includes medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, and brainstem or choroid plexus tumors. In the supratentorial location, glial tumors, embryonal tumors (ETs), and choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma should be considered.</p><p>The appearance of these tumors on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) may suggest the diagnosis of ependymoma. On MRI, these tumors have a hypointense appearance on T1, and are hyperintense on T2 or proton-density images; gadolinium enhancement is usually prominent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70680%7EONC%2F73184%7EONC%2F80310%7EONC%2F59464\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70680 graphicRef73184 graphicRef80310 graphicRef59464 \">image 1A-D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Extension into the foramen of Luschka is commonly observed. The CT appearance is often hyperdense with homogeneous enhancement; cysts and calcifications are common. The presence of calcifications within a tumor located in the fourth ventricle is highly suggestive but not diagnostic of ependymoma.</p><p>A subependymoma should be suspected in adults who present with a long clinical history and evidence of a nonenhancing, well-demarcated, nodular intraventricular tumor that is isodense on CT, and isointense in T1- and hyperintense in T2-weighted images on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of ependymoma requires histologic confirmation. Because gross total resection is so important, we favor open surgery and not stereotactic biopsy for most patients. Biopsy is recommended in adult patients where the diagnosis is in question.</p><p>All patients should have MRI of the entire neuraxis to exclude metastatic disease, since up to 10 percent of patients have evidence of spinal seeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56153\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56153 \">image 2</a>). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology is important for staging for patients with posterior fossa lesions and those with anaplastic tumors. Ideally, CSF should be obtained from either the lumbar site presurgery, which often is contraindicated due to obstructive hydrocephalus, or one to two weeks postoperatively. The prognostic significance of ventricular or cisternal fluid is not well defined. Although uncommon, the presence of metastatic disease significantly affects both treatment and prognosis. One-third of patients with metastatic disease may be identified only on the basis of positive CSF cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment for patients with ependymoma arising in the brain consists of maximal safe resection, which is usually followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy does not appear to play an important role in the management of these tumors in adults and older children, but may in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] or in patients with bulk residual disease. </p><p>Until better molecular prognostic markers are available, current therapeutic approaches continue to focus on the degree of resection as the major determinant of treatment. Incompletely resected ependymomas of either grade (II or III) may benefit from a short course of chemotherapy, followed by second-look surgery if there is residual signal, followed by conformal radiation therapy (RT). Ependymomas of either grade that achieve a complete resection up front should go directly to conformal RT. An exception to these approaches should only occur in the context of approved prospective clinical trials.</p><p>Because of the complexity involved in these cases, patients with ependymomas should be referred to highly specialized centers whenever possible.</p><p>Treatment of spinal cord ependymal tumors is reviewed elsewhere.

Resection is particularly problematic for lesions of the posterior fossa, which are in close proximity to cranial nerves and the brainstem, where there is a significant risk of long-term neurologic dysfunction with gross total resection. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar mutism, also referred to as posterior fossa syndrome, is a recognized complication of posterior fossa surgery and is most common when brainstem invasion is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Patients with incomplete resections do less well than those with gross total resection. As a result, many centers consider a second-look operation following chemotherapy in order to achieve macroscopic clearance.

However, in young children, RT can cause severe neurocognitive impairment and other radiation-induced complications. Chemotherapy is being studied as a way to postpone or completely avoid the need for RT. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Retrospective data indicate that patients with supratentorial nonanaplastic tumors who have gross tumor resection with a wide margin of normal tissue may do well without adjuvant RT, and the role of adjuvant RT in this setting remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/42,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45-47</a>]. Because most recurrences are local, patients who recur can often be salvaged with further surgery and postoperative RT.</p><p>The amount of normal tissue to be included in the RT treatment volume of posterior fossa ependymoma and anaplastic supratentorial ependymoma has been a source of controversy in the past. Data from observational series have now defined local radiotherapy, using contemporary techniques, as the standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conformal techniques allow irradiation of the tumor bed and an adequate margin of adjacent normal tissue while sparing much of the brain.

More extensive radiation fields are indicated if there is evidence of tumor dissemination based upon neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology.</p><p/><p>There are no randomized trials comparing adjuvant RT with observation in patients with ependymoma.

Overall, 36 of 73 children (49 percent) required RT for recurrent disease at a median of 15 months after diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 89 children aged three years or less were treated with combination chemotherapy after maximal surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Of the 80 patients without metastatic disease at presentation, 50 eventually relapsed. At a median follow-up of six years, the five-year EFS and OS rates were 42 and 63 percent, respectively, and the five-year incidence of avoiding RT was 42 percent.</p><p/><p>In a pilot study, five children with anaplastic ependymoma, all under the age of three, were treated with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Four patients had bulk residual and three presented with metastatic disease. All patients made it to age three without RT, and only one progression has been noted at a median follow-up of 45 months.</p><p>Additional study is needed to establish the role of chemotherapy as a component of primary treatment in young children with ependymoma, particularly with the emergence of conformal radiation techniques that have reduced concerns for developmental delay. At present, chemotherapy in place of RT should only be used within the context of a formal protocol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery and RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery and postoperative RT is unclear.</p><p>In one report, 19 children (aged 3 to 14 years) underwent postoperative chemotherapy and radiation after subtotal resection of an intracranial ependymoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The five-year PFS rate was 74 percent, a value that appears higher than published survival results for radiation alone. By contrast, two small randomized studies did not support the role of chemotherapy after surgical resection and RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/36,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,64</a>].</p><p>Although the role of chemotherapy remains uncertain, it may be considered with RT in patients with residual tumor following resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term prognosis for patients with recurrent disease is poor, and while patients can be palliated for extended periods of time, most will eventually succumb within years of relapse. Recurrent disease may be due to local failure, distant disease, or a combination of both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. While multiple treatment options are available, it is important that patients and caregivers understand the poor long-term prognosis of patients with recurrent or progressive ependymoma after RT. Careful selection of treatment options for these patients can provide excellent palliation and good quality of life; no single option is considered standard or proven effective. </p><p>Outside of a formal clinical trial, each patient should be managed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account their age, location of the original and recurrent disease, presence of metastases, prior treatment, and functional status.</p><p>In addition to experimental therapy, multiple approaches have been tried in this population:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive surgical resection may provide effective palliation in some patients. Chemotherapy with or without RT may have a role in reducing residual or recurrent tumor prior to attempted reresection, all aimed at prolonging the time to further disease progression and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/52,55,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55,66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reirradiation of recurrent tumors may be beneficial and has yielded a salvage rate in carefully selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>]. Available techniques include stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), focal fractionated reirradiation, and craniospinal irradiation, depending upon the location and extent of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Patients treated with focal reirradiation remain at risk for the development of disseminated metastases, and recurrence at the primary site eventually occurs in most patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue has not demonstrated benefit in children with recurrent disease. In a series of 15 cases, five died of treatment-related toxicities within two months of marrow reinfusion, eight died from progressive disease a median of six months post-transplantation, one has died from unrelated causes, and one was alive at two years with further disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional chemotherapy may provide symptom palliation.

A clinical trial of bevacizumab and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> in 13 children with recurrent or progressive ependymoma also failed to show significant activity (no objective responses, median time to progression 2.2 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a growing interest in potential molecular targets for ependymoma, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>] and c-Kit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Although the reported degree of benefit has varied, all studies have indicated that patients who can be treated with gross total resection have a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/38,39,49,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39,49,83</a>]. Even with gross total resection, however, ependymomas can recur and lead to death in approximately 40 percent of children by 10 years after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor location &ndash; Comparisons of survival based on tumor location have yielded conflicting results. While several studies have suggested that supratentorial tumors have a better survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/49,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,86</a>], others have found that patients with infratentorial lesions do better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Involvement of the cervical spinal cord has been associated with decreased survival due to failures outside the primary site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic grade &ndash; Grade III ependymomas are associated with worse outcome compared with grade II ependymomas, with 5- and 10-year OS of 57 and 35 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors &ndash; In children, better performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>] and older age are also associated with better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Compared with older children, infants may do less well, partly because they have a higher incidence of infratentorial tumors, and partly because they tend not to receive timely adjuvant radiotherapy due to toxic effects on brain development.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal changes &ndash; Deletion of <em>CDKN2A</em> and gain of chromosome 1 are associated with shorter OS and PFS. By contrast, loss of chromosome 6 or gains of chromosomes 9, 15, or 18 were associated with significantly better OS and PFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Presence of <em>RELA</em> fusion event confers a poor prognosis.

These composed three subgroups in each of the major anatomic compartments (supratentorial, infratentorial, and spine), some of which were defined by unique molecular signatures and had prognostic significance. Prospective clinical trials will need to validate these markers but may resolve many of the current inconsistencies in the predication of outcome for ependymoma patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults &ndash; Two large European multi-institution series that included a total of 222 patients and 123 patients from a single United States institution have analyzed the outcomes and prognostic factors for adults with intracranial ependymomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>]. In these series, the five-year survival rate ranged from 67 to 85 percent, and the 10-year survival varied from 50 to 77 percent. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with a poor prognosis included high histologic grade, incomplete surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/92,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,94</a>], and a Karnofsky performance status &le;80 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ependymoma/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].
