As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is often refractory to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with MDS die because of the consequences of bone marrow failure rather than development of AML. Thus, use of terms such as &quot;pre-leukemia&quot; or &quot;smoldering leukemia&quot; can be misleading if taken to imply that death or morbidity from MDS results only when AML develops. Indeed, the distinction between MDS and AML is itself arbitrary, as patients with 20 to 30 percent blasts are considered to have MDS by French-American-British (FAB) criteria, but AML by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. </p><p>For many years, transfusion with packed red blood cells and platelets and the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents were the only therapy available. More recently, chemotherapy agents directed at the underlying disorder have been developed and continue to be studied for patients with MDS (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>). However, due to the advanced age of most patients, the chronicity of the disease, and its attendant morbidities, supportive care remains a central component of the management of all patients with MDS. Patients should be treated as needed with antibiotics for infection and platelet transfusions for bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no consensus regarding a standard treatment approach for patients with symptomatic MDS, and patients should be encouraged to enroll on clinical trials whenever available.

This includes virtually all patients with high or very high risk MDS. Asymptomatic patients with lower risk MDS may be followed expectantly with serial examinations and laboratory studies. Immunizations should be updated and smoking ceased.

Our treatment approach is similar to that proposed by the MDS Panel for Practice Guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European LeukemiaNet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This approach incorporates knowledge of the patient&rsquo;s performance status, the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-myelodysplastic-syndrome-international-prognostic-scoring-system-original-ipss-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and revised IPSS (IPSS-R) MDS risk categories, and other disease characteristics (ie, cytopenias present, serum erythropoietin level) to help guide management decisions. However, despite the increased availability of treatment guidelines, it is important to individualize care for the patient with MDS.</p><p>Treatment options for patients with MDS typically fall into one of three categories: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care includes the use of antibiotics for infection and red cell and platelet transfusions in the setting of symptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Prophylactic antibiotics are generally not helpful and this strategy may select for antibiotic resistance. Supportive care is an important adjunct to the management of <strong>all</strong> patients with MDS and can be considered as the sole treatment modality for a subset of patients with lower risk MDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low intensity therapies include hematopoietic growth factors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>, immunosuppressive therapy, and low intensity chemotherapy. These can be administered in the outpatient setting and have a low risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Low intensity treatments can improve symptoms and quality of life, but are not curative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High intensity therapies include intensive combination chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). They require hospitalization and entail significant risk of treatment-related mortality. However, these treatments may improve blood counts more quickly than less intensive therapy, reduce the risk of death from MDS, and may alter the MDS disease course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>High intensity therapies are generally reserved for patients with high or very high IPSS-R scores. This allows for the avoidance of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in most patients with a relatively good prognosis, and allows for the aggressive treatment of disease in those with a poor prognosis. </p><p>Of note, there are certain patient populations that require special attention and modification of this approach. As an example, patients with therapy-related MDS have a particularly poor prognosis and are treated in a similar fashion to those with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (See <a href=\"#H518259\" class=\"local\">'Special patient populations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48546540\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a high (&gt;4.5 to 6 points) or very high (&gt;6 points) IPSS-R score have an estimated median survival of 8 to 18 months with supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Those with a good performance status are primarily treated with intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in an attempt to alter the disease course. In this sense, their treatment is very similar to that for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The natural history and response to treatment in <span class=\"nowrap\">high-risk/very</span> high risk MDS is more reminiscent of AML than of lower risk MDS. Indeed the distinction between high-risk MDS and AML is arbitrary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myeloid-leukemia-treatment-and-outcomes-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myeloid leukemia: Treatment and outcomes in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Allogeneic HCT is the only treatment for MDS with the potential for cure, but its use has been limited by donor availability and the advanced age of most patients with this disorder. However, the advent of reduced intensity HCT, which relies on a graft-versus-host disease effect and the use of matched unrelated donors has extended the applicability of HCT to patients in their 60s and even early 70s. Such intensive therapies are preferred in this patient group because of a low expected median survival and high rate of development of acute myeloid leukemia when these patients are treated with supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This treatment approach may also be considered for patients with a WHO Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) score of high or very high risk. Patients with an intermediate risk IPSS-R score may be treated with this approach or with those used for higher risk MDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults#H861596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes in adults&quot;, section on 'WHO prognostic scoring system (WPSS)'</a> and <a href=\"#H17341143\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate risk IPSS-R'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H9989758\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity regimens'</a>.)</p><p>As such, our choice of preferred therapy depends largely upon the patient&rsquo;s candidacy for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with high or very high IPSS-R risk scores who are eligible for allogeneic HCT and have an available related or unrelated matched donor, we recommend high intensity chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT. If a donor is not available, these patients may be treated with intensive induction therapy alone such as that used for AML or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a> with plans to treat with intensive induction therapy at the time of AML transformation.

Such a team can integrate information regarding patient specific factors (eg, age, comorbidities, prior therapies), disease biology (eg, cytogenetics), and transplant-related factors (eg, preparative regimen, donor source) that impact the prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48546547\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High intensity chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in MDS has been limited by donor availability and the advanced age of most patients with this disorder. Following improvements in technique and supportive care and the introduction of reduced intensity conditioning regimens, the upper age limit for allogeneic HCT has been increased to 70 years. In addition, it seems likely that results with matched unrelated donor transplants are similar to those seen with matched sibling transplants, further extending the applicability of allogeneic HCT in MDS. Nonetheless, allogeneic HCT is still not an option for many patients with MDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Allogeneic HCT should be considered for patients with MDS who are &lt;70 years old and have an estimated survival sufficiently short as to balance the risks associated with allogeneic HCT. The decision to pursue HCT depends upon a number of criteria, including the IPSS score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 1</a>) and risk of disease progression, with particular reference to underlying infections and the overall health of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. </p><p>Using decision analysis and prospectively collected registry data, and in the absence of data from randomized trials, the following recommendations have been made concerning the timing of allogeneic HCT in patients with MDS as classified by the original IPSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in the low and intermediate-1 IPSS risk groups, delayed transplantation is associated with maximum discounted and quality-adjusted discounted life years.

However, use of more restrictive matching criteria means that fewer patients will find donors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Unrelated donors'</a>.)</p><p/><p>As with all reports of new treatments, attention must be given to the possibility that patients receiving these treatments represent only a small, unrepresentative subset of patients with MDS.

This likely reflects the older age of patients with MDS, the stem cell nature of the disease, and the presence of poor risk cytogenetics, rather than a specific unfavorable effect due to MDS per se.
