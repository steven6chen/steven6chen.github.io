The acute illness is self-limited and is characterized by high fever, nonexudative conjunctivitis, inflammation of the oral mucosa, rash, cervical adenopathy, and findings in the extremities, including swollen hands and feet, red palms and soles, and, later, subungual peeling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-epidemiology-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with KD are at risk for serious cardiovascular sequelae, particularly coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs), which can lead to myocardial ischemia, infarction, and sudden death. The risk of developing CAAs is highest among children with KD who are not treated early in the disease with high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). Thus, initial management of patients with KD is focused on early diagnosis and treatment with IVIG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management and prognosis of cardiac sequelae of KD, including CAA, will be reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Aspirin'</a>.)</p><p>To reduce the risk of coronary thrombosis, low-dose aspirin (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) is continued for a minimum of four to six weeks following the acute phase treatment, at which time it can be determined if coronary abnormalities have developed. The transition from high- to low-dose aspirin is typically made once the patient has been afebrile for 48 hours. By four to six weeks, if CAAs have not developed, aspirin is discontinued. For patients with CAAs who continue on aspirin therapy, long-term therapy with ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be harmful and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>All children should have general counseling regarding healthy lifestyle and activity at primary care visits. It is also reasonable for the primary care provider to assess usual risk factors for atherosclerosis at least one year from the episode of acute KD. (See <a href=\"#H734902337\" class=\"local\">'Counseling and screening for risk factors'</a> below.) </p><p>Additional treatment depends chiefly on the size and persistence of CAAs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115401\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115401 \">algorithm 1</a>), as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930703088\"><span class=\"h3\">No coronary involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with no coronary involvement (Z-score always &lt;2 <strong>and</strong> no more than a 0.9 decrease in Z-score during follow-up) can discontinue aspirin therapy after four to six weeks. No further medical therapy is necessary and long-term follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist is generally not indicated. The primary care provider should provide general counseling regarding healthy lifestyle and physical activity promotion.

No further medical therapy is necessary. If luminal dimensions have returned to normal, long-term follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist is generally not indicated.

Other antiplatelet agents (eg, clopidogrel) are reasonable alternatives for patients who are intolerant to aspirin. Additional medical therapy is generally not necessary. Some experts use statins in this setting for the theoretical benefit of its non-lipid-lowering (pleiotropic) effects, although data to support this approach are limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of benefit of lipid-lowering drugs in patients with coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If the aneurysm regresses to a normal size or to dilation only, aspirin can be discontinued.

We typically continue aspirin even if the aneurysm remodels to normal or dilation only, unless the patient experiences or is at risk for adverse effects from aspirin therapy.</p><p>In select high-risk patients with persistent medium-sized aneurysms, dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, with addition of clopidogrel) may be considered. Data are limited to guide this practice. We base the decision to use dual antiplatelet therapy on the size of the aneurysm (eg, Z-scores 7.5 to &lt;10).

Observational data suggest that combined therapy is more effective than aspirin alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. If the CAA regresses to a small or medium size, systemic anticoagulation can be discontinued. In patients with remodeling of a large or giant aneurysm to medium size, dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) is reasonable.</p><p>Special considerations in select patients with large and giant CAAs include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infants</strong> &ndash; In infants, anticoagulation treatment should be based on the criterion of Z-score &ge;10 rather than maximum internal diameter of &ge;8 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. LMWH is preferred over warfarin because of its predictable anticoagulant response.

In such patients, treatment with &quot;triple therapy&quot; (ie, low-dose aspirin plus a second antiplatelet agent [eg, clopidogrel] plus systemic anticoagulation) may be considered. The risks of coronary thrombosis and occlusion must be weighed against the risks of bleeding, and the trade-offs should be periodically reassessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adolescent females who are sexually active or pregnant</strong> &ndash; Adolescent females with CAAs should receive reproductive counseling during adolescence.

Frequent evaluation with echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) should be performed in patients with giant aneurysms. A worsening of ventricular function or a change in ECG should raise suspicion for coronary thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H746620469\" class=\"local\">'Long-term follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of six retrospective studies in patients with giant CAAs, combined therapy with systemic anticoagulation (chiefly warfarin) plus aspirin was associated with lower rates of myocardial infraction (odds ratio [OR] 0.27; 95% CI 0.11-0.63) and death (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.02-0.29) compared with aspirin alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

We typically continue aspirin even if the aneurysm remodels to normal or dilation only, unless the patient experiences or is at risk for adverse effects from aspirin therapy. In select high-risk patients with persistent medium-sized aneurysms, dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, with addition of clopidogrel) may be considered. (See <a href=\"#H4265848258\" class=\"local\">'Medium aneurysms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Large and giant aneurysms &ndash; For patients with large and giant aneurysms (Z-score &ge;10, or absolute dimension &ge;8 mm), we suggest long-term systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or warfarin in addition to low-dose aspirin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If the aneurysm regresses to a small or medium size, systemic anticoagulation can be discontinued, but low-dose aspirin is continued. (See <a href=\"#H666750526\" class=\"local\">'Large and giant aneurysms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CAAs who continue on aspirin therapy, long-term therapy with ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be harmful and should generally be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H1465307134\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of coronary thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who suffer acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we recommend urgent therapy for reperfusion and revascularization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The choice of therapeutic intervention is dependent on the size of the patient and the timing of AMI relative to the phase of illness. For patients who are beyond the <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/subacute</span> phase of the illness and who are large enough for use of adult-sized catheters, immediate angiography with mechanical restoration of myocardial blood flow is the procedure of choice. In smaller patients and those in the <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/subacute</span> phase of illness, systemic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase; 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour intravenously for six hours) is given together with aspirin and heparin. (See <a href=\"#H2627499576\" class=\"local\">'Myocardial infarction and coronary thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with clinical signs of coronary ischemia including reversible ischemia on stress testing, we suggest coronary artery revascularization intervention be performed (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7734339\" class=\"local\">'Coronary revascularization procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term follow-up care of patients with KD is based on the coronary artery status of the patient and includes assessment of other cardiovascular risk factors, screening for dyslipidemia, promoting a heart healthy diet, and exercise recommendations. (See <a href=\"#H746620469\" class=\"local\">'Long-term follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with KD and CAAs, the prognosis depends upon the size of the aneurysm. Small aneurysms generally have a favorable prognosis with a low risk of myocardial ischemic events <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality. In contrast, large and giant aneurysms (ie, those with Z-score &ge;10 or an internal diameter &gt;8 mm) have a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Up to one-half of such aneurysms become obstructed, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or sudden death. (See <a href=\"#H3119159481\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Giglia TM, Massicotte MP, Tweddell JS, et al.
