Many clinical situations are appropriate for the placement of catheters, but too frequently they are used without proper indication or continued longer than needed. Daily evaluation of the ongoing need for the catheter is essential to reduce complications. Alternatives to indwelling urethral catheterization should be considered and include external sheath (ie, condom) catheters, suprapubic catheters, intermittent catheterization, and in some cases, supportive management with protective garments. Our recommendations for urinary bladder catheter placement and care are generally consistent with major guidelines that focus on prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss the use and management of urinary bladder catheters.

The presence of blood at the meatus or gross hematuria associated with trauma is evaluated first with retrograde urethrogram; urologic consultation and urethroscopy may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Retrograde urethrogram'</a>.)</p><p>Relative contraindications to urethral catheterization include urethral stricture, recent urinary tract surgery (ie, urethra, bladder), and the presence of an artificial sphincter. For these issues, a urologist or urogynecologist should be consulted to assist with management.</p><p>If an artificial sphincter is present, it should be de-activated and catheterization limited to a short period of time. Artificial sphincters are discussed elsewhere.

The most common inappropriate indication for placing an indwelling urethral catheter is management of urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While catheter use in these patients may have a short-term nursing benefit, the increased risk of complications associated with their use outweighs any benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/8,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is also inappropriate to use catheters to obtain urine for testing in individuals who are capable of voiding spontaneously or who can reliably collect urine for monitoring output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Catheters are also often used to measure residual urinary bladder volume in hospitalized patients; however, we prefer the use of a portable ultrasound unit (eg, BladderScan). These devices correctly estimate residual volume greater than 50 mL in &gt;90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF CATHETER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of catheter depends upon clinical indication and expected duration of catheterization. Different catheters can be used during the course of care reflecting the patient's changing needs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76684 \">table 1</a>). The best alternative to an indwelling urethral catheter should be considered. </p><p>Although urethral catheters are frequently used initially, substituting external catheters, or intermittent catheterization, can reduce complications. In a network meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials, the risk of urinary tract infection was comparable between indwelling urethral catheterization, suprapubic tube, and intermittent catheterization if catheterization duration was &le;5 days. If catheterization duration was &gt;5 days, however, intermittent catheterization and suprapubic tube were associated with significantly decreased risk of urinary tract infection compared with indwelling urethral catheterization (odds ratio [OR] 0.173, 95% CI 0.073-0.412 and OR 0.142, 95% CI 0.073-0.276, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the initial choice of catheter may be influenced by factors other than the risk of urinary tract infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">External</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External catheter systems are the least invasive for urine drainage and are available as penile sheath catheters (ie, condom catheters) for men or urinary pouches for men or women. External catheters are not appropriate for accurate urine measurement or management of urinary obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76684 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'External catheter systems'</a> below.)</p><p>Condom catheters are an effective mode of collecting urine in men who do not have evidence for urinary retention or urinary obstruction. A condom catheter does not facilitate bladder drainage; it only collects urine. They are widely used in chronic care facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Contraindications to their use include the presence of penile ulceration or perineal dermatitis. It is important to ensure the patient has adequate manual dexterity if he is expected to place the device himself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Advantages of condom catheters are minimization of urethral trauma and improved comfort and mobility compared with indwelling catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The decreased incidence of urinary tract infection associated with condom catheters is dependent upon patient cooperation and minimization of catheter manipulation.</p><p>The main disadvantage of condom catheters is irritation if attached too tightly; penile ulceration, scarring, and penile tissue loss can result. Dislodgement and urinary spillage can also be problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

They are also used for management for patients with chronic urinary retention who are refractory to, or not candidates for, other interventions (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent catheterization, which is the removal of the catheter immediately after bladder decompression with recatheterization on a scheduled basis, is an alternative to indwelling catheterization. When intermittent catheterization is used, it must be performed at regular intervals to prevent bladder overdistention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clean intermittent catheterization'</a> below.)</p><p>Intermittent urethral catheterization can be used for either short- or long-term management of urinary retention or neurogenic bladder dysfunction (eg, patients with spinal cord dysfunction, myelomeningocele, or bladder atonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/18,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25-27</a>]. Despite its advantage of reducing complications, intermittent catheterization is not commonly used for short-term catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/28-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-37</a>]. Isolated (single) use of intermittent catheterization can be applied to achieve isolated decompression of a distended bladder, or instillation of pharmacologic therapy.</p><p>Intermittent catheterization may not be possible for some patients due to upper-extremity impairment, discomfort, obesity, or urinary obstruction (eg, enlarged prostate, urethral stricture) and others who may not be willing to perform the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Suprapubic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suprapubic catheters are the most invasive catheter and require a surgical procedure for placement, usually by a urologist or urogynecologist. A suprapubic catheter is placed through the abdominal wall and into the bladder either intraoperatively in association with another surgical procedure or percutaneously.</p><p>Suprapubic catheterization prevents urethral trauma and stricture formation, reduces the incidence of catheter-associated bacteriuria (at least temporarily), and may be associated with increased patient satisfaction compared with chronic indwelling urethral catheters. Suprapubic catheterization allows attempts at normal voiding without the need for recatheterization and interferes less with sexual activity. Patient comfort and preference usually dictate the choice.</p><p>Various types of suprapubic tubes are available including balloon (eg, Foley, Rutner) and mushroom (eg, Malecot) catheters with a single lumen in sizes ranging from 10 to 18 F. No benefit has been shown for any particular catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER TECHNOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most catheters have dual lumen tubes with one lumen draining the catheter and the other delivering water to the balloon. The first balloon catheter was designed in the 1930s by a surgeon, Frederic Foley; the basic catheter retains his name.</p><p>For most adults requiring urethral catheterization, a standard Foley catheter (ie, double-lumen latex) is appropriate. Single or multiple-use straight catheters without a balloon are used for intermittent catheterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sizing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter size should be individualized to the needs of the patient. In adults, a 14 to 16 French <span class=\"nowrap\">(Fr/3</span> = diameter in millimeters) catheter is typically chosen for short-term indwelling catheterization. Larger catheters, 20 to 24 F, are used to provide an adequate bore for the drainage of hematuria or clots. Sizing charts are available to determine the proper diameter for children.</p><p>Both short (21 cm) and longer (40 to 45 cm) catheter lengths are available. Shorter catheters may be more appropriate for women.</p><p>Two balloon volumes are available, 5 mL and 20 to 30 mL. For most patients, a 5 mL balloon is adequate. A larger balloon volume may be desirable in some postoperative patients or women with weak pelvic musculature if urine leakage occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Managing leakage'</a> below.)</p><p>External sheath catheters (ie, condom catheters) are available in many sizes and use of a measurement or sizing guide is recommended. Penile circumferential measurement is taken at the mid shaft of the non-erect penis as it is gently extended away from the body. Size is adjusted as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheters are manufactured from latex, silicone, plastic, or Teflon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Latex catheters are inexpensive and the most commonly used. However, latex is associated with urethral inflammation which may be due to protein and salt encrustation on the surface of the catheter. Chronic inflammation from prolonged catheter use can lead to urethral stricture. For this reason and the potential for latex allergy, silicone catheters may be preferable when more prolonged catheterization is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Removable tips are available for men who also need to perform intermittent catheterization.</p><p>Most sheath catheters are pre-rolled and incorporate a self-adhesive vertical strip which provides penile fixation. Self-adhesive sheaths have fewer complications compared with those that require separate adhesive strips or other fixating devices. These are often circumferentially placed and can cause undue tissue compression.

Based primarily upon a prospective study of 676 patients, the use of closed catheter urinary drainage system is the standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In this prospective trial, the incidence of bacteriuria in patients managed with continuously closed urinary drainage was 23 percent compared with a reported historic incidence of 95 percent for open urinary drainage.

Cross-contamination of bacteria from one patient to another is possible, and outbreaks of urinary tract infection with highly resistant organisms have occurred.

Devices are placed per manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>For self-adhesive penile condom catheters, the penis is cleansed with soap and water and dried prior to application of the new device. The condom catheter is applied to the tip of the penis and rolled up the length of the penis, gently pressing the self-adhesive strip into place. It is important to unroll as completely as possible to minimize any residual roller ring which can produce tissue compression.

The catheter used for intermittent catheterization is easier to insert; it is less bulky at the tip because there is no balloon. While indwelling catheter placement is always performed with sterile technique, intermittent catheterization can be performed with either sterile or nonsterile, clean technique. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clean intermittent catheterization'</a> below.)</p><p>A typical urethral catheterization kit includes sterile gloves, drapes, antiseptic solution and sponges for periurethral cleansing, a single-use lubricant gel packet, urinary catheter, 5 mL syringe filled with sterile water for balloon inflation, and urine drainage system. Several trials have found no significant differences in the rates of bacteriuria or urinary tract infection for obstetric patients prepared with water compared with antiseptic solution prior to catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]; we prefer to use the antiseptic agent already provided in the kit. </p><p>The patient is placed in a supine position. In women, the lower extremities are frog-legged to maximize exposure of the periurethral region. Adequate lighting is essential. Sterile gloves are donned and the catheterization kit is inspected to ensure its contents are complete and free of defects. If an indwelling catheter is chosen, the balloon can be inflated briefly to check its integrity, but this is generally not necessary. For silicone catheters, checking the balloon should <strong>not</strong> be performed, because the region of the balloon can become wrinkled making make placement more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The end of the catheter, if not pre-attached, can be attached to the drainage system before or after catheter placement.</p><p>Drapes are placed and the periurethral region cleansed. In men, the penis is grasped firmly with the nondominant hand and tension directed toward the ceiling straightening the urethra. In women, the nondominant hand is used to spread the labia to facilitate cleansing the periurethral region and viewing the urethral meatus.</p><p>The gloved dominant hand is used to place the catheter into the urethral meatus and steady gentle pressure used to advance the catheter. When a coude catheter is used, the curved tip of the catheter should be oriented toward the dorsal surface of the penis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87816 \">figure 1</a>). When the catheter tip approaches the external sphincter in men, resistance will be felt. It is often helpful to pause momentarily to let the sphincter relax before continuing insertion. </p><p>The catheter should be inserted to the flared portion of the catheter (ie, hub). The balloon is inflated with sterile water only after the flow of urine is seen. Saline should not be used to inflate the balloon because crystal formation may obstruct the balloon channel and prevent balloon deflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Troubleshooting catheter removal'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the balloon is inflated, the catheter is withdrawn until slight resistance is felt. The urine collection system is connected and the drainage tubing anchored to the leg with tape to prevent traction of the catheter on the urethral meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Troubleshooting urethral catheter placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If no urine is obtained, an assistant can be asked to apply gentle pressure to the suprapubic region which may initiate urine flow. In women the insertion site of the catheter is examined; vaginal catheterization may have occurred. If this is the case, the catheter is removed and a new sterile catheter used.</p><p>If the catheter has passed easily to its hub, suprapubic pressure has been applied, and urine is still not observed, the patient may be dehydrated or may have voided recently. Gentle irrigation through the end of the catheter using 10 to 20 mL sterile saline can be performed and should return the saline mixed with urine. If the saline is not returned or any resistance to catheterization was encountered, underlying pathology may be present and urologic consultation should be obtained.</p><p>If the patient complains of pain during catheter insertion, the catheter should be removed. If blood appears at the meatus or on the tip of the catheter, a urethral injury may have occurred. The procedure is abandoned and a urologic consultation is obtained.

Open suprapubic catheter placement is usually in association with other surgeries (eg, prostate, bladder trauma repair). A 12 to 14 F catheter is generally selected. If the patient has a history of prior lower abdominal surgery, percutaneous suprapubic catheters should not be attempted without simultaneous cystoscopy.</p><p>The percutaneous procedure is performed using sterile technique with local anesthesia, and sedation if needed.

However, catheters with mechanical problems (poor drainage, encrusted) need to be replaced.</p><p>Suprapubic catheters are generally managed by the operating surgeon and are not changed until a tract between the bladder and abdominal wall is established, which usually requires four to six weeks.

If this is not effective, the catheter should be replaced. If there is a suspicion that the latex catheter material contributed to the obstruction, the catheter should be changed to a silicone catheter to reduce future encrustation.</p><p>Antimicrobial irrigation of the bladder does not appear to prevent or delay urinary tract infection; rather, this practice may increase the risk for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. One randomized trial of 200 catheterized patients found no significant difference in the incidence of urinary tract infection for patients treated with a neomycin-polymyxin bladder irrigant compared with no irrigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Patients who received bladder irrigation were found to have more resistant organisms. </p><p>Other approaches to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection associated with bladder catheters include bacterial interference (purposeful inoculation of the bladder with nonpathogenic bacteria) and use of bladder epithelial coating agents.

Removing an indwelling urethral catheter is usually a matter of aspirating the balloon port with an empty syringe which deflates the balloon; the catheter should then slip out. Suprapubic catheters are typically removed by the operating surgeon once the indication for catheter placement has resolved. Beyond association with urinary tract infection and the attendant complications, inappropriate use of indwelling catheters has been associated with increased mortality, further highlighting the importance of catheter removal when it is no longer needed. In a prospective study of 535 elderly hospitalized patients who had no medical indication for catheterization, death within 90 days of hospital discharge was more likely among the 75 patients who received a catheter (25 versus 10 percent among those without a catheter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The association remained despite adjustment for usual predictors of early mortality, suggesting that catheters are hazardous in this setting, or more likely, there is a poorly defined but clear preference for using catheters in patients who are likely to have a poor prognosis.</p><p>Following surgery <strong>not</strong> in the urinary tract, catheters should be removed as soon as possible (ideally in the recovery room) to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. If a catheter was inserted for surgery on the urinary tract, it should only be removed by, or with prior approval of, the surgeon (urologist). A meta-analysis of seven randomized trials found fewer urinary tract infections when urinary catheters were removed within one day postoperatively compared with three days (relative risk 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p>On occasion, clinicians may be unaware that their patient has a urinary catheter, especially if it had been replaced after initial removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Reminders from nursing staff and implementation of automatic stop orders reduce the duration of catheterization and incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/17,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,101</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies that evaluated reminder systems found a 52 percent reduction in the rate (episodes per 1000 catheter-days) of catheter-associated urinary tract infection with the use of a reminder or stop order (rate ratio [RR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.69). The duration of catheterization was decreased by 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Troubleshooting catheter removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The balloon of a urinary catheter may fail to deflate properly due to a faulty valve mechanism or obstructed balloon channel. Obstruction is uncommon and is typically due to the formation of crystals when saline rather than water is used to inflate the balloon, and the catheter has been in place for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>The first line of action if the fluid within the balloon cannot be aspirated is to cut the valve (ie, balloon port) from the catheter at its junction. This should result in immediate flow of water from the balloon. To minimize the potential for urethral trauma, allow some time for the balloon to drain before withdrawing the catheter. Rupturing the balloon by overinflation should not be attempted since balloon fragmentation will result about 80 percent of the time requiring cystoscopy for retrieval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. If cutting the valve fails to deflate the balloon, a urologist or urogynecologist should be consulted. He or she will typically first try to maneuver a ureteric stylet through the inflation channel to dislodge the obstruction. If this fails, the patient will need to be sedated and the balloon punctured sharply with a spinal needle, using a transabdominal, transurethral, or transvaginal approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic antimicrobial agents should not be administered to patients who do not have a proven urinary tract infection in either a short- or long-term catheterization setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/92,103-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,103-107</a>].

In a meta-analysis that included six randomized and one nonrandomized study performed in mostly surgical patients, many of whom had undergone a urologic procedure, antimicrobials given around the time of catheter removal reduced the absolute risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by 5.8 percent (31 infections among 665 patients who received antimicrobials compared with 90 of 855 patients in the control groups, relative risk 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].
