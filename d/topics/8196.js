Clinically, they present with lower limb spasticity and weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2276859\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSP, also called familial spastic paraplegia, was initially referred to as Strumpell-Lorrain disease, a name given for the two physicians who in the late 19th century independently described key features of spastic paraplegia. It has become evident that HSP is not one disease but a mixed group of genetically heterogeneous conditions that result in broadly overlapping clinical features.</p><p>HSPs are clinically differentiated into &quot;pure&quot; forms if spastic paraplegia with bladder involvement is the only clinical finding, and &quot;complicated&quot; (or complex) forms if there are additional neurologic or systemic abnormalities. In the pre-genetic era, attempts were made to further classify HSP based upon age of onset, degree of spasticity, and rate of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Today, however, the classification of HSP is increasingly based upon genetics, especially given the phenotypic heterogeneity of HSP within the same family harboring the same genetic defect.</p><p>The genetic classification of HSP is based upon mode of inheritance, chromosomal locus, and causative mutation (if known) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hereditary spastic paraplegias include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked forms. The genetic loci are designated as SPG (for SPastic parapleGia) and are numbered sequentially as SPG1, SPG2, SPG3, and so on (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95449 \">table 1</a>). The numbering of the SPGs is based upon the order of locus discovery and not on the mechanism of genetic transmission. The number of loci now exceeds 55 and continues to expand (see <a href=\"http://omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS303350&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWJwWXehoXBEBdqnX1vIsqoPjMrYPZx4F1Mto1stBxGNEDEk4KIfUDGMgIb0SsSroWQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14152\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS303350</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The correlation of clinical classification (pure or complicated) with genetic classification (SPG type) is imperfect, and some genetic types of HSP are associated with both pure and complicated phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26506305\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the HSPs are genetically diverse, a shared pathway for these disorders is length-dependent degeneration of the corticospinal tract axons, which is maximal in the thoracic spinal cord, and dorsal column axons in the fasciculus gracilis, which is maximal in the cervical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Thus, the longest motor and sensory axons in the central nervous system appear to be particularly vulnerable to the degenerative process. Although primarily considered as a disorder of long-tract spinal cord axons, the neuropathology of many types of HSP involves additional components of the central and peripheral nervous system, including abnormalities of shorter axons in the cerebellum and corpus callosum, lower motor neurons, peripheral nerves, and myelin. Laboratory and genetic studies suggest a variety of molecular causes for HSP, including disruption in intracellular trafficking, nucleotide metabolism, synapse formation and axon development, axonal transport, mitochondrial function, and myelin maintenance and assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26506245\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSP is rare, with an overall prevalence of approximately 1 to 10 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>]. The disorder affects diverse ethnic groups.

The spasticity is more or less symmetric. Based upon the severity and progression, gait disability may range from mild to severe. In addition, there can be subtle dorsal column impairment in the legs with diminished vibratory sensation distally, though sensory complaints are usually minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Bladder dysfunction is relatively common in HSP, and urinary urgency may be an early or presenting sign. Pes cavus and hammer toes may be seen in HSP.</p><p>With the pure types of HSP, the symptoms are restricted to involvement of the longest tracts of the spinal cord. Speech is not affected, nor is there weakness in the bulbar muscles or arms. </p><p>With the complicated types of HSP, paraplegia coexists with additional neurologic or systemic derangements.

However, much can be done to help the symptoms. The goal of symptomatic treatment is to improve mobility, increase range of motion, and relieve the discomfort associated with spasticity. Supportive treatment can be subdivided into pharmacologic treatment of spasticity and physical therapy and rehabilitation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacological therapy of spasticity &ndash; There are several pharmacological approaches to improve spasticity. These include oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a> (starting at the lowest dose and titrating slowly as tolerated), and botulinum toxin injections into spastic muscles. Benzodiazepines also help in reducing spasticity but their use is now limited because of side effects. To improve their tolerance, antispasticity drugs are started at a low dose and titrated up slowly. The most common side effect of these agents is sedation. Intrathecal baclofen can be used in the more severe cases. Spastic bladder and its associated urge symptoms can be treated with anticholinergic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxybutynin</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical medicine and rehabilitation &ndash; Under the guidance of physical and occupational therapists and rehabilitation physicians, patients with HSP should be encouraged to exercise and engage in therapy that focuses on stretching, reducing spasticity, and improving balance and strength. Some patients can benefit from assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses, walkers, or wheelchairs.</p><p/><p>As with any genetic disease, genetic counseling can help patients learn about the disease transmission and the risk of passing on genetic mutations to their children, particularly for those planning on starting families (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a>). However, genetic counseling can be difficult when the mode of transmission is not evident or when there is variable penetrance. In particular, the frequency of de novo mutations causing autosomal dominant HSP is uncertain, and the full phenotypic spectrum and genetic penetrance of many types of HSP are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Counseling with respect to SPG7 should account for the observation that SPG7 is associated with both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns (see <a href=\"#H18459499\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal recessive HSP'</a> above). Prenatal genetic testing is only possible for certain forms of HSP when the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2276865\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure HSPs do not typically affect lifespan, although they can have a significant deleterious impact on the quality of life.</p><p>The rate of progression and severity of different types of HSP is highly variable among and even within specific genetic types.

A subset of children experience a decline in gait for 5 to 10 years, followed by a &quot;functional plateau&quot; with relatively little or no further decline. With onset later in childhood or adulthood, the most typical pattern is slow but relentless progression over many years, though some individuals experience variable phases of faster or slower progression.</p><p>In a cohort of 608 cases of HSP, progression to loss of independent ambulation occurred at a median disease duration of 22 years, and wheelchair dependency at a median disease duration of 37 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Clinically, they present with lower limb spasticity and weakness. HSPs are clinically differentiated into &quot;pure&quot; forms if spastic paraplegia with bladder involvement is the only clinical finding, and &quot;complicated&quot; (or complex) forms if there are additional neurologic or systemic abnormalities. The genetic classification of HSP is based upon mode of inheritance, chromosomal locus, and causative mutation. The genetic loci are designated as SPG and are numbered sequentially as SPG1, SPG2, SPG3, and so on (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95449 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2276859\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the HSPs are genetically diverse, a shared pathway for these disorders is length-dependent degeneration of the corticospinal tract axons. Laboratory and genetic studies suggest a variety of molecular causes for HSP. (See <a href=\"#H26506305\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, HSP presents with gait impairment caused by leg weakness and spasticity. Bladder dysfunction is relatively common. With the pure types of HSP, the symptoms are restricted to involvement of the longest tracts of the spinal cord. Speech is not affected, nor is there weakness in the bulbar muscles or arms. With the complicated types of HSP, paraplegia coexists with additional neurologic or systemic derangements, such as peripheral neuropathy, MRI brain abnormalities, cognitive impairment, ataxia, distal muscle atrophy, visual loss, or epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H2276984\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal dominant HSPs usually cause a pure HSP phenotype. SPG4 and SPG3A are the most common autosomal dominant HSPs. In contrast, autosomal recessive HSPs are usually associated with a complicated phenotype. SPG5 and SPG11 are the most common autosomal recessive types. X-linked HSPs typically cause complicated forms of HSP. (See <a href=\"#H18459493\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal dominant HSP'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18459499\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal recessive HSP'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18459505\" class=\"local\">'X-linked HSP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HSP is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical manifestations (gait impairment with leg spasticity and weakness, often associated with urinary urgency), a family history of a similar disorder (though not universally present), the exclusion of other disorders, and, increasingly, on molecular genetic testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of HSP is broad and includes the following disease categories (see <a href=\"#H2277011\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Motor neuron disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Structural compromise of the spinal cord, such as tethered cord syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vascular malformations of the spinal cord, particularly spinal dural arteriovenous fistula</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leukodystrophies such as adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy and adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Demyelinating disorders, including progressive multiple sclerosis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dopa-responsive dystonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic disorders, such as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency and cobalamin C deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infectious diseases, particularly tropical spastic paraparesis and human immunodeficiency virus &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hereditary ataxias associated with significant spasticity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no disease-modifying treatment for HSP.
