A parent or other observer may describe tachycardia based on observation of the child's neck veins, palpation of the pulse, or sensation of the heart beating rapidly while holding the child. All complaints of tachycardia require rapid assessment of patient status and cardiac rhythm. In most instances, life-threatening tachycardia can be rapidly detected and treated. This topic will review the differential diagnosis and approach to the child who presents with tachycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of tachycardia in children is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71622 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening cardiac conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most life-threatening cardiac conditions in children that present as tachycardia consist of supraventricular tachycardias. However, any type of arrhythmia may occur depending on specific patient predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)</strong> &ndash; The most common symptomatic dysrhythmia of childhood, SVT may present with palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath in children, or with lethargy, feeding difficulties, or irritability in infants. In many instances, a parent or healthcare provider notes a rapid heart rate during routine care. In newborns and infants with SVT, the heart rate is typically &gt;220 beats per minute (BPM), while in older children the heart rate is &gt;180 BPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SVT in children is most often caused by an accessory atrioventricular pathway. Children may exhibit a range of clinical findings, from no symptoms to cardiogenic shock, depending on the duration of SVT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The term Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is applied when there is a shortened PR interval and ventricular pre-excitation on the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) due to the accessory pathway. SVT may also be associated with drug exposure, especially sympathomimetics contained in high caffeine drinks, <span class=\"nowrap\">cough/cold</span> medications, and dietary supplements, or congenital heart disease (eg, Epstein anomaly, repaired dextrotransposition of the great arteries, single ventricle lesions after Fontan operation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventricular tachycardia (VT)</strong> &ndash; This arrhythmia is uncommon in the pediatric population. VT may result from electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia), congenital heart disorders, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia caused by congenital abnormality of the coronary arteries, or drug toxicity. In addition, patients who have undergone cardiac surgery (eg, ventriculotomy for repair of tetralogy of Fallot) are at risk for these dysrhythmias due to postoperative ventricular scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Most children with atrial flutter have an underlying heart abnormality, such as repaired or palliated congenital heart disease, and there is a significant risk of sudden death if this dysrhythmia cannot be medically or surgically controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</strong> &ndash; HCM manifests as a hypertrophied, nondilated left ventricle and septum. Patients with HCM may present with palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest during strenuous exercise. The subset of HCM patients who present with syncope are at significant risk for sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Clinical findings of myocarditis include tachycardia out of proportion to fever or at rest, poor perfusion, and signs of heart failure. Patients with myocarditis may progress rapidly to cardiogenic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxic exposure</strong> &ndash; Many toxic exposures have the potential to cause life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. The specific arrhythmia depends on the characteristics of the toxic agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66773 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Common conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus tachycardia may result from exercise, fever, anemia, drugs (especially caffeine), <span class=\"nowrap\">anxiety/hyperventilation</span> syndrome, emotional arousal, and pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71622 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute rheumatic fever</strong> &ndash; Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a delayed, nonsuppurative sequela of a pharyngeal infection with the group A streptococcus. Fever and pancarditis are clinical manifestations of this disease that can rarely cause tachydysrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other findings include arthralgia, arthritis, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules, and chorea. Testing for recent streptococcal infection is essential to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong> &ndash; Patients with hyperthyroidism have an increase in cardiac output, caused by both increased peripheral oxygen needs and increased cardiac contractility. Heart rate is increased, pulse pressure is widened, and peripheral vascular resistance is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 10 to 20 percent of adults with hyperthyroidism, is rare in children. Mitral valve prolapse is two to three times more prevalent in hyperthyroid patients than in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Other diagnostic criteria include bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, rash, extremity changes, and lymphadenopathy. Tachycardia accompanies fever and may also signify serious cardiac effects such as pericardial effusion, heart failure, and coronary artery aneurysm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pheochromocytoma</strong> &ndash; Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neoplasms in children. Tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla are termed pheochromocytomas, and those with extraadrenal origins are called paragangliomas. The classic triad of symptoms in these disorders consists of episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia, usually accompanied by hypertension. Malignant hypertension can occur, with its associated complications (eg, increased intracranial pressure, encephalopathy).

Therefore, the initial general assessment of hemodynamic stability is of paramount importance when evaluating a patient with tachycardia. Clinicians should emergently treat the patient with cardiovascular collapse per American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67438\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67438 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tachycardia is defined as the presence of a heart rate value greater than expected for age. Although values are published for specific age groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 3</a>), clinicians may use the basic guideline of &gt;160 BPM for infants (&lt;2 years), &gt;140 BPM for children (2 to 12 years), and &gt;100 BPM for adolescents and adults to define tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77057\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77057 \">table 4</a>). Oxygen desaturation may be present in patients with unrepaired or palliated congenital heart disease.</p><p>Fever suggests the presence of infection, and is most commonly associated with sinus tachycardia although the stress of infection may also precipitate many dysrhythmias.</p><p>In febrile children with sinus tachycardia, the heart rate increase attributable to elevated temperature may be adjusted by deducting approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> for every 1&deg;C elevation in temperatures above 37&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. This correction may be of diagnostic benefit when determining the etiology of tachycardia. However, if fever is felt to be the cause of tachycardia, then the elevated heart rate should resolve when the temperature returns to normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rate irregularity, if present, should be noted. Distant-sounding heart tones may be present in pericardial effusion with tamponade along with pulsus paradoxus. Third and fourth heart sounds or gallop rhythm suggest the presence of myocardial dysfunction. The presence of a murmur suggests underlying structural heart disease. However, innocent &quot;flow&quot; murmurs may be accentuated by hyperdynamic states such as fever, anemia, and sepsis. A laterally displaced point of maximum Impulse (PMI) suggests the presence of cardiomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irregular-heart-rate-arrhythmias-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irregular heart rate (arrhythmias) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-cardiovascular findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dry-appearing or &quot;tacky&quot; mucous membranes suggest <span class=\"nowrap\">dehydration/hypovolemia</span>. Pallor is seen with anemia. Tachypnea, rales, and hepatomegaly are signs of heart failure. Poor perfusion with bounding pulses suggests the &quot;warm shock&quot; of sepsis. Headache and diaphoresis are associated with pheochromocytoma. A widened pulse pressure and thyromegaly may indicate hyperthyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the acutely symptomatic patient with tachycardia, monitoring and assessment of the cardiac rhythm and blood pressure is vital. Bedside cardiac monitors often do not provide satisfactory rhythm tracings to permit detailed decision making. Thus, a standard 12-lead ECG and rhythm strip should be obtained upon presentation and concurrent with any attempts at cardioversion or defibrillation to guide therapy and provide valuable data should the patient require pediatric cardiology consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Even in the asymptomatic patient, continuous monitoring and a standard ECG is often helpful since an ECG is essential in the diagnosis of WPW and long QT syndrome, and may be helpful in the diagnosis of premature atrial and ventricular beats.</p><p>Clinicians should evaluate the presence of electrolyte abnormalities by performing rapid determinations of serum electrolytes, glucose, and calcium. Readily available <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit</span> point of care testing can confirm clinical suspicion of anemia.</p><p>Patients with sepsis warrant measurement of a complete blood count with differential and detection of the causative organism through appropriate cultures of the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, wound cultures and nasopharyngeal swabs for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are important adjuncts for detection of toxic shock and toxic streptococcal syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-ill-appearing-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the ill-appearing infant (younger than 90 days of age)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical findings suggestive of hyperthyroidism can be confirmed by serum thyroid testing. Serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are elevated, and TSH secretion is suppressed in hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the patient presents with an acute tachydysrhythmia, the clinician should obtain an echocardiogram to evaluate myocardial function, as well as to evaluate for underlying structural heart disease soon after normal sinus rhythm is established. In the hemodynamically unstable patient, this study should be performed on an emergent basis, as the information will affect therapeutic decision making.

Ascertainment of a history of known cardiac disease, assessment for shock, and the determination of rhythm are three key decision points in the evaluation of children with tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51655\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51655 \">algorithm 2</a>). Cardiac arrhythmias, other than sinus tachycardia, are rare in children.

Although there are exceptions, a patient with wide QRS complex tachycardia should be considered to have ventricular tachycardia until an alternative diagnosis can be confirmed. Hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or toxic exposures are important etiologies of unstable VT that require specific therapy beyond AHA guidelines for successful rhythm termination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67438\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67438 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Other patients, especially those with underlying structural heart disease, present with other forms of SVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Rapid intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adenosine</a> may be attempted first if intravenous access is immediately available.

Adenosine should be used with extreme caution in patients who have undergone heart transplantation.

Initial care must evaluate for substrate deficiency (ie, hypoxemia or hypoglycemia) that is frequently associated with shock. Although the cause of shock may not be initially apparent, treatment must begin immediately. A systematic approach to the evaluation of children with evidence of poor perfusion typically identifies features of the history, physical examination, and ancillary studies that suggest the etiology of the underlying condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81356\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81356 \">algorithm 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">No shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric patients with an acute, ongoing episode of tachycardia may have signs of cardiac disease even though shock is not present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58268\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58268 \">algorithm 4</a>). Typically, there is adequate time to obtain a 12-lead ECG and rhythm strip to categorize the QRS complex as narrow or wide. In addition, a 12 lead ECG obtained prior to and during any therapeutic interventions is essential because the data will allow thorough review of the event by a pediatric cardiologist and will affect long term decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Cardiac arrhythmias other than sinus tachycardia are rare in children. A past medical history of congenital heart disease, cardiac surgery, or a family history of sudden death significantly increases the likelihood of life-threatening atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wide complex tachycardia</strong> &ndash; In a stable patient with wide QRS complex tachycardia, the goals of the initial evaluation include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To determine if the wide QRS complex tachycardia originates from the ventricles, or is supraventricular with aberrant intraventricular conduction. The treatment and long term prognosis differs between children with VT versus those with SVT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To determine what therapeutic intervention(s) is required acutely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After determining the origin of the wide QRS complex tachycardia in the stable patient, treatment can be targeted to the specific arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-evaluation-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and evaluation of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)</strong> &ndash; SVT is characterized by a nonspecific history, absent P waves, no beat to beat variability, and a heart rate that is &ge;220 beats per minute in infants &lt;1 year of age and &ge;180 beats per minute in older children. Stable patients with SVT may initially undergo vagal maneuvers to convert to sinus rhythm. First line medical therapy consists of rapid intravenous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adenosine</a> (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. If the patient's rhythm cannot be readily determined because the P waves cannot be identified, it is reasonable to give a dose of adenosine while recording a rhythm strip for diagnostic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If the patient does not have a reentrant mechanism, the resultant slowing of the ventricular rate caused by adenosine will often allow for more specific identification of the P wave. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ill appearance</strong> &ndash; Ill-appearing patients with sinus tachycardia should be assessed for fever and pain. Febrile children warrant careful examination for physical findings of acute rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease, or sepsis. Severe hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis are seen following the endogenous catecholamine surge that occurs in patients with pheochromocytoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Well-appearing children with sinus tachycardia usually require no studies if the tachycardia abates with resolution of the suspected underlying cause (eg, a crying child with tachycardia who has a normal rate when quiet). A history of ingestion of caffeinated beverages, diet supplements, herbal preparations, over the counter sympathomimetic or anticholinergic medications, or illicit drugs identifies drug induced sinus tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66773 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Patients with pallor should have complete blood and reticulocyte counts drawn to identify and characterize anemia.
