The sodium plus potassium concentration in stool usually ranges between 130 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. Other cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are present at much lower concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main inorganic stool anions are bicarbonate (about 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L),</span> chloride (about 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L),</span> and a small amount of phosphate and sulfate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various organic acid anions (eg, propionate and butyrate, about 80 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> account for most of the anions in normal stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Organic acid anions represent &quot;decomposed bicarbonate&quot; and &quot;potential bicarbonate.&quot; When bicarbonate salts enter the colon and encounter organic acids, such as lactic and butyric acid, which have been produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates, the bicarbonate is titrated by the hydrogen ions to form CO2 and H2O (ie, decomposition of bicarbonate). What remain are sodium and potassium salts of the organic anions. These organic acid anions also represent &quot;potential bicarbonate&quot; because, if they are absorbed, they will be converted back to bicarbonate by the body. Thus, losing these organic anions in the stool as sodium or potassium salts has the same physiologic effect as losing sodium or potassium bicarbonate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stool water osmolality is similar to the osmolality of serum (approximately 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg)</span>. Although the stomach is capable of maintaining an osmotic gradient, more distal segments of the bowel are permeable to water, and therefore, the luminal contents have osmotically equilibrated with the serum by the time the fluid has passed the ligament of Treitz [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p/><p>It should be emphasized that, normally, only about 100 mL of water is excreted in the stool each day. Thus, despite the high stool electrolyte concentrations, only about 4 meq of sodium and 9 meq of potassium are lost in normal stool each day, and the total daily loss of bicarbonate plus organic acid anions is only about 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626692994\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND NON-ELECTROLYTE CONTENT OF DIARRHEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When diarrhea develops, stool osmolality remains similar to serum (about 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L)</span>. Depending upon the etiology of the diarrhea, osmotically active solutes in diarrheal stool may be electrolytes, magnesium salts, phosphate salts, and carbohydrates such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>, the bacterial fermentation products of these substances (ie, lactic, butyric, acetic acid, and others), large molecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), and combinations of these substances. Some forms of diarrhea may be primarily due to fat malabsorption (ie, steatorrhea); stool volumes in such patients are generally small but may increase markedly if the steatorrhea is also associated with carbohydrate malabsorption. </p><p>The origin of osmotically active molecules can be <strong>endogenous</strong>. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholera toxin or enteropathic E.

These ions are then eliminated with enough water to create stool with an osmolality of about 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span>. The diarrhea generated by <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (CDI) can also have a major secretory etiology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain tumors secrete hormones such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) that can cause marked gastrointestinal electrolyte secretion and massive watery diarrhea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mutation in a gastrointestinal chloride-bicarbonate exchanger causes the loss of endogenous chloride and a chloride-rich diarrhea (congenital chloridorrhea). </p><p/><p>The origin of stool molecules can also be <strong>exogenous</strong>.

Volume depletion will stimulate ADH secretion, and if excessive quantities of water are ingested, hyponatremia may develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of severe hypovolemia is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87267304\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common acid-base disorder that develops in patients with diarrhea is metabolic acidosis. Although some bicarbonate is present in stool, it is usually the loss of salts of organic acid anions (eg, propionate and butyrate) that is the most important cause of metabolic acidosis in patients with diarrhea. The loss of large quantities of Na or K salts of organic acid anions (which represent potential bicarbonate) is physiologically equivalent to losing equal quantities of Na or K bicarbonate. Because potential bicarbonate usually exceeds actual bicarbonate in diarrheal stool, the stool pH can be acidic. Thus, stool pH is generally of little importance in the determination of how diarrhea will impact systemic acid-base balance. A better index is the difference between the concentration of stool sodium plus potassium and the concentration of stool chloride Cl; this difference approximates the concentration of stool bicarbonate plus organic acid anion salts (potential bicarbonate). </p><p>Diarrhea caused by cholera is more commonly associated with high stool bicarbonate concentrations; the high volume of sodium bicarbonate-rich intestinal secretions occurs together with poor oral intake. Diminished oral intake limits carbohydrate delivery to the colon and thereby reduces the generation of bacterial fermentation products.</p><p>In addition to the loss of potential and actual bicarbonate salts, several other factors can contribute to the metabolic acidosis that develops in patients with diarrhea:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypovolemia will reduce the glomerular filtration rate and accelerate renal salt reabsorption. The resulting decrease in sodium delivery to the distal tubule can impair renal acid excretion.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>However, severe diarrhea with volume depletion can also cause a high anion gap acidosis as a result of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactic acidosis, which can result from decreased tissue perfusion when severe hypovolemia develops</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperphosphatemia, which can result from the combination of a reduced glomerular filtration rate and acidemia-induced release of intracellular phosphate into the extracellular fluid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced renal function can increase the concentration of other &quot;unmeasured&quot; anions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased serum albumin concentration, which can result from hemoconcentration; negative charges on albumin constitute a large part of the anion gap, and therefore, the higher albumin concentration elevates the anion gap</p><p/><p>Thus, in patients with diarrhea, the fall in the serum bicarbonate concentration may be partially balanced by a rise in chloride concentration and partially by a rise of the anion gap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Initially, urine pH falls and titratable acid excretion increases. If the acidosis persists, then renal ammonia synthesis and excretion also increase. In general, if the metabolic acidosis persists for more than several days, the ammonia excretory response to metabolic acidosis is greater than the increase in titratable acid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis#H529595797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine anion and osmolal gaps in metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Brief overview of renal acid excretion'</a>.)</p><p>If renal function and renal perfusion are normal, then the kidney can largely compensate for major losses of bicarbonate and potential bicarbonate that occur in patients with diarrhea. However, if the diarrhea generates hypovolemia, this will simultaneously reduce glomerular filtration and markedly enhance proximal renal tubule sodium and chloride reabsorption. The resulting decrease in distal tubule sodium chloride delivery reduces renal acid secretion and excretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The renal response to metabolic acidosis in patients with diarrhea can be evaluated by measuring the changes in creatinine concentration, the urine pH, and the urine sodium concentration. Sometimes, calculation of the urine anion or osmolal gap can be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H87267450\" class=\"local\">'Urine pH and urine ammonium and sodium concentrations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87267450\"><span class=\"h4\">Urine pH and urine ammonium and sodium concentrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute metabolic acidosis should normally increase distal tubule hydrogen ion secretion and reduce urine pH below 5.5. This does not occur in patients with distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis (RTA). However, an appropriate and normal response to chronic metabolic acidosis is a major increase in urine ammonium excretion, and this increases the urine pH. Chronic metabolic acidosis (and hypokalemia) increases renal tubule cell ammonia generation, and then diffusion of the ammonia (NH3) into the tubular lumen will drive the following reaction to the right, generating ammonium (NH4) and increasing the urine pH:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;NH3 &#160;+ &#160;H+ &#160; &lt;&mdash;&gt; &#160; NH4+</p></div></div><p>Thus, a relatively high urine pH does not necessarily indicate the existence of a renal acidification defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine anion and osmolal gaps in metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Urine anion gap'</a>.) </p><p>If the urine pH is relatively high (greater than 5.5) in a patient with diarrhea and metabolic acidosis, measurement or estimation of urine ammonium excretion can be used to determine whether or not the renal response is appropriate. The urine anion gap or the urine osmolal gap can be used to estimate the urine ammonium concentration. A high urine ammonium concentration is consistent with a normal renal response to metabolic acidosis, despite a high urine pH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-anion-and-osmolal-gaps-in-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine anion and osmolal gaps in metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the renal response to metabolic acidosis is inadequate, then the urine sodium concentration should be measured. If it is less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> inadequate distal sodium chloride delivery due to hypovolemia may be the cause of inadequate renal distal tubule acid secretion and excretion. The evaluation of renal acidification should be repeated after volume status has been restored. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87267311\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypokalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potassium concentration in stool water is usually relatively high, and large-volume diarrhea commonly results in hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can occur with all forms of diarrhea but is especially common with diarrhea due to cholera, certain pancreatic islet cell tumors (VIPomas), villous adenomas, and laxative abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/2,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7</a>]. Some patients with intestinal pseudo-obstruction secrete large amounts of potassium into the colonic fluid and develop marked hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Increased gastrointestinal losses'</a>.)</p><p>Two common causes of hyperchloremic (ie, normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia are diarrhea and proximal or distal tubule RTA. The hypokalemia of diarrhea is caused by stool potassium loss, while the hypokalemia of proximal or distal tubule RTA is due to renal potassium loss. Measurement of urinary potassium excretion may help to distinguish between gastrointestinal and renal losses of potassium (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with hypokalemia&quot;</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypokalemia that develops in patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to proximal or distal tubule RTA is largely due to renal potassium loss, and the urine potassium concentrations are generally greater than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, when hypokalemia is due to gastrointestinal loss, the kidney conserves potassium, and the urine potassium concentration is typically less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. One exception to this rule may occur when severe hypovolemia results in secondary hyperaldosteronism. The urine potassium concentration may then increase above 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. However, under those conditions, the urine volume will be low, and therefore, daily urinary potassium excretion will be quite low despite the relatively high potassium concentration. The daily potassium excretion rate can be measured with a 24-hour urine collection or estimated using the urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87267318\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypernatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea is sometimes due to the presence of non-electrolyte, osmotically active substances in the stool, such as carbohydrates or organic anion salts generated by bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates. This can occur in patients with malabsorption, or after ingestion of nonabsorbable carbohydrates such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>. In addition, ingestion of other non-carbohydrate, non-electrolyte substances such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can also generate diarrhea. These osmotically active substances obligate enough water to maintain the osmolality of the gastrointestinal lumen and stool at about 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span> (ie, similar to serum). </p><p>Since the osmolality of stool water in these conditions is largely due to non-electrolytes, the diarrhea represents the loss of electrolyte-free water. Large-volume diarrhea due to these mechanisms, with large electrolyte-free water loss, can generate hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/1-3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,9</a>]. However, the development of hypernatremia is uncommon in such patients if they have access to water and are able to respond normally to thirst. Hypernatremia may develop in those who do not experience or respond to thirst normally, such as patients with impaired mental status or infants who experience thirst but require others to provide fluid intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87267325\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic alkalosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although uncommon, some patients with diarrhea develop metabolic alkalosis rather than metabolic acidosis. This occurs in a rare disease called congenital chloride wasting diarrhea (congenital chloridorrhea) (see <a href=\"#H376829879\" class=\"local\">'Congenital chloride wasting diarrhea'</a> below). It can also develop in patients who chronically abuse laxatives. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Laxative abuse'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376829879\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital chloride wasting diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia occur in patients with congenital chloride wasting diarrhea (congenital chloridorrhea). This disorder is due to a mutation in a gene that encodes an exchange protein, expressed in the ileum and colon, which normally absorbs chloride from the intestinal lumen and secretes bicarbonate. </p><p>The mutation markedly reduces the activity of this chloride-bicarbonate exchanger and results in very high stool chloride concentrations (&gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span>. The stool chloride concentration generally exceeds the sum of the stool sodium and potassium concentrations. The difference between stool chloride and the sum of sodium and potassium consists of several cations, including ammonium (NH4) and organic cations. The excretion of chloride salts of NH4 and organic cations in the stool generates a systemic alkali load and results in metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These patients also become hypokalemic and potassium depleted because they lose potassium in the urine. The mechanism of urinary potassium loss in this disorder is similar to that responsible for the loss of urine potassium that occurs with vomiting and other gastric fluid losses.
