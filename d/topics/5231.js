Signs and symptoms of upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower respiratory tract involvement are present, along with indications of systemic illness such as fever, headache, myalgia, and weakness. Although acutely debilitating, influenza is typically a self-limited infection in otherwise healthy individuals. However, it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in certain high-risk populations.</p><p>In certain circumstances, the diagnosis of influenza can be made clinically, such as during an outbreak that has already been determined to be caused by influenza. At other times, it is important to establish the diagnosis quickly using laboratory testing, such as in the hospitalized patient with acute onset of severe pulmonary disease.</p><p>The diagnosis of seasonal influenza in adults will be reviewed here. Diagnosis of influenza in children is discussed separately. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, prevention, and treatment of seasonal influenza infection, as well as the diagnosis of avian influenza, are also reviewed elsewhere.

This was demonstrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective pooled analysis of signs and symptoms in 3744 adolescents and adults with an influenza-like illness who participated in phase II and III trials of neuraminidase inhibitors during outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the best multivariate predictor was the combination of fever and cough within 48 hours of the development of symptoms, which had a positive predictive value of 79 percent for documented influenza.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 100 children and adults with an influenza-like illness of &lt;72 hours duration in whom there was a prevalence of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection of 72 percent based upon viral culture and 79 percent based upon reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cough (odds ratio [OR] 6.7, 95% CI 1.4-34.1) and fever (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-8.0) were the only clinical factors associated with a positive RT-PCR result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H723343442\"><span class=\"h2\">Sporadic cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with the utility of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of influenza during outbreaks, sporadic cases of influenza cannot be differentiated from infections caused by other respiratory viruses on clinical grounds alone, and influenza virus infection may account for only a small number of such cases. In a review of 497 episodes of upper respiratory infection in older adult patients living in the community during the winters of 1992 to 1994, a pathogen was identified in 43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most common pathogens were rhinoviruses (52 percent) and coronaviruses (26 percent); influenza A or B viruses accounted for only 10 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H750934762\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adult patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have evaluated the use of clinical criteria for predicting the presence of influenza in older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In a systematic review, 16 studies that met inclusion criteria were selected to determine the precision and accuracy of symptoms and signs of influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among patients aged 60 years or older, fever (likelihood ratio [LR] 3.8, 95% CI 2.8-5.0), malaise (LR 2.6, 95% CI 2.2-3.1), or chills (LR 2.6, 95% CI 2.0-3.3) was the strongest univariate indicator of influenza. The combination of fever, cough, and acute onset (LR 5.4, 95% CI 3.8-7.7) or both fever and cough (LR 5.0, 95% CI 3.5-6.9) also increased the likelihood of influenza in the older age group. In contrast, the presence of sneezing made influenza less likely. The authors concluded that clinical findings are helpful but do not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of influenza.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1289544319\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section reviews the characteristics and performance of the various types of influenza tests. The approach to choosing a diagnostic test is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H2627651318\" class=\"local\">'Choice of diagnostic test'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3123094143\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and specific modality for diagnosing influenza infection, yields relatively rapid results, and differentiates between influenza types and subtypes (including pandemic H1N1 influenza, H5N1 avian influenza, and H7N9 avian influenza) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69655 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Although conventional RT-PCR takes only one to eight hours to perform, it often takes longer than this for results to be available since it may not be performed in-house or may be batched with other samples. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of avian influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PCR-based testing can detect low quantities of viral RNA in specimens such as nasopharyngeal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and nasal and throat swabs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69655 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a test kit that can identify influenza types and subtypes, including avian influenza A (H5N1), on upper and lower respiratory tract specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Rapid molecular assays have been developed, which provide results in &lt;20 minutes and at the point of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One type uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification and another type uses a modified RT-PCR. The rapid molecular assays can distinguish between influenza A and B but not among subtypes. In a meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic accuracy of influenza tests, rapid molecular assays had high sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with conventional RT-PCR, for influenza A viruses, the pooled sensitivity of rapid molecular assays was 92 percent versus 80 percent for digital immunoassays (DIAs) and 54 percent for traditional rapid antigen tests. For influenza B viruses, the pooled sensitivity of rapid molecular assays was 95 percent, versus 77 percent for DIAs and 53 percent for traditional rapid antigen tests.</p><p>A summary of available molecular assays for influenza viruses can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm&amp;token=EZ7dnPGG3Mf/pjeAyku2ub7S8LnnKQcqTpAazaQSeuXu8M2aMAH9YLvGfzCMOQdBCBoWbr/QajEZTOeYl3goLbVhmmlse4EFK/d1MO+PeXY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15871\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC's website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372035898\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid antigen tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional rapid influenza antigen tests are immunoassays that can identify influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The results of these tests are qualitative (positive or negative). Commercially available rapid antigen tests for influenza virus yield results in approximately 15 minutes or less but have <strong>much lower sensitivity</strong> than RT-PCR, rapid molecular assays, and viral culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69655 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/7,12,13,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,13,15-18</a>].

The sensitivity was lower in adults than in children (54 versus 67 percent) and was higher for influenza A than for influenza B (65 versus 52 percent). In a subsequent meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity was 54 percent for influenza A viruses and 53 percent for influenza B viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In a study that compared 11 rapid influenza antigen tests, most tests detected viral antigen at the highest concentrations but, at lower concentrations, detection varied by test as well as by virus type and subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These results suggest that rapid influenza antigen tests are likely to be most reliable early during the course of illness, when viral shedding is at its peak.</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-live-attenuated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">live attenuated influenza vaccine</a> (LAIV) can cause a false-positive result on a rapid influenza diagnostic test since these tests cannot differentiate between live attenuated and wild-type influenza viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Although viral culture has traditionally been the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis, it may take 48 to 72 hours or longer to see hemadsorption or the cytopathic effects of the virus in tissue culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Since viral culture does not yield timely results, it is <strong>not</strong> used for initial clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Rather, it is used for confirming screening tests and for public health surveillance. It can be used during periods of low influenza activity, especially in individuals who are epidemiologically linked to an influenza outbreak.
