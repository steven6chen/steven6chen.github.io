An important clinical feature is its tendency to arise within lymph node areas and to spread in an orderly fashion to contiguous areas of lymph nodes. Late in the course of the disease, vascular invasion leads to widespread hematogenous dissemination.</p><p>The initial evaluation of the patient with suspected HL is designed to provide information for diagnosis, prognosis, staging, and the selection of treatment. The components of this evaluation are reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathologic features, and staging of HL are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1444841376\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has a bimodal age distribution with one peak in the 20s and 30s, and a second peak over the age of 50. It accounts for approximately 10 percent of all lymphomas in economically advanced countries. The epidemiology of HL is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183236\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1444841395\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical presentation and disease tempo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) present with overt disease, most often as an asymptomatic enlarged lymph node or a mass on chest radiograph. However, the presenting symptoms and signs may be relatively nonspecific and more compatible with infection than malignant disease. Occult presentation of HL is unusual, but the incidence of clinically occult disease has been an important influence in the development of therapeutic strategies. </p><p>The disease tempo at presentation is variable. B symptoms (fever, night sweats) are present over weeks to months, though other symptoms such as fatigue or lymphadenopathy may be present over many months. Mediastinal masses can be quite large before resulting in discomfort or respiratory symptoms, suggesting that this is not a rapidly growing tumor. In patients being followed after treatment, evidence of recurrence can be seen on imaging within three to six months, but it may be longer before there is clinical evidence of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183242\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HL presents as a painless mass in approximately 70 percent of cases. The involved lymph node is usually nontender with a rubbery consistency. The most commonly involved site is in the neck, as 60 to 80 percent of patients have enlarged cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supraclavicular nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51115 \">table 1</a>). Enlarged nodes are found in the axilla in 10 to 20 percent of patients, and inguinal nodes are involved in 6 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Although not detectable on physical examination, the mediastinal nodes are involved in 60 to 70 percent of cases at presentation, and retroperitoneal nodes in 25 percent. Exclusive infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy is infrequent, occurring in less than 10 percent of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183291\"><span class=\"h2\">Mediastinal mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second common presentation is the discovery of a mediastinal mass on routine chest radiograph. The mass may be fairly large without producing local symptoms. Less commonly, the mass produces nonspecific symptoms such as retrosternal chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath. Small pericardial or pleural effusions are rare except in patients with bulky mediastinal disease. Superior vena caval obstruction is also rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with early stage disease, large mediastinal adenopathy (defined as more than one-third of the greatest intrathoracic diameter of the chest wall or 10 cm in transverse dimension) is an adverse prognostic factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183309\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant proportion of patients with HL develop systemic symptoms prior to the discovery of lymphadenopathy. Typical symptoms, called B symptoms, include fever (&gt;100.4&deg;F), night sweats, and weight loss. Fatigue and pruritus also may be seen, but are not classic B symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183315\"><span class=\"h3\">B symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B symptoms are present in less than 20 percent of patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> HL and up to 50 percent of patients with advanced disease. Among the latter, groups of patients who have B symptoms have a modest reduction in survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Systemic B symptoms have been formally defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Persistent temperature &gt;38&deg;C (&gt;100.4&deg;F)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; Unexplained loss of &gt;10 percent of body weight over the past six months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweats &ndash; The presence of drenching night sweats</p><p/><p>Fever is similar to that associated with infection; it is more noticeable in the evening and becomes more severe and continuous with time. Pel-Ebstein fever is the characteristic, although uncommon, intermittent fever associated with HL. It recurs at variable intervals of several days or weeks and lasts for one to two weeks before waning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183349\"><span class=\"h3\">Pruritus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pruritus may be an important early symptom, preceding the diagnosis of HL by months or even a year or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pruritus occurs early in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients, but many patients experience pruritus at some time during the course of illness. It is usually generalized and occasionally severe enough to cause intense scratching and excoriations. Severe, but not mild, pruritus is a poor prognostic sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183383\"><span class=\"h2\">Other nonspecific symptoms and paraneoplastic syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In occasional patients, HL presents with one of a variety of nonspecific symptoms reflecting organ involvement or paraneoplastic syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78183389\"><span class=\"h3\">Intra-abdominal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy may give rise to discomfort and pain in the paravertebral or loin regions, particularly in the supine position.

Noncontiguous spread and hematologic distribution are more common with recurrent disease. It is likely that HL can spread via the thoracic duct, possibly in either direction, without clinical involvement of the mediastinum.</p><p>Clinical studies of disease distribution have supported this concept, particularly in younger patients with classic histologic subtypes of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

This was illustrated in a detailed study of 719 patients with HL who underwent staging laparotomy; the following patterns were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL presented with localized peripheral disease often in the upper neck, whereas patients with the lymphocyte depleted subtype usually presented with abdominal nodal involvement and often have extranodal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with nodular sclerosis histology had disease above the diaphragm and mediastinal node involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease in the liver was most often seen in patients with the mixed cellularity or lymphocyte depleted subtypes and systemic symptoms.</p><p/><p>Lymphocyte-depleted classical HL is the least common subtype of classical HL and accounts for less than 1 percent of cases.

A lymph node is preferred with a whole lymph node obtained, if possible. Inguinal nodes should not be biopsied if equally suspicious peripheral nodes are present elsewhere because of frequent inflammation in this area. When the diagnosis of HL is made from biopsy of an extranodal site, confirmation by lymph node biopsy is desirable unless the diagnosis is considered unequivocal.

Modern RT techniques use strategies to limit doses to normal tissue and restrict treatment to the initially involved nodes. </p><p>Fusion of staging 18F-FDG PET with radiation planning CT improves target delineation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Involved-node RT (INRT) requires that the pre-chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> be obtained with the patient in the RT position, using the planned immobilization device and the same respiratory instructions. However, this may not be feasible under most circumstances, and involved-site RT (ISRT) accommodates cases in which optimal prechemotherapy imaging is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Although PET scanning is not an absolute indicator of initial disease involvement or of cure after chemotherapy alone, a pre-treatment PET scan is helpful in the initial staging. Studies are in progress to determine the usefulness of PET scanning to guide therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-and-after-treatment#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring of the patient with classical Hodgkin lymphoma during and after treatment&quot;, section on 'PET/CT scan'</a>.) </p><p>Involvement of the following organs may require special consideration as they may be difficult to interpret:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spleen &ndash; The CT scan provides detailed information about the liver and spleen, but it is still difficult to reliably diagnose splenic involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one series in which staging laparotomy was the gold standard, the overall accuracy of CT detection for splenic involvement was 58 percent (sensitivity 33 percent, and specificity 76 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Detecting microscopic involvement in the spleen is now less important as nearly all patients will receive systemic chemotherapy as part of their treatment course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver &ndash; Hepatic involvement occurs in approximately 5 percent of cases of HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Involvement usually consists of microscopic or small macroscopic foci, making radiologic diagnosis difficult. In one report, for example, the livers of 13 patients with histologically proven hepatic lymphoma were evaluated with both MRI and CT; radiologic testing demonstrated a focal abnormality in only one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Other studies have found greater sensitivity of MRI for the detection of hepatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Biochemical tests of the liver are also not reliable, since they may be abnormal in the absence of histological involvement. For these reasons, the current Cotswolds guidelines recommend that the radiologic diagnosis of hepatic involvement requires the demonstration of multiple focal defects (not cystic or vascular) by at least two imaging techniques, such as CT scanning, isotope scanning, ultrasonography, or MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone &ndash; Bone disease at presentation is uncommon but occurs at some time in the course of the disease in up to 20 percent of patients with HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Bone lesions on plain films are predominantly osteoblastic (sclerotic), although variations may be present in individual cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54124 \">table 4</a>). PET scans are highly sensitive for the identification of bony involvement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal tract &ndash; The gastrointestinal tract is a common site of extranodal infiltration in non-Hodgkin lymphoma but is rarely involved in HL. If indicated, endoscopy and biopsy are the preferred choice to confirm suspected involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system &ndash; Central nervous system involvement with HL is rare. It can present either with intracranial disease or with spinal, extranodal deposits. If suspected, the diagnosis can be readily established with plain radiography, CT scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging, and cytology of the cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study of cardiac ejection fraction (eg, echocardiogram or MUGA) should be performed if the patient is likely to be treated with an anthracycline.

In addition, extensive disease within the chest and anemia may lead to abnormal baseline values.

These presentations include generalized pruritus, symptoms related to retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, cholestatic liver disease, alcohol-induced pain, skin lesions, neurologic symptoms, nephrotic syndrome, hypercalcemia, and abnormalities in blood counts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HL starts at a single site within the lymphatic system, usually a lymph node, and then progresses to adjacent lymph nodes via lymphatic channels before disseminating to distant nonadjacent sites and organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of the patient with HL is designed to provide information for diagnosis, prognosis, staging, and the selection of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The history should determine the presence or absence, duration, and severity of systemic symptoms that may be associated with HL such as unexplained fever, sweating, particularly at night, weight loss, pruritus, and alcohol-induced pain. Additional inquiries should include prior history of malignancy and associated treatments, immunosuppressive illnesses, and performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785%7EHEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 graphicRef72901 \">table 2A-B</a>).
