When people have a skull or facial fracture, they have broken one or more bones of their skull (head) or face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62443 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Skull and facial fractures can happen when people are hit hard on their head or face. Common causes of skull and facial fractures are falls, car accidents, and sports injuries.</p><p>There are different kinds of fractures, depending on how the bone breaks. Some fractures are more serious than others. If the bone is only cracked, the fracture is usually not as serious. But if part of the bone is pushed in toward the brain, the fracture is more serious.</p><p>Skull and facial fractures sometimes lead to serious problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain damage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in or on top of the brain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection of the tissues around the brain and spinal cord</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make people pass out, or move or behave strangely.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9538884\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a skull or facial fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can be mild or severe, depending on where the fracture is and how serious it is. Possible symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, swelling, or bleeding &ndash; Sometimes, it takes a day for the swelling to start.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired, confused, or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising around the eyes, or behind the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the nose or ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear fluid draining from the nose or ear &ndash; This is spinal fluid, the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble smelling, hearing, or seeing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness or numbness of the face</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9538899\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a skull or facial fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor will ask about the symptoms and injury, and do an exam. To look for a fracture, he or she can do a CT scan of the head. This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the skull and brain.</p><p>The doctor might also do skull X-rays or other imaging tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9538914\"><span class=\"h1\">How are skull and facial fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of fracture and where it is.</p><p>Many people will not need any treatment. If the skull bone only cracks but doesn't move out of place, people usually don't need treatment. But their doctor will watch them to follow their symptoms.</p><p>People whose symptoms go away after a short time can usually leave the hospital after a few hours. But the doctor will probably recommend that someone watch them at home for 24 hours to make sure their symptoms don't get worse.</p><p>People who have a serious fracture, or symptoms that get worse or don't go away, will need to stay in the hospital for a longer time. Depending on their fracture, people might be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines to prevent infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-seizure medicines to prevent seizures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccines &ndash; Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9538929\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the person with the fracture leaves the hospital, call the doctor or nurse if he or she has:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A headache that won't go away</p><p/><p>You should bring the person back to the hospital immediately if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a severe headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a seizure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble walking, talking, or seeing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has weakness or numbness in his or her body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isn't acting like him- or herself</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has blood or fluid leaking from the nose or ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passes out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9538944\"><span class=\"h1\">What can people do to help prevent skull and facial fractures?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help prevent skull and facial fractures, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a helmet when you ride a bike or motorcycle, or play certain sports.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a seat belt every time you drive or ride in a car.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9538959\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Concussion in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertigo-a-type-of-dizziness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertigo (a type of dizziness) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-head-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Closed head injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nose-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nose fracture (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
