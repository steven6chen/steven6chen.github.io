Early risk assessment and diagnosis of fetal abnormalities allows the couple maximum time for decision making; privacy, since others may not be aware of the pregnancy; and, if chosen, safer methods of pregnancy termination. Less obvious are potential disadvantages, including the diagnosis of a fetus with Down syndrome that would have been spontaneously lost (about 15 percent of all Down syndrome pregnancies are spontaneously lost between 11 and 16 weeks of gestation compared with less than 2 percent of euploid pregnancies) and the potential that the woman's support network may be more limited early in pregnancy.</p><p>First-trimester Down syndrome screening is done in the late first trimester, between 9<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> and 13<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> </sup>weeks of gestation, depending on which markers are used (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Timing of blood sample and ultrasound'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The first-trimester screening test consists of three markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency (NT)</p><p/><p>These three markers comprise the &quot;combined test&quot; and together with maternal age provide a patient-specific risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The combined test detects approximately 85 percent of Down syndrome (ie, detection rate [DR] = sensitivity = 85 percent) with a false positive rate (FPR) of 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/3,7-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-16</a>].

Its levels, on average, are lower in pregnancies affected with fetal Down syndrome. In contrast to beta-hCG, PAPP-A performance as a screening marker decreases with increasing gestational age between 9 and 13 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/8,17,18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,18,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16165460\"><span class=\"h3\">Nuchal translucency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal NT thickness measured between 10<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">3/7ths</sup></span> and 13<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup></span> gestational weeks is, on average, increased in fetuses with Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/9,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23,24</a>]. NT performance as a screening marker decreases with advancing gestation between 10 and 13 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/18,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25,26</a>]. The most commonly used cut-offs to classify nuchal translucency as abnormal are the 95th and 99th percentiles for gestational age. Various calculators are available online that enable a clinician to enter the fetal crown rump length and nuchal translucency measurement to obtain the estimated gestational age and percentile for nuchal translucency. </p><p>Performance of NT as a screening marker has not been consistent from study to study, presumably because of variability in operator expertise and quality of equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. For this reason, proper training and ongoing quality management are essential components of screening programs that involve measurement of nuchal translucency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic hygroma and increased nuchal translucency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The best interpretation of NT is by screening programs that combine its measurement with maternal age and first trimester serum markers to provide a patient specific risk of Down syndrome. One exception to this recommendation is for fetuses with a cystic hygroma or significantly enlarged nuchal translucency. These pregnancies are at particularly high risk of aneuploidy. Many experts proceed directly to karyotype (some choose microarray) assessment in these cases, rather than checking maternal serum analyte levels. The optimum threshold for proceeding to chromosomal analysis without maternal serum screening is unclear. Nuchal translucency thresholds in the range of 3.0 to 4.0 mm have been suggested, given the relatively high risk of Down syndrome at this level. Enlarged nuchal translucency has also been associated with other structural malformations. This topic is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic hygroma and increased nuchal translucency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107527319\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER FIRST-TRIMESTER SCREENING TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The performance of the first-trimester combined test can be enhanced by adding placental growth factor (PlGF) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to the combined test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. PIGF and AFP levels are, on average, lower in pregnancies affected with fetal Down syndrome. Although not in clinical use, several studies have shown that a combination of four serum markers (PIGF, AFP, beta-HCG, PAPP-A) between 11 and 13 completed weeks of gestation can detect up to 90 percent of Down syndrome pregnancies, but with a false positive rate of about 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,32</a>]. Such testing would only be reasonable with reflexive cell free DNA testing for those with initial screen-positive results, and may be useful in areas where NT is unreliable, unavailable, or too costly for routine use. Inhibin-A is also an effective Down syndrome marker between 11<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>and 13<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup></span> gestational weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/7,8,17,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,17,33</a>]. Its levels are, on average, elevated in pregnancies affected with Down syndrome. At this time, however, only a few programs use inhibin A in first-trimester Down syndrome screening.</p><p>First-trimester combined screening can also be improved by using two or three additional ultrasound markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Disadvantages include the additional expertise and costs involved. Additional markers are described separately.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INTEGRATED TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integrated screening uses markers measured in both the first and second trimesters to provide a single estimate of risk for Down syndrome pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224005123\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of blood samples and ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first trimester, a serum sample is assayed for PAPP-A between 9 and 13 completed weeks and an ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency (NT), along with estimation of gestational age by crown-rump length, is performed between 10 and 13 completed weeks. The information is kept on file until a second-trimester serum sample is drawn and the quadruple test markers are run (alpha fetoprotein [AFP], unconjugated estriol [uE3], inhibin A and beta-hCG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76911\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76911 \">table 1</a>). Beta-hCG can be used as a marker in either the first or second trimester, but is routinely measured in the second trimester when its performance is better.</p><p>The six marker values are used, together with maternal age, to calculate a single risk for Down syndrome and a report is generated. The integrated test achieves an 85 percent detection rate (DR) at a 1 percent false positive rate (FPR). If a 90 percent DR is the target, the FPR will be 2 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The advantage of the integrated test is that at an equivalent DR, it has a substantially lower FPR than the combined or quadruple test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A reduction in the FPR in screening tests is highly desirable. Any reduction in false positives while maintaining a high DR will increase the safety of the screening process because there will be fewer procedure-related miscarriages per Down syndrome pregnancy identified. A lower FPR will also decrease the number of patients who are anxious due to a false positive result; such anxiety appears to decrease participation in Down syndrome screening in the next pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The disadvantage of the integrated test is that final test results are not available until the second trimester. This problem can be largely mitigated by using a sequential approach, either step-wise or contingent (see below).</p><p>Like the combined test, the integrated test can also detect trisomy 18, which is associated with a different pattern of test results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71552\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71552 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Detection of trisomy 18'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum integrated test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum integrated test is the same as the full integrated test, but without ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency. This test provides an option to patients in areas where expertise in measurement of nuchal translucency is not available. It has the highest detection rate among screening tests that do not include nuchal translucency measurement or cell free DNA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Step-wise sequential screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The step-wise sequential screening process involves performing the first-trimester portion of the integrated screen and then offering counseling and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) to women whose results place them at very high risk (eg, &ge;1 in 50, or about the highest 0.5 percent) of an affected fetus. Women whose screen does not place them at very high risk do not receive early results and go on to complete the second-trimester portion of the test. The rationale for not releasing first-trimester risk results to patients in the group with risks less than the cut-off is that this information may lead to diagnostic testing in those not at very high risk and increase the observed FPR of the step-wise sequential test without a substantial increase in detection. Many women with somewhat elevated risks in the first trimester will have quite low risks once the results of second-trimester testing are included.</p><p>One investigator estimated an 86 percent DR was achieved at a 2 percent FPR in a step-wise sequential test in which the first-trimester cut-off for offering invasive testing was set at 1 in 40 and the integrated cut-off was set at 1 in 110 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the FASTER trial discussed below, step-wise sequential screening detected 95 percent of Down syndrome fetuses with a FPR of 5 percent (2.5 percent in the first-trimester portion and 2.5 percent in the integrated portion of the test) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These rates approach those of full integrated screening, but have the benefit of availability of early results for the highest risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Issues related to this type of step-wise sequential testing have been reviewed elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39</a>]. </p><p>Reporting a first-trimester Down syndrome risk and a separate and independent second-trimester Down syndrome risk is relatively common, but has important disadvantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The problems of independent sequential screening were illustrated in a multicenter study of the first-trimester combined test sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Independent first and second-trimester sequential testing (the results of first-trimester screening were not incorporated into the total risk assessment) resulted in a very high detection rate (overall about 98 percent), but at an inappropriately high FPR (about 17 percent). Reporting both risks leads to physician and patient confusion and unpredictable screening performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TEST PERFORMANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Serum, Urine and Ultrasound Screening Study (SURUSS) and First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk (FASTER) trial evaluated Down syndrome screening in both the first and second trimesters of the same woman. A summary of results from these trials, including false positive rates (FPRs) for various detection rates (DRs), is provided in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348 \">table 3</a>).

The rate of procedure-related unaffected fetal loss would be 9 per 100,000 women screened compared with about 45 per 100,000 women such losses when either the combined test or the second-trimester quadruple test is performed.

Twenty-five maternity units, primarily in the United Kingdom, collected data on over 47,000 screened singleton pregnancies, including 101 affected by Down syndrome. All NT data were analyzed, and nested case control sample sets were developed for analysis of all possible serum and urine markers and combinations.</p><p>At a DR of 85 percent, the false positive rate (0.9 percent) was lowest for the first- and second-trimester fully integrated test (includes NT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348 \">table 3</a>).

The finding of septated cystic hygroma in the first trimester was associated with a 50 percent risk of aneuploidy. Nuchal translucency &ge;3 mm was associated with a 17 percent risk of aneuploidy, therefore, these findings warranted immediate diagnostic work-up.

This can be explained to the patient as, &quot;Your screening test result for Down syndrome is 1 in 90, meaning that among a group of 90 women with this test result, one will have a fetus with Down syndrome, while the remaining 89 will not.&quot; It is important to note whether the risks reported are at term (chance of a liveborn infant with Down syndrome), at mid-trimester (the chance that an amniocentesis will identify and affected fetus) or in the late first trimester (chance that a CVS will identify an affected fetus). For example, a term risk of 1 in 90 translates to a mid-trimester risk of about 1 in 68 and a late first trimester risk of 1 in 61. These differences reflect the ongoing fetal loss associated with Down syndrome pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A screen-positive test result indicates that the woman's risk of having a child with Down syndrome is equal to, or exceeds, a specific cut-off level that was predetermined by the laboratory based on the performance characteristics of the chosen screening test. This cut-off level is <span class=\"nowrap\">program/laboratory-specific</span> and based on the combination of markers used, among other factors. A typical cut-off for the combined test is the term risk of Down syndrome of &ge;1 in 300. This is associated with a false positive rate (FPR) of about 5 percent (eg, about 5 per 100 women will have risks higher than 1 in 300 &ndash; such as 1 in 250 or 1 in 75). The odds of Down syndrome in this group of women is about 1 in 20 (eg, for every 20 women screen-positive, 1 will have a Down syndrome fetus and 19 will have a normal fetus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54782 \">table 4</a>).

This would include information about the natural history of Down syndrome. Nondirective information enables the parents to balance the risks, limitations, and benefits of prenatal screening and diagnostic testing with the medical, educational and social issues involved in raising a child with Down syndrome or pregnancy termination.</p><p>Women with positive screening results are offered definitive fetal chromosomal analysis (karyotype) by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) if they present prior to 14 weeks of gestation. First-trimester combined and stepwise sequential testing should not be offered if CVS is unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Alternatively, they may choose to undergo secondary screening using a maternal plasma-based test for cell free DNA. Although not diagnostic, the high sensitivity and specificity of the DNA test will reassure many of these women that their risk of having a Down syndrome pregnancy is very low, which allows them to avoid the risk associated with an invasive diagnostic test. Among those women with a positive DNA test, the risk of Down syndrome is increased, but still requires confirmation by an invasive diagnostic test (eg, amniocentesis to obtain amniocytes for karyotyping).

The cut-off chosen for screen-positive in the integrated test is often higher than that of the combined or quadruple test in order to obtain this test's low FPR while still maintaining a high detection rate. A typical cut-off for the integrated test is a midpregnancy risk of Down syndrome of &ge;1 in 100. This cut-off is associated with a FPR of 1 to 2 percent and odds of Down syndrome among the screen-positive women is about 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54782 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The same counseling issues that apply to women with first-trimester screen-positive results are applicable to those with a screen-positive integrated test result, except that amniocentesis is the diagnostic test offered instead of CVS since the screening result is provided in the early second trimester.

Ninety-five percent of affected infants die within the first year of life, 50 percent die within the first week.

The single false negative case was screen-positive for trisomy 21. Thus, screening identified 91 percent of the 11 cases of trisomy 18, with a FPR of 2 percent using a risk cut-off of 1 in 150. Of course, due to the high spontaneous loss rate in affected pregnancies, some missed cases might spontaneously abort and never be identified as a false negative. In the FASTER trial, 9 of 15 (60 percent) of trisomy 18 cases were identified using a first-trimester algorithm, at a 0.1 percent FPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>In screening for trisomy 18, it is appropriate to keep the FPR very low (less than 0.5 percent) so that only a small number of very high risk women will be offered invasive diagnostic testing to detect a fetal abnormality that is often spontaneously lost and that among liveborns is almost always lethal.

It is commonly performed at 11<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 13<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup></span> weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'First-trimester combined test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The combined test detects 85 percent of Down syndrome fetuses at a 5 percent false positive rate (FPR). It is slightly more efficient than the &quot;quadruple test&quot; (ie, it has a slightly higher detection rate and a slightly lower FPR), but less efficient than the &quot;integrated test.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The combined test is most appropriate for patients who place a higher value on identifying Down syndrome during the first trimester than on the risk of procedure-related pregnancy loss from invasive diagnostic testing (chorionic villus sampling).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The full integrated test (first-trimester nuchal translucency, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A [PAPP-A] plus second-trimester quadruple markers) detects 85 percent of Down syndrome fetuses at a 1 percent FPR. If a 90 percent detection rate is the target, the FPR will be 2 percent. Results are available in the second trimester and amniocentesis is offered to screen-positive patients for definitive diagnosis. Alpha fetoprotein screening for neural tube defects is included as one of the second-trimester quadruple test marker. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Integrated tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The full integrated is most appropriate for patients who place a higher value on minimizing the risk of procedure-related pregnancy loss from invasive diagnostic testing than on first-trimester identification of an affected pregnancy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequential integrated tests allow for the majority of Down syndrome cases to be identified in the first trimester while having only a slight reduction in performance.

A negative secondary screen reduces the proportion of women going on to invasive testing by &ge;90 percent, but a positive screen must be confirmed by invasive testing.
