At the cellular level, shock results from insufficient delivery of required metabolic substrates, principally oxygen, to sustain aerobic metabolism.</p><p>In the setting of trauma, loss of circulating blood volume from hemorrhage is the most common cause of shock. Inadequate oxygenation, mechanical obstruction (eg, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax), neurologic dysfunction (eg, high-spinal cord injury), and cardiac dysfunction represent other potential causes or contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Shock is a common and frequently treatable cause of death in injured patients and is second only to brain injury as the leading cause of death from trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient, focusing on recognition of shock, basic initial management, and acute interventions needed to treat non-hemorrhagic causes of shock. General management of the adult trauma patient, management of hemorrhagic shock, and other aspects of shock, including the pathophysiology and differential diagnosis, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of shock primarily relates to an imbalance in oxygen supply and demand. Patients in shock suffer from a critical reduction in the oxygen available to the mitochondria. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Adenosine</a> triphosphate (ATP) can still be synthesized by anaerobic glycolysis but at only 5 to 10 percent of the normal rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Anaerobic glycolysis results in the accumulation of pyruvate, which is converted to lactate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The pathophysiology of shock is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The compensatory physiologic responses to acute hemorrhage attempt to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in an increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, and increased ventricular contractility. As the shock state progresses, vital organ (eg, brain and heart) perfusion can only be maintained at the expense of nonvital organs. If the process is not reversed, progressive lactate production leads to worsening systemic metabolic acidosis, which along with hypoxemia ultimately causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction and cardiovascular collapse.</p><p>The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) manual describes four classes of hemorrhage to emphasize the early signs of the shock state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clinicians should note that significant drops in blood pressure are generally not manifested until class III hemorrhage develops, and up to 30 percent of a patient's blood volume can be lost before this occurs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class I hemorrhage involves a blood volume loss of up to 15 percent. The heart rate is minimally elevated or normal, and there is no change in blood pressure, pulse pressure, or respiratory rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II hemorrhage occurs when there is a 15 to 30 percent blood volume loss and is manifested clinically as tachycardia (heart rate of 100 to 120), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 20 to 24), and a decreased pulse pressure, although systolic blood pressure changes minimally if at all. The skin may be cool and clammy, and capillary refill may be delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class III hemorrhage involves a 30 to 40 percent blood volume loss, resulting in a significant drop in blood pressure and changes in mental status. Any hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) or drop in blood pressure greater than 20 to 30 percent of the measurement at presentation is cause for concern. While diminished anxiety or pain may contribute to such a drop, the clinician must assume it is due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise. Heart rate (&ge;120 and thready) and respiratory rate are markedly elevated, while urine output is diminished. Capillary refill is delayed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class IV hemorrhage involves more than 40 percent blood volume loss leading to significant depression in blood pressure and mental status. Most patients in class IV shock are hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg). Pulse pressure is narrowed (&le;25 mmHg), and tachycardia is marked (&gt;120). Urine output is minimal or absent. The skin is cold and pale, and capillary refill is delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> is the most common cause of shock in the trauma patient. Massive hemorrhage can occur in the chest, abdomen, retroperitoneum, and from major external wounds. The thigh can hold up to approximately 1 to 2 L of blood. Scalp lacerations can bleed profusely and are often overlooked if significant thoracic or abdominal injuries are present, or because significant blood loss occurred in the field. The initial and subsequent management of the adult trauma patient with significant bleeding are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of other potential causes of traumatic shock must also be considered, including (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63698 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F99574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99574 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tension pneumothorax (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary injury'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary contusion with resulting pulmonary dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemothorax with resulting pulmonary dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial infarction or contusion (ie, cardiogenic shock) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord injury (ie, neurogenic shock) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury#H25317479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular complications'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effects of pharmacologic or toxicologic agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fat or air embolism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-embolism-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fat embolism syndrome&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>In penetrating trauma, diaphragmatic rupture complicated by incarceration of abdominal organs and bowel perforation can lead to septic shock.

Ideally, shock is recognized before hypotension develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The clinical presentation of traumatic shock depends on the rate, volume, and duration of bleeding, the patient's baseline physiology, and the presence of other acute pathologic processes (eg, tension pneumothorax, myocardial ischemia). In severe trauma, patients often sustain more than one injury that contributes to the development of shock.</p><p>Obvious and immediately detectable manifestations of the shock state include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia (note that neurogenic shock may present with bradycardia) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool extremities (note that neurogenic shock may present with warm extremities)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak peripheral pulses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged capillary refill (&gt;2 seconds)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowing of the pulse pressure (&lt;25 mmHg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered mental status not due to head injury (may range from coma to agitation) </p><p/><p><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> is the most common cause of shock in the adult trauma patient. Large-scale bleeding can occur at five possible locations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External hemorrhage (eg, scalp laceration, open fracture site)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroperitoneal space (often from pelvic fracture)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle or subcutaneous tissue (often from a long-bone fracture)</p><p/><p>When the cause of shock is not obvious, evaluation and treatment occur in tandem. A trauma ultrasound examination, or Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST), is performed early in the assessment to look for hemopericardium, intraabdominal bleeding, and pneumothorax. Performance of the FAST examination is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The three standard initial trauma radiographs include the chest, pelvis, and lateral cervical spine, although depending upon the hospital and the clinical scenario clinicians may forego plain radiographs in favor of computed tomography (CT), particularly if CT scanners are immediately available and adjacent to the trauma bay. Of the standard plain radiographs, the portable chest radiograph is most likely to reveal an injury requiring immediate intervention. Remember that the presence of one injury in no way excludes the possibility of other, more serious injuries.</p><p>Shock may exist even in the setting of &quot;normal&quot; vital signs, making diagnosis potentially difficult. In the setting of significant trauma, remain skeptical of apparently normal vital signs. Young patients without underlying comorbidities can maintain a blood pressure within the normal range despite substantial blood loss through compensatory vasoconstriction and increases in heart rate, only to decompensate acutely sometime later. A bradycardic response to penetrating intraperitoneal injury, which may be vagally mediated, has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, a paradoxical or relative bradycardia has been described in hypoperfusing trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A retrospective review of more than 1700 trauma patients that compared presenting heart rate with base deficits and lactate concentrations reported that the absence of tachycardia in the presence of hypoperfusion is associated with a poor prognosis independent of injury severity, systolic blood pressure, and head injury. </p><p>Recognizing shock in its early stages is more difficult, but provides clinicians the opportunity for early reversal of end-organ hypoperfusion. Serial examinations and serial ultrasound studies can help to identify occult injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The importance of reassessing patients who appear &quot;stable&quot; initially following significant trauma cannot be overstated. Subtle changes in vital signs and physical findings are best detected by serial examinations and may offer the earliest clues to the presence of significant injury. While not all patients need to be observed for extended periods, worsening vital signs (eg, increase in heart or respiratory rate), concerning changes in the physical examination, or any sense that something just doesn't feel or look right demands close attention and observation until the suspected injury becomes apparent or the source of concern resolves.</p><p>Alterations in mental status caused by hypoperfusion may be subtle initially and can be difficult to distinguish from drug or alcohol intoxication or associated head injury. Altered mental status on presentation or a subsequent decline in mental status, particularly in patients without obvious evidence of head injury, should raise suspicion for cerebral hypoperfusion. In young, otherwise healthy patients, subtle alterations, such as agitation, confusion, irritability, indifference to surroundings, or inattention to instructions, may be the only sign of early shock. A patient who is aggravating you or your staff may be showing early signs of shock, not the effects of intoxication. Be extremely cautious before attributing abnormal vital signs or physical examination findings to nontraumatic causes. </p><p>Subtle examination findings may provide evidence of early shock. Pallor or poor capillary refill may represent peripheral vasoconstriction. Diaphoresis may indicate physiologic stress and appear before vital sign abnormalities. Mild tachypnea may reflect compensation for metabolic acidosis. Low-urine output may indicate inadequate visceral perfusion. Patients who are unable to maintain a urine output greater than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour and have a high-urine specific gravity may be compensating for hypovolemia.</p><p>Elder adult patients are more likely to take medications (eg, beta blockers) that affect the hemodynamic response to injury and are more likely to have baseline hypertension. It is important to interpret vital signs with the patient's baseline in mind [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The emergency clinician may need to predict this physiologic baseline based on age and other available information (eg, medication list). As an example, a systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg may be dangerously low in a patient with underlying hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Non-hemorrhagic causes of traumatic shock may demonstrate typical presentations, but often do not. As an example, pericardial tamponade is classically described as exhibiting Beck's triad of hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds, but these are late findings, when present at all. If significant, ongoing hemorrhage exists or the pericardium periodically decompresses by emptying blood into the pleural space, tamponade can occur without distended neck veins. Ultrasound examination (and possibly re-examination) is critical. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Immediate interventions to manage non-hemorrhagic shock'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Pericardial and limited cardiac examination'</a>.)</p><p>A large pneumothorax or hemothorax may be detected clinically by the appearance of respiratory distress, unilateral diminished breath sounds, or air crepitus on palpation. Ultrasound is an important tool for recognizing pneumothorax, particularly in the unstable patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174543\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Pleural examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the stable patient with suspected pneumothorax, confirmation by chest radiograph is prudent; in the unstable patient, immediate treatment with needle decompression or rapid chest tube placement is necessary and must not be delayed for radiography. The classic description of a tension pneumothorax includes ipsilateral absent breath sounds, deviation of the trachea away from the affected side, and hypotension from inadequate preload due to compression of the inferior vena cava. Tracheal deviation and hypotension occur late. Animal studies suggest hypoxemia may be an earlier sign of tension pneumothorax than hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Needle chest decompression'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neurogenic shock may develop in the patient with a high-spinal cord injury. Neurologic deficits may not be apparent in the unresponsive patient, but are usually obvious otherwise, as patients manifest some combination of a loss of reflexes, motor function, and sensation distal to the level of the spinal cord injury. Hypotension, which may be mild in these patients, results from the loss of peripheral vascular resistance. Tachycardia is absent because of the loss of sympathetic tone. Hypotension associated with neurologic deficits and the absence of peripheral vasoconstriction (these patients often have warm extremities and good urine output) raises suspicion for neurogenic shock. Volume status must be closely monitored because excess fluid administration may be harmful. Hypotension should not be attributed solely to neurologic injury until hemorrhagic shock has been ruled out. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following any patient transfer to a new stretcher or any invasive procedure (eg, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, placement of central venous catheter), be aware that complications may contribute to shock. As an example, inadvertent puncture of a lung during central line placement in an intubated patient may produce a tension pneumothorax. Endotracheal and thoracostomy tubes can become dislodged or obstructed when a patient is moved. It is prudent to reassess all patients after such a move, and certainly with any change in their condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2019650085\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prehospital management of patients in traumatic shock is focused on recognition, rapid transport, and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Prehospital clinicians must be diligent about looking for signs of hypoperfusion, ideally recognizing traumatic shock before hypotension develops, and providing appropriate management according to their level of skill. Delayed fluid resuscitation for penetrating trauma remains controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H3100049699\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Delayed fluid resuscitation/controlled hypotension'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3885661387\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic approach and initial interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of the adult trauma patient in shock is focused on the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognizing and reversing life-threatening injuries (eg, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade) immediately. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restoring intravascular volume if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventing or limiting ongoing blood loss.</p><p/><p>Assessment and treatment are performed simultaneously in the seriously injured patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76631\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76631 \">algorithm 1</a>).

While clamping bleeding vessels under direct visualization is acceptable when necessary, blind clamping should <strong>NOT</strong> be performed. Scalp lacerations can bleed profusely and are often overlooked if significant thoracic or abdominal injuries are present. Scalp lacerations can be managed by injecting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with epinephrine directly into the wound, by placing clips (eg, Raney clips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52581 \">picture 1</a>)), or by closing the wound with running (ie, noninterrupted) or running locked stitches using heavy suture. Running or interrupted sutures may also be used to control severe bleeding from extremity wounds when direct pressure is inadequate and the few available clinicians must perform other important interventions for an unstable trauma patient.</p><p>Use of a tourniquet is acceptable to stop hemorrhage in cases of amputation or severe extremity injury when other measures have not successfully controlled bleeding. Tourniquets must be released periodically (eg, every 45 minutes) to avoid prolonged ischemia and possible tissue loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H151199357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Control of hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p>Vascular access is obtained as rapidly as possible. Two large-bore (16 gauge or larger) IV lines placed in the antecubital region are ideal, but not always possible. Intraosseous devices can be placed rapidly and offer an effective alternative when there is difficulty placing an IV catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-venous-access-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral venous access in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraosseous-infusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraosseous infusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Placement of a central venous catheter (size 8 French) can be performed when adequate peripheral access cannot be obtained, and allows measurement of central venous pressure. Central line placement under ultrasound guidance offers high success rates with fewer complications than procedures performed without ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Some experts advocate use of distal saphenous vein cutdowns due to ease of access and consistency of anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Ultrasound is an integral part of the initial evaluation of the trauma patient, and reliably identifies free intraabdominal fluid in the hands of proficient ultrasonographers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. During the initial resuscitation, the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam, is performed to assess first for pericardial effusion and then for intraperitoneal bleeding and pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasound has largely replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in the initial assessment of the trauma patient, although DPL retains an important role in specific circumstances. If ultrasound is unavailable or its findings are equivocal or inconsistent with the clinical picture, a DPL or diagnostic peritoneal tap (DPT) can provide important information. An example of such a scenario would be an unstable patient with major pelvic trauma in whom the ultrasound cannot determine whether intraabdominal free fluid is blood or urine.

Preliminary stabilization of the pelvis by applying a circumferential pelvic binder or tying a sheet firmly around the pelvis can reduce bleeding. Such interventions are most important with &quot;open-book&quot; pelvic fractures (in which the symphysis pubis is disrupted (&ge;2.5 cm), the pelvis opened, and the retroperitoneal space enlarged) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73047\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73047 \">image 1</a>).

The blood bank should be notified directly (ie, by telephone or in person) of the need for packed red blood cells, and other blood products, should a trauma victim present with life-threatening hemorrhage.</p><p>The hematocrit can be useful as a baseline value, but must be interpreted in light of the clinical context, including the extent of hemorrhage, time since the injury, premorbid hematocrit, and the volume of exogenous fluid administration. As an example, the clinician should not be reassured by a normal hematocrit in the acute trauma victim with hypotension. The hematocrit is most helpful when measured serially to assess ongoing hemorrhage.</p><p>Hemorrhagic shock may create a metabolic acidosis with a base deficit (ie, decreased serum bicarbonate) or increased serum lactate. While such findings suggest shock, clinicians must interpret them in the context of the patient's clinical appearance. Typically, laboratory values lag behind clinical improvement after aggressive resuscitation.</p><p>Coagulation studies, a platelet count, and serum electrolytes are helpful to determine the need for blood products and electrolyte replacement, if hemorrhage is ongoing. Where available, thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) provide faster and more accurate assessment of coagulopathy in the trauma patient and can help guide ongoing treatment with clotting factors as well as reduce unnecessary transfusion.

A pregnancy test (eg, urine hCG) should be performed for women of child-bearing age. If pregnant, the patients Rh status should be checked. Appropriate coagulation studies should be performed for patients taking anticoagulant medications. Cardiac biomarkers or a serum concentration of an anticonvulsant should be obtained if an acute coronary syndrome or seizure, respectively, may have contributed to the trauma.

Patients may manifest tachypnea, chest pain, hypoxia, unilateral diminished or absent breath sounds, subcutaneous air, or unilateral hyperresonance to percussion, depending on underlying injuries and the extent of the pneumothorax.</p><p>Traumatic pneumothorax or hemothorax is typically managed by the placement of a large thoracostomy tube (36 French or larger) in the lateral chest. A small or occult pneumothorax may be amenable to management using a small catheter, aspiration, or close observation.

The ideal length is unclear, but a 4.5 cm (2 inch) needle is a reasonable first choice. Studies of chest wall thickness using CT scan suggest this length may be inadequate in some patients, but longer needles increase the risk of injuring the subclavian vessels or other structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. However, depending on the patient's body habitus, needles as long as 8 cm may be required for effective decompression. Should a 4.5 cm needle fail to decompress a tension pneumothorax and a tube thoracostomy be delayed, clinicians should use a longer needle.

If pericardiocentesis recovers blood and improves the patient's clinical status, emergency thoracotomy is indicated.

If the patient must be transferred for definitive care, early communication with a trauma center and preparation for transfer is performed concurrently with assessment and stabilization. The lack of adequate resources to manage a patient's injuries, including specialty and subspecialty care, is an indication for transfer to a trauma center. In cases involving a hypotensive patient with an identified injury (eg, high-grade splenic laceration), but no trauma surgeon is available, emergency consultation with a general surgeon may be necessary for possible laparotomy prior to a time-consuming transfer that would put the patient at risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3551796060\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Significant drops in blood pressure are generally not manifested until Class III hemorrhage develops, and up to 30 percent of a patient's blood volume can be lost before this occurs. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive hemorrhage can occur in the chest, abdomen, retroperitoneum, and from major external wounds. The thigh can hold up to approximately 1 L of blood. Scalp lacerations can bleed profusely and are often overlooked. Other potential causes of traumatic shock may include cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax. Non-hemorrhagic causes of traumatic shock may have typical presentations, but often do not. A detailed list of potential causes of traumatic shock is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63698 \">table 1</a>).

Young otherwise healthy patients can maintain a blood pressure within the normal range despite substantial blood loss; subtle alterations, such as agitation, confusion, irritability, or inattention, may be their only signs of early shock. Elder adults are more likely to take medications (eg, beta blockers) that affect the hemodynamic response to injury, and are more likely to have baseline hypertension. It is important to interpret vital signs in light of the patient's known or likely baseline.
