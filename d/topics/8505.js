Names often used interchangeably, but controversially, have included drug-induced vasculitis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, serum sickness, and allergic vasculitis. Over time, the term &quot;hypersensitivity vasculitis&quot; has become less commonly used since it is not included in either the 1994 or the 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature for systemic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Under this nomenclature system, hypersensitivity vasculitis may be more appropriately categorized as cutaneous arteritis (when isolated to the skin) or under other categories of systemic vasculitis, such as &quot;vasculitis associated with probable etiology&quot; when a triggering agent (eg, infection or drug) can be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions share clinical and pathologic features with hypersensitivity vasculitis; however, many cases do not have actual vascular inflammation. Serum sickness and serum sickness-like disorders are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypersensitivity vasculitis in children, including the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment, is reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98462834\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no pediatric-specific classification criteria for hypersensitivity vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. All available systems are based upon adult data. The most commonly used system is that of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Drugs'</a> below). Children were explicitly excluded when the ACR criteria were proposed in 1990 due to the lack of pediatric data. In the absence of clearly superior alternatives, the ACR criteria are nonetheless commonly used in children.</p><p>The ACR criteria for hypersensitivity vasculitis are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;16 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of a possible offending drug in temporal relation to the symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maculopapular rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy of a skin lesion showing neutrophils around an arteriole or venule</p><p/><p>The presence of three or more of these criteria has a sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of hypersensitivity vasculitis of 71 and 84 percent, respectively, among adults with known vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These criteria do not distinguish hypersensitivity vasculitis from immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]), with the latter characterized by the deposition of IgA in the skin lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity vasculitis was first reported after the administration of heterologous antisera and was initially called serum sickness. In the past, serum sickness was the most frequent form of vasculitis because of the use of therapeutic antisera.</p><p>Hypersensitivity vasculitis is thought to represent an immune response to agents reacting as haptens and resulting in immune complex deposition. In most cases, the inciting antigen is never identified, and the disease remains idiopathic. In others, it may be caused by a specific drug or occur in association with an infection, malignancy, or other systemic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs are the most common, identified cause of hypersensitivity vasculitis. Many medications can cause hypersensitivity vasculitis, but antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and anticonvulsants are most often implicated as the inciting agent in drug-mediated hypersensitivity vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81148 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Drug-induced vasculitis is a poorly defined disorder since proving causality is difficult. As a result, classification of all suspected cases of drug-induced vasculitis is based upon the following characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitating agent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involved organs (eg, isolated to the skin, gastrointestinal tract, etc)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic description</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Food</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foods and food additives are also thought to have the potential to trigger hypersensitivity vasculitis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As an example, in two reported cases, symptoms resolved after elimination of the suspected food antigen and recurred with reintroduction of the specific food (rechallenge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one child, the offending agent was cow's milk and, in the other, chocolate and other cocoa-containing products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several infectious agents have been associated with hypersensitivity vasculitis, including hepatitis B or C, streptococcal agents, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. Hypersensitivity vasculitis has also been reported in patients with endocarditis and infected shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15036260\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity vasculitis is initiated by deposition of soluble immune complexes that, together with immune reactants, are histologically identifiable in vessels early in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Immune complexes activate the classic and alternative complement pathways. The consequent mast cell degranulation, activation of neutrophils, release of cytokines and enzymes, and other processes in the cascade lead to tissue destruction and ultimately neutrophil phagocytosis and removal of the immune complexes within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Lesions most commonly occur in areas of decreased or slowed blood flow, particularly the lower extremities and other dependent areas, or under tight-fitting clothing. Edema may accompany some lesions. Other cutaneous manifestations of the vasculitis seen in some cases include macules, papules, ulcers, subcutaneous nodules, and urticaria.</p><p>In most patients, symptoms begin 7 to 10 days after antigen exposure, the time required to produce a sufficient quantity of primary antibody to form antigen-antibody complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Symptoms may be delayed for two weeks or more in the case of longer-acting drugs, such as benzathine penicillin, while the latent period may be as short as two to seven days with a secondary exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Manifestations usually appear abruptly. Skin lesions generally are at the same stage of development and typically resolve after a period of days to weeks. Postinflammatory pigmentation is common. Ulcerative or necrotic lesions may persist longer and leave residual scarring.</p><p>Additional findings may include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/5,6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,14,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malaise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Myalgias/arthralgias</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphadenopathy</p><p/><p>Despite the fact that skin lesions predominate, other organ systems may be involved to varying degrees. However, it is difficult to ascertain the frequency of noncutaneous organ involvement because of the lack of detailed description of internal organ involvement in most cases and a bias for reporting isolated cases with serious end-organ damage. In adult series, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and varying degrees of hepatocellular injury have all been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/6,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16,17</a>]. Lung, heart, and central nervous system involvement are less commonly reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Renal involvement is seen in some cases and is usually mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>]. Acute renal failure is rare but has been reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Although hypersensitivity vasculitis is usually acute and abates once the antigen has been cleared, prolonged disease may occur in conditions associated with chronic antigen exposure, such as persistent hepatitis B or C virus infection.

In general, postcapillary venules are the most prominently involved vessels, with less frequent capillary and arteriole involvement. Drug-induced small vessel vasculitis is associated with a greater degree of tissue eosinophilia than non-drug-induced vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-vasculitis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The histologic pattern is highly sensitive to the age of the lesion.

In contrast to patients with hypersensitivity vasculitis, patients with IgAV (HSP) usually have normal complement levels and evidence of IgA-containing immune complexes on skin or renal biopsy. An absence of recent use of medications that have the potential to cause vasculitis is also suggestive of the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) rather than hypersensitivity vasculitis. In practice, however, it may be difficult to distinguish between IgAV (HSP) and hypersensitivity vasculitis, especially in the absence of these differentiating factors.

Rarely, vasculitis lesions may occur in the lung, heart, and central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15036011\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hypersensitivity vasculitis is based upon clinical findings of palpable purpura <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> petechiae; the history of exposure to a potential inciting agent, such as a drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81148 \">table 1</a>) or infection; and a skin biopsy that demonstrates a leukocytoclastic vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52548%7ERHEUM%2F66296\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52548 graphicRef66296 \">image 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]) is most difficult to distinguish from hypersensitivity vasculitis. Normal complement levels and IgA deposition help to distinguish IgAV (HSP) from hypersensitivity vasculitis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major intervention in the treatment of children with hypersensitivity vasculitis is removal of the inciting agent. Symptomatic therapy used in severe or persistent skin lesions includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">colchicine</a>, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dapsone</a>. Immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids or cytotoxic agents should be reserved for the infrequent patient with fulminant or progressive disease or other organ involvement.
