However, lithium is also used as an adjunctive medication in patients who have inadequately responded to an antidepressant for treatment of unipolar depression (ie, depression with no lifetime history of mania or hypomania) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, lithium is used as monotherapy to treat acute episodes of unipolar depression and as maintenance treatment to prevent recurrence of unipolar depressive episodes. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> was first used by psychiatrists in the mid-1800s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The first controlled trial of lithium for unipolar depression was in 1968. </p><p>This topic reviews the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> as adjunctive treatment and as monotherapy for acute episodes and maintenance treatment of unipolar depression.

Lithium or an alternative adjunctive agent is often necessary because remission with antidepressant monotherapy occurs in only 28 to 47 percent of patients, even with an optimal trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. It is commonly thought that augmentation is more effective for patients who initially have a partial response to antidepressant monotherapy, compared with patients who do not respond at all, but this is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3473158985\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Results from many studies support using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> for depressed patients who do not fully respond to an antidepressant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> (commonly 800 or 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with placebo as an adjunct to antidepressants in 237 depressed patients (unipolar depression = 224 and bipolar depression = 13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred in more patients who received adjunctive lithium than placebo (odds ratio 3, 95% CI 2-5). Lithium provided one more response than placebo for every five patients treated with each regimen (number needed to treat of five). Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects was comparable for both groups. In addition, subgroup analyses found that lithium was efficacious for augmenting first-generation antidepressants (eg, tricyclics) and for augmenting second-generation antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A network meta-analysis of 48 randomized trials (n &gt;6000 depressed patients) evaluated the efficacy of 11 augmentation agents by using results from direct comparisons between the drugs, as well as indirectly comparing drugs through their relative effect with a common comparator (typically placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A study examined a pharmacy data base that included nearly 250,000 patients with unipolar depression, and found that more patients received a second antidepressant, an antipsychotic, or an anticonvulsant as augmentation compared with lithium (10.9 versus 7.3 versus 3.7 versus 0.5 percent of all patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Pharmacogenetic studies suggest that several single nucleotide polymorphisms are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11208566\"><span class=\"h1\">LITHIUM MONOTHERAPY FOR ACUTE DEPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> monotherapy may effectively treat acute unipolar depression, but there is far less evidence than there is for antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. We do not use lithium as first-, second-, or third-line treatment for acute unipolar depression. When lithium is used to treat acute depression, we suggest it be prescribed to achieve a serum level of 0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> based upon our clinical experience. </p><p>Evidence supporting the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> for acute unipolar depression includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A six-week controlled trial assigned 27 patients with major depression to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> or placebo. Fewer patients who received lithium withdrew from the study as treatment failures, and among patients who remained in the study, depression rating scale scores were lower at weeks four and five in patients who received lithium compared with patients who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of four controlled studies, in which 148 patients were treated for three weeks with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> at a serum level of 0.4 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.4 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or with an antidepressant, found a moderate clinical effect favoring lithium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial compared lithium with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> in patients with depression and found that efficacy was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the lack of a placebo arm makes it more difficult to interpret the treatment effects observed in these studies. In addition, no randomized trials have compared lithium with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> for treating acute unipolar depression.</p><p/><p>There are no established predictors for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>&rsquo;s acute antidepressant effect. Lithium may be more effective for bipolar depression compared with unipolar depression, thus, a family history of bipolar depression may possibly predict a better outcome for lithium&rsquo;s efficacy in acute unipolar depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>However, the recurrent or cyclical nature of the mood disorder may be associated with a positive response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, rather than polarity. In a prospective observational study of 30 patients with acute unipolar major depression who were treated for four weeks, response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred in more patients with a recurrent episode than patients with a first lifetime episode (15 of 22 versus 0 of 8 patients [68 versus 0 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11208572\"><span class=\"h1\">LITHIUM MONOTHERAPY AS MAINTENANCE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> prevents recurrence of unipolar depression. </p><p>Two meta-analyses have compared the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> monotherapy with placebo as maintenance treatment.

A subsequent meta-analysis of a nine controlled trials (229 patients with unipolar depression) found that recurrence of depression occurred in significantly fewer patients who received lithium compared with patients who received placebo (36 versus 75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Two meta-analyses have compared the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> monotherapy with an antidepressant as maintenance treatment. One meta-analysis of seven controlled trials (298 patients with unipolar depression) found that recurrence of depression occurred in a similar number of patients who received lithium compared with patients who received a tricyclic antidepressant (48 versus 56 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis of eight trials (475 patients, the large majority had unipolar depression) also compared the efficacy of lithium with antidepressants in preventing recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. One analysis that defined recurrence as admission to the hospital (three studies with 152 patients) found recurrence of depression occurred in significantly fewer patients who received lithium compared with patients who received an antidepressant (7 versus 22 percent). Analyses that used different definitions of recurrence found that the rate of recurrence was comparable for patients who received lithium and patients who received an antidepressant. In addition, there were no significant differences between lithium and antidepressants in the overall drop-out rate (as a proxy measure of overall acceptability of treatment), drop-out due to side effects, and number of patients who reported at least one side-effect. The lack of a placebo arm makes it more difficult to interpret the treatment effects observed in these studies. </p><p>Another meta-analysis examined the benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> prophylaxis in mirror-image studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In these case-controlled studies, the rate of depressive recurrences during a specified time period prior to using maintenance lithium (eg, two years) was compared with the rate of recurrence for the same length of time after lithium maintenance treatment was introduced into the patient&rsquo;s treatment regimen. The analysis found that the number of recurrences before lithium decreased by 69 percent after lithium. Results from mirror-image studies need to be interpreted cautiously, because they assume everything, except the intervention, has remained the same during the two time periods that are compared. This assumption is problematic. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> is not used often to prevent recurrence of unipolar depression in the United States, despite the evidence supporting it. As an example, the American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines for Major Depressive Disorder do not mention lithium as an option for maintenance treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-lithium/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, based upon our clinical experience, we consider using lithium monotherapy as maintenance treatment for patients who fail maintenance treatment with an antidepressant. In addition, patients who respond to lithium augmentation for treatment of an acute depressive syndrome are also candidates for lithium monotherapy maintenance treatment. Lithium may also be useful in maintenance treatment as augmentation of an antidepressant, but there is little evidence to support this practice. </p><p>Based upon the serum levels used in controlled trials and our clinical experience, we suggest clinicians prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> to achieve a serum level of 0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.
