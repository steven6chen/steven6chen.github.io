Early diagnosis of factitious diarrhea can prevent patient self-harm as well as iatrogenic complications arising from unnecessary tests and treatments. This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of factitious diarrhea. Other causes of chronic diarrhea and the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of factitious disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious disorder imposed on self (Munchausen syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605048658\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 90 percent of patients with factitious diarrhea are women and have a history of work in the healthcare field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These patients often seek care from many clinicians and have multiple hospital admissions in an effort to establish the cause of the diarrhea. They also have a higher incidence of anorexia nervosa, suggesting a common underlying psychiatric basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Surreptitious laxative abuse is the most frequent cause of factitious diarrhea and often presents as chronic watery diarrhea of unknown etiology. In one study in which 47 patients at a tertiary referral center for evaluation of diarrhea of unclear etiology were screened for laxative use, seven patients (15 percent) tested positive for laxatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605048605\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with factitious diarrhea often present with a history of frequent, large-volume, watery diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Patients report between 10 and 20 bowel movements a day, with 24-hour stool volumes ranging from 300 to 3000 mL. More than 50 percent of patients complain of nocturnal bowel movements. Patients may also report associated blood in the stool. </p><p>In patients with factious diarrhea due to laxatives, diarrhea is often associated with cramping abdominal pain due to an increase in the fluid content of the stool and enhanced gastrointestinal motility. Lethargy, generalized weakness, and dizziness or lightheadedness may result from orthostatic hypotension due to dehydration. Weight loss is common, and in severe cases, patients may have malnutrition and cachexia due to diarrhea, concurrent nausea or vomiting, or diminished nutrient absorption. As an example, rhein (an anthraquinone) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a> (a diphenolic laxative) impair glucose absorption and may also cause mild steatorrhea and gastrointestinal protein loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension#H5756013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms, causes, and evaluation of orthostatic hypotension&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H6451393\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'Stimulant laxatives'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605048505\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypokalemia is frequently present due to losses in the diarrheal fluid. Hypovolemia-induced secondary hyperaldosteronism may also contribute by increasing colonic potassium secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic diarrhea caused by laxative abuse often results in metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The alkalosis may be due in part to hypokalemia impairing the intestinal reabsorption of chloride, thereby diminishing bicarbonate secretion into the intestinal lumen via chloride-bicarbonate exchange. Loss of a high-chloride, low-bicarbonate solution can raise the plasma bicarbonate concentration, and both volume depletion and hypokalemia prevent excretion of the excess bicarbonate in the urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Moderate to severe hypermagnesemia can occur if a magnesium-containing laxative is used, particularly in patients in whom urinary magnesium excretion is impaired because of volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

It is characterized by dilation of the large bowel, with decreased or absent haustrations noted on plain abdominal films or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema. The changes are usually most marked in the right colon but can affect the entire colon. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605048468\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of factitious diarrhea is based on a self-induced true increase in stool volume or the creation of an apparent increase in stool volume by the addition of substances (eg, urine, water) to the stool. Although laboratory testing and endoscopic findings may be supportive of the diagnosis of factitious diarrhea, they are limited in their sensitivity and specificity. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, and test results need to be interpreted in the context of the patient's history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706539452\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factitious diarrhea is often suspected in patients in whom organic causes of chronic diarrhea have been ruled out. An approach to the evaluation of a patient with chronic diarrhea is discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of a patient with factitious diarrhea includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History in a patient with factitious diarrhea may provide several clues to support the diagnosis. These include high rates of healthcare utilization; evasiveness in providing history; refusal to grant access to prior medical records; inconsistencies in the history, examination, and laboratory tests; and a lengthy and extensive prior clinical evaluation that is negative. Room searches for laxatives, a common practice in the past, are no longer advisable for legal reasons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies, including stool osmolality, electrolytes, osmotic gap, and a laxative screen. Laboratory testing should also include a complete blood count and differential, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, serum electrolytes, total protein and albumin to assess the volume and nutritional status and to detect electrolyte derangements. (See <a href=\"#H605048505\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H612571381\" class=\"local\">'Stool osmolality'</a> below and <a href=\"#H612571387\" class=\"local\">'Stool electrolytes and osmotic gap'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonoscopy if not previously performed as part of the evaluation for chronic diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"#H706539587\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612571381\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool osmolality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 24-hour stool specimen should be evaluated for stool osmolality. Normal fecal fluid has an osmolality close to that of plasma (290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Stool osmolality &lt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> suggests that factitious diarrhea may be from the addition of water or hypotonic urine to the stool as the colon cannot dilute stool to an osmolality that is less than that of plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p>Stool osmolality &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> (particularly with a high sodium concentration &gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> may be due to the addition or the contamination of stool by concentrated urine. If the stool is not examined quickly, stool osmolality can also increase due to breakdown of carbohydrates by bacteria into smaller, osmotically active molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Urine contamination of stool can be confirmed by demonstrating high concentrations of urea in fecal fluid. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612571387\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool electrolytes and osmotic gap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stool sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate should be measured in patients suspected of having factitious diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Stool magnesium &gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and phosphate &gt;33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> suggest magnesium- and phosphate-induced diarrhea, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H6451384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'Osmotic agents'</a>.)</p><p>The osmotic gap is calculated by subtracting twice the measured concentrations of sodium and potassium from 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/kg,</span> which is the expected osmolality of freshly passed diarrheal stool (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-stool-osmolal-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). An osmotic gap exceeding 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/kg</span> can be due to laxatives containing magnesium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, lactose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>, or polyethylene glycol as the active ingredients. An osmotic gap less than 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/kg</span> may be due to the use of a secretory laxative (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a>) or osmotic diarrhea caused by a sodium-containing laxative. A negative osmotic gap is suggestive of a phosphate- or sulfate-containing laxative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H30890967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'Other laxatives'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612571646\"><span class=\"h2\">Laxative screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest laxative screening on a stool specimen for diphenolic laxatives (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a>) and polyethylene glycol-containing laxatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As patients consume one or more laxatives at a time, or may rotate laxatives, specimens should be screened for both osmotic and stimulant laxatives. Analysis of stool should repeated if negative if there is a high index of suspicion, as laxatives may be ingested intermittently. </p><p>Laxative screens have several limitations. Laxative screens cannot reliably detect anthraquinones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a>, cascara), and assays do not exist for several other laxatives (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=castor-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">castor oil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>). Stool screens for diphenolic laxatives have limited sensitivity and specificity and therefore the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results must be considered while interpreting the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although laxatives can also be detected in blood, plasma concentrations are lower than stool or urine concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H612571387\" class=\"local\">'Stool electrolytes and osmotic gap'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706539587\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of anthraquinone-containing laxative use may have melanosis coli. However, the presence of melanosis coli is not specific and has been reported in patients with chronic colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Melanosis coli is not associated with the use of osmotic or diphenolic laxatives. On endoscopy, melanosis coli appears as a dark brown discoloration of the colon with lymph follicles shining through as pale patches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50472\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50472 \">picture 1</a>). While melanosis coli usually affects the proximal colon, the entire colon may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. If melanosis coli is not evident on endoscopy, it can be demonstrated histologically by finding lipofuscin pigment in the macrophages of the lamina propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Melanosis coli can develop within four months of the onset of anthraquinone-containing laxatives and can disappear in the same amount of time if it is discontinued.
