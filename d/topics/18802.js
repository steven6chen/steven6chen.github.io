The risk of developing these infections depends upon the geographic location, season of the year, type of tick, and, for Lyme disease, how long the tick was attached to the skin.</p><p>While many people are concerned after being bitten by a tick, the risk of acquiring a tick-borne infection is quite low, even if the tick has been attached, fed, and is actually carrying an infectious agent. Ticks transmit infection only after they have attached and then taken a blood meal from their new host. A tick that has not attached (and therefore has not yet become engorged from its blood meal) has not passed any infection. Since the deer tick that transmits Lyme disease typically feeds for &gt;36 hours before transmission of the spirochete, the risk of acquiring Lyme disease from an observed tick bite, for example, is only 1.2 to 1.4 percent, even in an area where the disease is common.</p><p>The organism that causes Lyme disease, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, lies dormant in the inner aspect of the tick's midgut. The organism becomes active only after exposure to the warm blood meal entering the tick's gut. Once active, the organism enters the tick's salivary glands. As the tick feeds, it must get rid of excess water through the salivary glands. Thus, the tick will literally salivate organisms into the wound, thereby passing the infection to the host.</p><p>If a person is bitten by a deer tick (the type of tick that carries Lyme disease), a healthcare provider will likely advise one of two approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observe and treat if signs or symptoms of infection develop</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat with a preventive antibiotic immediately</p><p/><p>There is no benefit of blood testing for Lyme disease at the time of the tick bite; even people who become infected will not have a positive blood test until approximately two to six weeks after the infection develops (post-tick bite).</p><p>The history of the tick bite will largely determine which of these options is chosen. Before seeking medical attention, the affected person or household member should carefully remove the tick and make note of its appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51825 \">picture 1</a>). Only the <em>Ixodes</em> species of tick, also known as the deer tick, causes Lyme disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO REMOVE A TICK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proper way to remove a tick is to use a set of fine tweezers and grip the tick as close to the skin as is possible. Do not use a smoldering match or cigarette, nail polish, petroleum jelly (eg, Vaseline), liquid soap, or kerosene because they may irritate the tick and cause it to behave like a syringe, injecting bodily fluids into the wound.</p><p>The proper technique for tick removal includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use fine tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin surface as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pull backwards gently but firmly, using an even, steady pressure. Do not jerk or twist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not squeeze, crush, or puncture the body of the tick, since its bodily fluids may contain infection-causing organisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After removing the tick, wash the skin and hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If any mouth parts of the tick remain in the skin, these should be left alone; they will be expelled on their own. Attempts to remove these parts may result in significant skin trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">AFTER THE TICK IS REMOVED</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tick characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is helpful if the person can provide information about the size and color of the tick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68309 \">figure 1</a>), whether it was actually attached to the skin, if it was engorged (that is, full of blood), and how long it was attached.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ticks that are brown and approximately the size of a poppy seed or pencil point are deer ticks; however, the size can change with feeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51825 \">picture 1</a>). These ticks can transmit <em>B. burgdorferi</em> (the bacterium that causes Lyme disease) and a number of other tick-borne infections, including babesiosis and anaplasmosis. <em>B.</em> <em>burgdorferi</em>-infected deer ticks live primarily in the northeast and mid-Atlantic region (Maine to Virginia) and in the midwest region (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio) of the United States, and less commonly in the western US (northern California).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ticks that are brown with a white collar and about the size of a pencil eraser are more likely to be dog ticks (<em>Dermacentor</em> species) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51825 \">picture 1</a>). These ticks do not carry Lyme disease, but can rarely carry another tick-borne infection called Rocky Mountain spotted fever that can be serious or even fatal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brown to black tick with a white splotch on its back is likely a female <em>Amblyomma americanum</em> (Lone Star tick; named after the white splotch) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50244\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50244 \">picture 2</a>). This species of tick has been reported to spread an illness called southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). STARI causes a rash that is similar to the erythema migrans rash, but without the other features of Lyme disease. Although this rash is thought to be caused by an infection, a cause for the infection has not yet been identified. This type of tick can also carry and transmit another infection called human monocytic ehrlichiosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tick that was not attached, was easy to remove or just walking on the skin, and was still flat and tiny and not full of blood when it was removed could not have transmitted Lyme disease or any other infection since it had not yet taken a blood meal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only ticks that are attached and have finished feeding or are near the end of their meal can transmit Lyme disease. After arriving on the skin, the tick that spreads Lyme disease usually takes 24 hours before feeding begins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even if a tick is attached, it must have taken a blood meal to transmit Lyme disease. At least 36 to 48 hours of feeding is typically required for a tick to have fed and then transmit the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. After this amount of time, the tick will be engorged (full of blood). An engorged tick has a globular shape and is larger than an unengorged one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not clear how long a tick needs to be attached to transmit organisms other than <em>B.</em> <em>burgdorferi</em>. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician will review the description of the tick, along with any physical symptoms, to decide upon a course of action. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends preventive treatment with antibiotics only in people who meet <strong>ALL</strong> of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attached tick identified as an adult or nymphal <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> (deer) tick</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick is estimated to have been attached for &ge;36 hours (based upon how engorged the tick appears or the amount of time since outdoor exposure)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antibiotic can be given within 72 hours of tick removal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The local rate of tick infection with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is &ge;20 percent (known to occur in parts of New England, parts of the mid-Atlantic states, and parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The person can take doxycycline (eg, the person is not pregnant or breastfeeding or a child &lt;8 years of age)</p><p/><p>If the person meets ALL of the above criteria, the recommended dose of doxycycline is a single dose of 200 mg for adults and 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> up to a maximum dose of 200 mg, in children &ge; 8 years.</p><p>If the person cannot take doxycycline, the IDSA does not recommend preventive treatment with an alternate antibiotic for several reasons: there are no data to support a short course of another antibiotic, a longer course of antibiotics may have side effects, antibiotic treatment is highly effective if Lyme disease were to develop, and the risk of developing a serious complication of Lyme disease after a recognized bite is extremely low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING FOR LYME DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people have incorrect information about Lyme disease. For example, some people are concerned that Lyme disease is untreatable if antibiotics are not given early (this is untrue; even later features of Lyme disease can be effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics). Many local Lyme disease networks and national organizations disseminate unproven information and should not be the sole source of education about Lyme disease. Reputable sources are listed below (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs of Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether or not a clinician is consulted after a tick bite, the person who was bitten (or the parents, if a child was bitten) should observe the area of the bite for expanding redness, which would suggest erythema migrans (EM), the characteristic rash of Lyme disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58798 \">picture 3</a>). Approximately 80 percent of people with Lyme disease develop EM; 10 to 20 percent of people have multiple lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Lyme disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The EM rash is usually a salmon color although, rarely, it can be an intense red, sometimes resembling a skin infection. The color may be almost uniform. The lesion typically expands over a few days or weeks and can reach over 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. As the rash expands, it can become clear (skin-colored) in the center. The center of the rash can then appear a lighter color than its edges or the rash can develop into a series of concentric rings giving it a &quot;bull's eye&quot; appearance. The rash usually causes no symptoms, although burning or itching has been reported.</p><p>In people with early localized Lyme disease, EM occurs within one month of the tick bite, typically within a week of the tick bite, although only one-third of people recall the tick bite that gave them Lyme disease. Components of tick saliva can also cause a rash; however, this rash should not be confused with EM. The rash caused by tick saliva typically occurs while the tick is still feeding or just after the tick detaches, and usually does not expand to a size larger than a dime.</p><p>If EM or other signs or symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease develop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72018 \">table 1</a>), the person should see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
