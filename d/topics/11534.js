Only 36 of 738 respondents (5.2 percent) reported a new diagnosis of asthma, corresponding to an incidence of 0.23 percent per year.</p><p/><p>An unanswered question is whether inhaled glucocorticoids or other newer modalities of therapy can reduce airways remodeling and alter the natural history of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. When assessed in children, inhaled glucocorticoids did not alter the natural history of asthma; benefits of inhaled glucocorticoids on asthma symptoms and lung function waned after discontinuation.

In one report, for example, 1095 asthmatics were compared with 16,411 normal subjects using data collected over 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The participants with asthma had a greater rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> (38 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year)</span> compared with nonasthmatic participants (22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year)</span>.

In a study of young adults between the ages of 21 and 28 years, those with the most severe symptoms had the most rapid rate of decline in the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/forced</span> vital capacity (FVC) ratio compared to controls and patients with less severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recently diagnosed asthma</strong> - The rate of decline in lung function may be greatest in those with new onset asthma. One group studied 10,952 persons who were part of an ongoing longitudinal study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, to analyze the rate of decline in lung function of adults with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Over a five-year period, 159 subjects were identified who were self-reported asthmatics at initial study and follow-up and 185 subjects who reported no asthma on initial encounter but developed asthma during the study. Those with new onset asthma had the largest loss of lung function; the excess decline, on average, was 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year</span> in men and 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year</span> in women when compared with declines in those without asthma. However, after controlling for the initial level of FEV<sub>1</sub>, the rates of decline were not different between the groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a subsequent report of 15 years of follow-up data from the same group, the more rapid decline in lung function of asthmatics was confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> among subjects with asthma was 38 mL per year, compared with 22 mL per year in those without asthma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another study of adults greater than 60 years of age also noted a rapid decline in lung function around the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Rates of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> were almost twice as high in subjects with newly diagnosed asthma as in other subjects. This phenomenon may reflect the fact that the decline in lung function was what led the patients to seek medical attention. Alternatively, it may reflect submaximal therapy, although it is uncertain that optimal treatment can modify the rapid rates of decline in asthmatics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of asthma in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cigarette smoking</strong> - Cigarette smoking may contribute to a more rapid rate of decline in lung function in patients with asthma. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, participants with asthma who smoked had the greatest rate of lung function decline compared with nonasthmatics and nonsmoking asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>In contrast to the above studies, the Melbourne Asthma Study, which followed patients with persistent childhood asthma up to age 50 (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Effect on future lung function'</a> above), did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline between the asthmatic groups and the non-asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-asthma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, this observation may be due to the relatively small number of subjects and the substantial deficits in lung function at a young age that did not leave much room for further decline in lung function. Similarly, data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) suggest that reduced lung growth due to early onset persistent childhood asthma has a greater impact on adult lung function than decline in lung function.

No single lower respiratory tract symptom before the age of one year is predictive of a diagnosis of asthma at a later age. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Wheezing during the first six years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most children, wheezing before the age of six years is probably a benign condition reflecting smaller airways that will improve or resolve in a few years. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Wheezing during the first six years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subgroup of children with wheezing before age six will have persistence of symptoms and will eventually develop clinical asthma. This subgroup is characterized by the atopic state, relatively severe and persistent symptoms at a young age, and a maternal history of asthma. Maternal smoking may also contribute. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Wheezing during the first six years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with more severe symptoms tend to have lower lung function than those with less severe symptoms; deficits in lung function that are established by six to seven years often persist into adult life. (See <a href=\"#H377363664\" class=\"local\">'Severe asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing and asthma in adolescence is associated with a high rate of persistence into adulthood (approximately 75 percent). Similarly, adults with wheezing are more likely than children to experience persistent asthma. However, adolescents and adults are unlikely to experience progressive worsening of asthma in the absence of other comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Wheezing in later childhood'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;New onset&quot; asthma in adulthood sometimes has its origin in undiagnosed childhood asthma. For those without evidence of prior asthma, adult onset asthma is more likely to occur in women than men. The frequency of new onset asthma in women increases during the perimenopausal years. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adult onset asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with severe asthma, older adults (&ge;65 years) have significantly more impaired lung function than younger adults, although their health care utilization for asthma is lower. (See <a href=\"#H3376796758\" class=\"local\">'Severe asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with healthy adults, the rate of loss of lung function is greater among adults with asthma, those with more severe asthma symptoms, and those with newly diagnosed asthma.
