It is a diagnostic criterion for chronic bronchitis and one of the primary causes of airflow obstruction. In addition, chronic mucus hypersecretion is associated with increased mortality, an accelerated decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and an increased risk of hospitalization in COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The role of mucoactive therapy in the management of COPD will be reviewed here. The role of mucoactive agents in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease and non-CF bronchiectasis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H804987757\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mucoactive drug is defined as an agent with the capability of modifying mucus production, secretion, its nature and composition, or its interactions with the mucociliary epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Examples of mucoactive drugs include expectorants (induce cough or increase the volume of secretions), mucolytics (reduce the viscosity of mucus), mucokinetic drugs (increase the mobility and transportability of mucus), and mucoregulators (control the process of hypersecretion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPERTIES OF MUCUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surface liquid covering the epithelial lining of the airways comprises at least two layers: the mucus layer (gel) and the periciliary layer surrounding the cilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In contrast to traditional models where the periciliary layer is assumed to be liquid (sol), a more current model consider it as consisting of a gel mesh of cell-tethered mucins and polysaccharides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Mucus consists of a mixture of transudative fluid and secretions from surface epithelium and submucosal glands. It is predominantly composed of water (95 percent) and glycoproteins (2 to 3 percent), with smaller components of proteoglycans (0.1 to 0.5 percent), lipids (0.3 to 0.5 percent), proteins, and DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The glycoprotein component consists of secreted mucins, particularly the large polymeric structures MUC5AC and MUC5B, which account for the rheologic properties (ie, properties governing flow) of mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Mucus is a movable barrier that maintains hydration and contains defense factors against various pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The normal volume of mucus secretion is approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], with a mucociliary clearance of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrometers/second</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Tracheobronchial mucus behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid with viscoelastic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The liquid-like, viscous properties allow the mucus to be extruded by glands, whereas the solid-like, elastic properties permit the transfer, storage, and conversion into motion of the energy imparted by the moving cilia. Glycoproteins are essential for this elasticity of mucus. A surfactant layer between the mucus gel and periciliary sol acts as a lubricant that also facilitates the transfer of energy from beating cilia to mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Mucus secretion can increase three-fold in COPD and 10-fold in cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Mucus composition can also change in disease states. For instance, concentrations of MUC5B and MUC5AC increase 3-fold and 10-fold respectively in ever smokers with severe COPD relative to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Further, DNA can contribute up to 10 percent of the dry weight of mucus secretions in cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The hydration of mucus also declines with disease states, from a 95 percent normal water composition, to 90 percent in smokers, and &lt;83 percent in cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A contributing factor to the dehydration of airway mucous may be internalization of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As the mucin concentration increases in disease states, mucociliary clearance declines, until a threshold following which adherent secretions may only be managed by cough clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Uncleared mucus otherwise contributes to airway obstruction and to the risk for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The importance of mucus secretion in the pathophysiology of disease is highlighted by the finding that total mucin concentration predicts traditionally defined chronic bronchitis, and may serve a biologic marker for this otherwise clinically defined disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In determining the ability of an agent to promote clearance of secretions, both mucociliary clearance and cough clearance need to be addressed. Different rheologic properties have been reported to have different and potentially antagonistic effects on these two mechanisms of mucus transport. As an example, mucus clearance requires effective transfer of the kinetic energy from beating cilia to the mucus. In that regard, factors that improve mucociliary transport include: a higher mucus elasticity (to store the transmitted energy), lower mucus viscosity (to reduce loss of energy), higher adhesivity (that hinders wave formation in the gel layer), increased spinnability (a measure of the thread forming ability of mucus), increased ciliary beat frequency, a thinner mucus layer, and a periciliary (sol) layer that is just less than the height of the cilia (to improve coupling with ciliary tips) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/5,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,17</a>].</p><p>In contrast, factors that improve cough clearance include: a higher mucus viscosity, lower mucus elasticity (to reduce recoil of cough-sheared mucus), lower adhesivity (to promote wave formation in the gel), lower spinnability (ability to be spun into a thread), a thicker mucus layer, and a periciliary layer that is higher than the height of the cilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>]. However, these general concepts may not always apply across disease states. For instance, in one study of mucus transport in patients with cystic fibrosis, the elastic modulus (capacity to be deformed elastically) was found to be negatively correlated with mucociliary transport, whereas contact angle (a reflection of surface tension associated with the adhesive properties of mucus: a higher contact angle reflects poor wettability and poor adhesiveness) was negatively correlated with cough clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Disease states may affect the rheological properties of mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For instance, the levels of the gel-forming mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are elevated in the airways and sputum of individuals with chronic respiratory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and may contribute to the viscoelastic properties of mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Increased purulence of sputum results in increased viscosity, surface tension, elastic modulus, contact angle, and in decreased cough transport, but these effects may be secondary to decreased water content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients with asthma appear to have the highest sputum viscosity, while patients with cystic fibrosis have lower viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis have sputum with intermediate viscosities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Subsequent attention has focused upon the role of the periciliary layer. Studies have shown that transport of the periciliary layer is mucus dependent. This suggests that new therapies for the treatment of excess respiratory mucus should focus on the restoration of airway surface liquid volume rather than alteration of its tonicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518133719\"><span class=\"h1\">MUCOACTIVE EFFECTS OF ROUTINE TREATMENTS FOR COPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the most important intervention to reduce sputum production is cigarette smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Some routine therapies for COPD, in addition to their bronchodilator or anti-inflammatory effects, also have mucoactive effects. </p><p>Bronchodilators act as mucokinetic agents by improving airflow and facilitating mucus clearance.

As an example, aerosolized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> (a potent sympathomimetic amine with almost exclusive beta-adrenergic activity) increases mucus clearance, presumably from increased ciliary beat rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This effect is not due to bronchial vasodilation, the presence of aqueous aerosol droplets, reflex parasympathetic activation, or bronchodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticholinergics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anticholinergic agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> is an effective antisialagogue (reduces saliva secretion) that results in significant reductions in tracheal mucus velocity and mucociliary transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

However, some of these effects depend on a relatively high dose that causes gastric irritation (and thus a vagally-mediated increase in airway secretions), rather than on the bronchodilator effect. Overall, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminophylline</a> increases tracheobronchial mucociliary clearance in patients with COPD, but this effect is not associated with identifiable improvement in pulmonary function or cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Properties of mucus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General recommendations for treating excess mucus in COPD focus on the treatment of underlying airways obstruction, airway inflammation, and mucus production by the use of cigarette smoking cessation and guideline-based use of bronchodilator therapy and inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as the occasional use of methylxanthines or phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H518133719\" class=\"local\">'Mucoactive effects of routine treatments for COPD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic therapy helps in acute exacerbations of COPD associated with increased sputum volume or purulence by reducing the bacterial load that contributes to inflammation and sputum production. In addition, long-term antibiotic therapy may reduce the rate of exacerbations among selected patients who have more than two exacerbations a year. (See <a href=\"#H518133576\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics and antiviral agents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely use oral thiol preparations in patients with COPD to treat sputum production or to prevent exacerbations. However, for patients with bothersome sputum production that is refractory to smoking cessation, routine therapies for COPD, and a course of antibiotics (when indicated), therapy with an oral thiol preparation (eg, N-acetyl cysteine [NAC], 600 mg twice daily) can be initiated on a trial basis and continued if there is symptomatic improvement. Side effects of thiol preparations include nausea, vomiting, and allergic reactions. We avoid nebulized NAC due to the potential for acute bronchospasm. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Thiols and thiol derivatives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While over-hydration provides no benefit in sputum clearance for patients with COPD, avoiding dehydration is appropriate. Modalities, such as hypertonic saline inhalation, oral expectorants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guaifenesin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guaifenesin</a>), oral iodide preparations (eg, saturated solution of potassium iodide [SSKI]), inhaled cromoglycate, and inhalation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dornase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">DNase</a>, may alter the characteristics of mucus but lack substantial evidence of clinical efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H518134549\" class=\"local\">'Mucoactive agents of limited or no benefit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Future therapies may include agents that decrease sputum adhesiveness or viscosity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease sputum production, such as surfactants, actin-severing agents, and prostaglandin inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H518133760\" class=\"local\">'Experimental mucoactive agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oscillating (eg, flutter valve, acapella device) and other mechanical devices have been used in bronchiectasis to aid in airway clearance. It is not known whether such therapy would be beneficial in patients with COPD. We occasionally use oscillating devices for patients with COPD who have tenacious or copious sputum. Patients breathe in and out through the device for several larger than tidal volume breaths then expectorate any sputum that has been raised. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical devices to improve mucus clearance'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-mucoactive-agents-and-secretion-clearance-techniques-in-copd/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vestbo J.
