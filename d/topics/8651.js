Ninety percent of cases occur in the pediatric age group. In contrast to many other forms of systemic vasculitis, IgAV (HSP) is self-limited in the great majority of cases. The disease is characterized by a tetrad of clinical manifestations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura in patients with neither thrombocytopenia nor coagulopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Arthritis/arthralgia</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) are presented here.

In a population-based study from the United Kingdom, the annual incidence was approximately 20 per 100,000 in children &lt;17 years of age, with a peak incidence of 70 per 100,000 in children between the ages of four and six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In reports from Taiwan and the Czech Republic, there was a lower incidence of 10 per 100,000 in children &lt;17 years of age, with a peak incidence at five to seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A subsequent population-based study from France showed an incidence relatively similar to previously reported numbers, suggesting general stability of the incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. IgAV (HSP) is less common in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], with an estimated annual incidence of 5 per 100,000 adults in Slovenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In two retrospective studies from Spain and Korea, 25 to 30 percent of patients with IgAV (HSP) were adults. In both cohorts, adults had significantly worse renal outcomes compared with children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>There is a male predominance with reported male-to-female ratios of 1.2:1 to 1.8:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8,11,12</a>]. IgAV (HSP) is seen less frequently in black compared with white or Asian children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>IgAV (HSP) occurs primarily in the fall, winter, and spring but rarely in the summer months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>], possibly explained by the association of IgAV (HSP) with infections. Approximately one-half of the cases of IgAV (HSP) are preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], especially those caused by <em>Streptococcus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other infectious agents, vaccinations, and insect bites also have been implicated as possible triggers for IgAV (HSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a systematic literature review, it was noted that a majority of the studies had failed to show causal association between vaccinations and vasculitides including IgAV (HSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The rate of IgAV (HSP) is significantly higher (approximately 5 percent) in patients with familial Mediterranean fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H324266508\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of classification criteria for IgAV (HSP) have been proposed, primarily for use in research protocols and outcome studies. They have not been validated for the diagnosis of individual cases.</p><p>In 1990, a committee of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) established criteria to classify seven types of vasculitides including IgAV (HSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The ACR criteria for the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at onset &le;20 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy showing granulocytes in the walls of small arterioles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> venules</p><p/><p>These criteria were based upon a comparison between 85 patients with IgAV (HSP) and 722 adult patients with other forms of vasculitis. Two or more of the criteria had a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 90 percent in separating adult patients with IgAV (HSP) from those with other causes of vasculitis.</p><p>In 2005, pediatric consensus criteria were developed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and were subsequently validated in conjunction with the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These criteria are more appropriate for pediatric settings in which a clinician is most likely seeking features to distinguish IgAV (HSP) from gastroenteritis or appendicitis rather than from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's). The mandatory criterion is purpura (usually palpable and in clusters) or petechiae, with lower limb predominance and without thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. Patients also must have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain (usually diffuse, with acute onset)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis or arthralgia (acute onset)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal involvement (proteinuria, hematuria)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytoclastic vasculitis or proliferative glomerulonephritis, with predominant IgA deposition</p><p/><p>However, IgAV (HSP) is not the only disease that may have these manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgAV (HSP) is an immune-mediated vasculitis associated with IgA deposition. Although a variety of infectious and chemical triggers are recognized, the underlying cause of IgAV (HSP) remains unknown. Immunologic, genetic, and environmental factors all seem to play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region as well as polymorphisms in other immune-related genes are associated with IgAV (HSP), sometimes with conflicting results, which could be due to differences in ethnic and environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>The characteristic finding of IgAV (HSP) is leukocytoclastic vasculitis accompanied by IgA immune complexes within affected organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52548%7ERHEUM%2F66296\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52548 graphicRef66296 \">image 1A-B</a>). Skin biopsies of purpuric lesions demonstrate the involvement of small vessels (primarily postcapillary venules) within the papillary dermis. The predominant cell types within the inflammatory infiltrate are neutrophils and monocytes. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Immunofluorescence studies show IgA, complement component 3 (C3), and fibrin deposition within the walls of involved vessels. IgA, C3, fibrin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), and, less commonly, immunoglobulin M (IgM) also are deposited within the endothelial and mesangial cells of the kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69895 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Attention has focused on the potential role of increased serum levels of IgA and IgA immune complexes in the pathogenesis of IgAV (HSP). In addition, several studies report alterations in the glycosylation of IgA, elevated levels of IgA anticardiolipin antibodies, and increased levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in patients with IgAV (HSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,29-33</a>]. The fact that only one of the two IgA subtypes (IgA1, but not IgA2) is found in the inflammatory infiltrates of this disease remains unexplained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Similarly, the precise role of IgA and the specific involvement of IgA1 in the pathogenesis of IgAV (HSP) remain unclear. Some research suggests that IgA anticardiolipin antibodies may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36,37</a>]. Results from one study suggest that beta-2-glycoprotein I (beta-2GPI) is an antigenic target for IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Despite the increased presence of these antibodies, there are few reports of thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS IN CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic tetrad of IgAV (HSP) includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura without thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Arthritis/arthralgia</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease</p><p/><p>These clinical manifestations may develop over the course of days to weeks and may vary in their order of presentation. Purpura and joint pain are usually the presenting symptoms, but this is not always the case. In the absence of the classic purpuric rash, the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) may not be obvious. Patients who present with significant joint or abdominal symptoms without the skin manifestations may be thought to have an infectious or surgical process. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The mean age of onset of IgAV (HSP) is between six and seven years. Based upon retrospective reviews from several different countries, the major clinical manifestations develop with the following frequencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,9-12,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9-12,39,40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purpura &ndash; Purpura is the presenting symptom in approximately three-quarters of patients, preceding other symptoms by a mean of four days in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Arthralgia/arthritis</span> &ndash; In most of the series, joint symptoms were the second most common manifestation, occurring in slightly over one-half to three-quarters of the patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain &ndash; Colicky pain occurred in approximately one-half of patients and gastrointestinal bleeding in approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease &ndash; The frequency of renal involvement ranged from 21 to 54 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rash is the presenting sign in approximately three-quarters of patients. The rash often begins with erythematous, macular, or urticarial wheals. The lesion may be itchy but are rarely painful. The wheals then coalesce and evolve into the typical ecchymoses, petechiae, and palpable purpura (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100110\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100110 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100109\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100109 \">picture 3</a>). The rash typically appears in crops, symmetrically distributed, and located primarily in <span class=\"nowrap\">gravity/pressure-dependent</span> areas, such as the lower extremities. The buttocks are often involved in toddlers and the face, trunk, and upper extremities in nonambulatory children.</p><p>Localized subcutaneous edema is a common feature that may be found in dependent and periorbital areas, especially in younger children (&lt;3 years of age) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100112\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100112 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98550\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98550 \">picture 5</a>). Even adult patients, however, may also have this manifestation of IgAV (HSP), particularly involving the dorsal aspect of the hands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthritis/arthralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Arthritis/arthralgia</span> occur in up to 84 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, joint complaints are uncommon as the sole symptom at presentation and are the presenting symptom in approximately 15 percent of patients.</p><p>The arthritis is usually transient or migratory, typically oligoarticular (one to four joints), and nondeforming. It usually affects the lower extremity large joints (hips, knees, and ankles) or less commonly the upper extremities (elbows, wrists, and hands) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,39</a>]. There is often prominent periarticular swelling and tenderness but usually without joint effusion, erythema, or warmth. Patients may have considerable pain and limitation of motion. Younger children with lower extremity involvement may refuse to ambulate. The arthritis does not cause any chronic damage or sequelae. It may precede the appearance of purpura, though usually by no more than one or two days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in approximately one-half of children with IgAV (HSP) and range from mild (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and transient paralytic ileus) to more significant findings (gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bowel ischemia and necrosis, intussusception, and bowel perforation). Guaiac-positive stool is found in up to 56 percent of patients, but massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The frequent presence of fecal occult blood, increased stool alpha-1-antitrypsin, and hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, even in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms, suggests that gastrointestinal involvement and mucosal injury are more common than the clinical history indicates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms typically develop within eight days of the appearance of the rash, although much longer intervals (weeks to months) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Gastrointestinal complaints precede the rash in approximately 15 to 35 percent of cases. In such patients, the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) is significantly more difficult. Gastrointestinal symptoms without the appearance of cutaneous purpura at any time also have been described in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. In one small, retrospective review of children who had skin biopsies, edema and rash above the waist were most common in patients who presented with gastrointestinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The reason for such a putative association is not clear<em>, </em>since the rash of IgAV (HSP) is typically found in <span class=\"nowrap\">gravity/pressure-dependent</span> areas. This finding will require confirmation in a larger cohort before it can be relied upon.</p><p>Gastrointestinal pain associated with IgAV (HSP) is caused by submucosal hemorrhage and edema. Purpuric lesions may be seen on endoscopy, commonly in the descending duodenum, stomach, and colon. The terminal ileum also may be involved. Submucosal edema, ulceration, and spasm of the ileum and jejunum may be seen in small bowel series. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-manifestations-of-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal manifestations of vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intussusception is the most common gastrointestinal complication of IgAV (HSP). Rarer gastrointestinal manifestations include acute pancreatitis, gall bladder involvement, bowel perforation, and, in children, protein-losing enteropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48-53</a>].</p><p>Edema and hemorrhage can act as a pathologic lead point, contributing to the development of intussusception. Intussusception is limited to the small bowel in approximately 60 percent of cases, in contrast to idiopathic intussusception, which is typically ileocolic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Intussusception in IgAV (HSP) has a reported overall incidence of 2.3 to 3.5 percent, although some retrospective series reported an incidence of only 0.4 to 0.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39,42</a>]. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the population studied. Children demonstrating severe gastrointestinal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> requiring hospitalization are presumably at greater risk.</p><p>In a retrospective review of 149 hospitalized children with IgAV (HSP) from two centers in Chicago, 63 patients (42 percent) presented with severe abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Four patients were diagnosed with intussusception, two of which were ileoileal intussusceptions. All four patients required surgical correction. Intussusception is discussed in greater detail separately.

It is more prevalent in older children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The most common presentation is hematuria with or without red blood cell casts and mild or no proteinuria. Nephrotic-range proteinuria, an elevated serum creatinine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension are present in a minority of patients. These findings, as well as the coexistence of hematuria and proteinuria, are associated with an increased risk of progressive disease, which occurs more frequently in adults. The findings on renal biopsy are identical to those in IgA nephropathy. The presence of microscopic papillary dermal edema and perivascular deposition of C3 on direct immunofluorescence of skin biopsy samples may be associated with development of renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Risk factors predicting renal involvement are not well known, but several clinical and laboratory features have been reported as renal disease risk factors. In one meta-analysis, old age; gastrointestinal symptoms; relapse; elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, and antistreptolysin O (ASLO) titer; and low C3 were reported as renal disease risk factors, and a scoring system for risk of renal disease development was suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Potential explanations for the high prevalence of substantial renal impairment in this study include the possibility of selection bias (all patients in the study had renal disease severe enough to require renal biopsy), the long period of follow-up compared with other studies, and the possible role of comorbidities (eg, hypertension) contributing to the progression of renal disease.

The diagnosis is straightforward when patients present with the classic signs and symptoms (palpable purpura of the lower extremities and buttocks in combination with two or more of the other typical disease manifestations). However, the classic rash of IgAV (HSP) is not the initial presenting sign in approximately one-quarter of affected individuals. It may be difficult to make the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) prior to the appearance of a rash in patients who present with other clinical manifestations, such as abdominal pain or arthritis, particularly in isolation. In patients with incomplete or unusual presentations, a biopsy of an affected organ (eg, skin or kidney) that demonstrates leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a predominance of IgA deposition confirms the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pediatric patients, biopsy is reserved for patients with an unusual presentation of IgAV (HSP) (ie, no rash, or an atypical rash) or those with significant renal disease.</p><p>Confirmation of the diagnosis by biopsy is more important in adult patients because of the lower incidence of IgAV (HSP) beyond the pediatric age group and the comparatively higher incidence of other forms of vasculitis that may be clinically similar to IgAV (HSP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsies of the skin, which sample the small blood vessels of the superficial dermis, are usually adequate to make the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP). Light microscopy studies (hematoxylin and eosin stains) demonstrate the classical leukocytoclastic vasculitis in postcapillary venules with IgA deposition that is pathognomonic of IgAV (HSP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52548%7ERHEUM%2F66296\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52548 graphicRef66296 \">image 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The biopsy should contain skin lesions that are less than 24 hours old because, in more chronic lesions, vessel damage leads to nonspecific leakage of all isotypes of immunoglobulin.

Other studies may be performed as part of the evaluation for disorders in the differential diagnosis. Some laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, are obtained once the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) is made but are not required for diagnosis.

These diseases include primary vasculitides (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's]), microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), and vascular inflammation secondary to a connective tissue disorder (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) or to an infectious disease (eg, hepatitis B or C).

Assays for serum complement, antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and rheumatoid factor are typically normal in patients with IgAV (HSP). Abnormal results for any of these studies may help to differentiate IgAV (HSP) from SLE and JIA, although at least 15 percent of patients with IgAV (HSP) may also have transient hypocomplementemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Evidence of a recent group A beta-hemolytic streptococci infection (eg, positive throat culture, positive rapid streptococcal antigen test, or elevated anti-streptolysin O [ASLO] titers) and the clinical course distinguish acute rheumatic fever from IgAV (HSP), with the caveat that a significant proportion of cases of IgAV (HSP) are triggered by streptococcal infections. Reactive arthritis may be triggered by a variety of genitourinary and gastrointestinal pathogens including beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections. Reactive arthritis may cause a painful polyarthritis and high fevers, but the characteristic rash of IgAV (HSP) should allow distinction between these conditions. Similarly, when considering toxic synovitis, another self-limited disease with transient joint findings that resolve without long-term sequelae, evolution of the other manifestations of IgAV (HSP) will help differentiate the two conditions.

In addition, the IgAV (HSP) rash may be a nonspecific erythematous or urticarial exanthem or limited to lesions on the buttocks or lower extremities early in the disease course. Thus, careful serial examinations of the entire child are essential when considering the diagnosis. Radiologic studies used to screen for surgical causes of abdominal pain are also used in patients with IgAV (HSP) who develop gastrointestinal complications, such as intussusception, bowel infarction, or perforation.

Renal disease is less prevalent in children, so serum creatinine need not be obtained unless the patient is hypertensive or has abnormalities on the urinalysis. Renal involvement often becomes detectable after other manifestations of IgAV (HSP), so urinary screening should be continued beyond the acute presentation.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgAV (HSP) occurs primarily between the ages of 3 and 15 years. The annual incidence is 10 to 20 per 100,000 in children &lt;17 years of age, with a peak incidence in children between four to six years of age. Approximately 10 percent of IgAV (HSP) cases occur in adults. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying cause of IgAV (HSP) is unknown. It is thought that IgAV (HSP) represents an immune-mediated vasculitis that may be triggered by a variety of antigens, including various infections and immunizations. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgAV (HSP) is a self-limited disease and is characterized by a tetrad of clinical manifestations that vary in their occurrence and order of presentation (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations in children'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Palpable purpura without thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arthralgia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) is usually based upon clinical manifestations of the disease. In patients with an incomplete or unusual presentation, biopsy of the affected organ (eg, skin or kidney) demonstrating predominantly IgA deposition supports the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is more difficult if there is an incomplete presentation of IgAV (HSP) or if the skin manifestations are absent at disease onset. In these circumstances, other causes for purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and renal disease must be considered. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no diagnostic tests for IgAV (HSP). Patients in whom the diagnosis is at all in doubt should have a complete blood count, prothrombin time (PT), and urinalysis. The presence of thrombocytopenia or a coagulopathy largely excludes the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP). A serum creatinine level should be obtained in children with hypertension or an abnormal urinalysis. Serum creatinine should be assayed in all adult patients with IgAV (HSP) because of the increased risk of significant renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26234502\" class=\"local\">'Renal studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal ultrasonography is indicated in patients with severe abdominal pain. It can detect increased bowel wall thickness, hematomas, peritoneal fluid, and intussusception. Contrast studies may miss intussusception in patients with IgAV (HSP).
