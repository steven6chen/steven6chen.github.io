The most common techniques prevent pregnancy by disrupting the patency of the fallopian tubes. This prevents conception by blocking transport of sperm from the lower genital tract to an ovulated oocyte.</p><p>Female sterilization may be performed immediately after childbirth (postpartum sterilization) or at a time unrelated to a pregnancy (interval sterilization). Among women in the United States, it is estimated that over 50 percent of sterilizations performed each year are in the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most postpartum sterilization procedures are performed via laparotomy, either through the cesarean laparotomy at the time of cesarean delivery or via minilaparotomy following vaginal delivery. Most interval sterilization procedures are performed via laparoscopy.</p><p>This topic review will focus on postpartum sterilization. An overview of general principles of female sterilization as well as laparoscopic and hysteroscopic sterilization are discussed elsewhere.

Among women in the United States, it is estimated that over 50 percent of sterilizations performed each year are in the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A routine part of prenatal care is to discuss contraceptive options including postpartum sterilization early in the third trimester; this allows for adequate time for the woman to make a decision. For women who have federally funded health insurance, the federal sterilization consent form must be reviewed, signed, and dated between 30 and 180 days prior to the sterilization procedure; therefore, the discussion should not be deferred to the end of pregnancy.</p><p>Since the decision to undergo postpartum sterilization is made a period of time before the procedure, the decision should be reaffirmed before proceeding, typically at the time of surgical consent. Women who undergo postpartum sterilization have an increased risk of sterilization regret [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-female-sterilization#H103521971\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Preoperative counseling'</a>.)</p><p>Despite previous expressed desire for sterilization, factors which may alter the patient's certainty for sterilization at the time of delivery may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm delivery or other pregnancy complications that may affect the health of the neonate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in socioeconomic or relationship status</p><p/><p>In addition to the usual preoperative assessment for surgical morbidity, obstetric factors should be considered, including postpartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, or peripartum infection. It is possible, but more challenging, to perform minilaparotomy for postpartum sterilization on patients with obesity, prior abdominoplasty, and other prior abdominal surgery. These technical factors should be considered when advising patients prenatally about their contraceptive options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813256629\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sterilization following vaginal delivery is generally performed within the first 24 to 48 hours after delivery, at which time the uterine fundus is found at the level of the umbilicus. The procedure can be safely performed up to six days postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is no increased surgical risk of performing the sterilization immediately after delivery as compared with later in the patient's hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The 24- to 48-hour time period is preferred for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The procedure is performed before significant uterine involution has occurred. This allows use of an infraumbilical incision, which has favorable cosmetic results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient had epidural anesthesia for delivery, and postpartum tubal sterilization can be performed within the time frame the epidural catheter can be safely and effectively left in place as advised by the anesthesiologist, the epidural catheter can be used to administer anesthesia for the sterilization procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient cannot eat or drink for a period of hours before the procedure, so if the procedure is delayed, this can be difficult for the patient.</p><p/><p>For women having a cesarean delivery, sterilization is performed concomitant with the cesarean.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813256549\"><span class=\"h2\">Logistics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may be logistical barriers to performing a desired postpartum sterilization. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate coverage of other laboring patients to allow the patient's clinician to perform a sterilization procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate anesthesia or nursing staff.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate operating room availability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, for patients covered by Medicaid, lack of the federal sterilization form that is correctly signed and dated between 30 days and 180 days prior to the procedure, as well as availability of the form at the time of desired sterilization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813255421\"><span class=\"h2\">Late or deferred postpartum sterilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on these clinical or logistical issues, it is estimated that only approximately 50 percent of women requesting postpartum sterilizations receive them, and there are notable disparities between women who do and do not successfully receive sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. One study found that women with unfulfilled sterilization requests are more likely to be younger, African-American, have requested sterilization during the second trimester, and have had vaginal deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another study found that those most likely to obtain a postpartum sterilization were married women, women with lower parity, and women with private insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A review of one institution's requests for sterilizations after vaginal deliveries found that 52 percent of women received their requested sterilization, and that of those with unfulfilled requests, almost half (44 percent) were unfulfilled due to lack of valid federally mandated consent. This study also found that body mass index &ge;40 was an independent predictor of unfilled sterilization requests among those with adequate consent documentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Women with high-risk pregnancies are more likely to request postpartum sterilization, but have similar rates of fulfilled requests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Deferral of sterilization may result in unwanted, and for some women, potentially high-risk unplanned pregnancies. If there is a potential for a deferral due to logistical issues, the woman's risk of unplanned pregnancy and her likelihood of returning for an interval procedure should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-female-sterilization#H11785721\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Postpartum versus interval'</a>.)</p><p>If a desired sterilization procedure is not performed in the hospital, most providers consider prescribing a long-acting reversible contraceptive and proceeding with laparoscopic sterilization six weeks following delivery. This is based on the generally accepted notion that, by six weeks postpartum, the uterus has completely involuted and pregnancy physiology has resolved. One study, which evaluated the safety of laparoscopic tubal sterilization within five days of vaginal delivery (n = 2233) as compared with postpartum minilaparotomy (n = 5095) or interval laparoscopic sterilization (n = 20,325), found no greater risk of major or minor complications for postpartum compared with interval laparoscopic tubal ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There are no data specifically on the safety of laparoscopic sterilization between two and six weeks postpartum, or comparisons of less than six weeks to greater than six weeks. Given the arbitrary nature of the six-week postpartum timeframe, it seems likely that interval sterilization done earlier than six weeks is safe, and some authors have argued that an interval of 30 days is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813257000\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpartum sterilization after a vaginal delivery is performed via an infraumbilical minilaparotomy. Postpartum laparoscopic sterilization has been reported; however, it has not gained widespread acceptance, likely because of the general ease of minilaparotomy and the additional time and equipment for laparoscopy that is often not found on a labor and delivery unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The patient is administered regional or general anesthesia and placed in supine position. The bladder is drained with an indwelling catheter, and sterile skin preparation is performed.</p><p>An essential step, regardless of approach, is the correct identification of the fallopian tubes, which may be more difficult in the setting of prior pelvic surgery, endometriosis, or uterine anomalies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2213311\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approach</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813257244\"><span class=\"h3\">Minilaparotomy following vaginal delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical sterilization after vaginal delivery is most commonly performed using an infraumbilical minilaparotomy. This is minimally invasive and results in favorable cosmetic results, because the scar is generally not very obvious at that site.</p><p>For postpartum sterilization following vaginal delivery, a 2 to 3 cm transverse or semicircular incision (minilaparotomy) is created in the infraumbilical fold, at the level of the uterine fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F104657\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104657 \">figure 1</a>). Once the peritoneum is identified and opened, the surgeon's finger is used to palpate the uterine fundus, and sweeping laterally towards the adnexa, gently hooks under the fallopian tube to bring it toward the midline incision. Maneuvers that can assist in bringing the adnexa toward midline include tilting the operative bed toward the operating surgeon, and directing the assistant to use external pressure on the enlarged postpartum uterus for stabilization. Retractors placed into the incision can assist in identification of the fallopian tubes, or a small self-retaining, flexible, circular retractor can be placed.</p><p>Once identified, a Babcock clamp is then placed into the incision to grasp the tube, and the tube is elevated out of the abdomen. At this point, it is essential to follow the fallopian tube out to its fimbriated end for confirmation, using two Babcock clamps to march along the length of the tube. Tubal sterilization failure can result from resection of the wrong structure, typically the round ligament or a fold of the broad ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Next, the surgeon should identify a 2 cm segment of tube in the mid-isthmus, using transillumination to identify an avascular space in the mesosalpinx beneath the area for planned resection. The Babcock clamp is placed to elevate this portion of the tube, and one of the described methods of partial salpingectomy is performed to ensure resection and hemostasis. Care should be taken to remove a segment in the midline of the fallopian tube, as resection of distal segments toward the fimbria may lead to risk of tubal recanalization and higher failure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The contralateral fallopian tube is then identified and resected using the same technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813257020\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparotomy with cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical sterilization adds only a few minutes to the cesarean section procedure and no additional incisions are needed. At time of cesarean section, tubal sterilization is performed after delivery of the fetus and closure of the hysterotomy. If the uterus is externalized, the fallopian tubes are easily identified; if the uterus is left in situ, retractors are needed, along with lateral displacement of the uterus, in order to visualize one fallopian tube at a time.</p><p>The same technique described for minilaparotomy should be followed to grasp and identify the tubal segment planned for resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813257393\"><span class=\"h3\">Interval laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The focus of this topic is postpartum sterilization, but in many countries, minilaparotomy for interval sterilization is performed. For interval minilaparotomy, the location of the incision is in the suprapubic area, rather than infraumbilical, and may require a slightly larger incision of 3 to 5 cm. A uterine manipulator or uterine elevator can be employed to lift the fundus into view and facilitate identification of the fallopian tubes. This procedure is commonly employed outside of the United States, often using local anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311209845\"><span class=\"h2\">Tubal occlusion methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are various methods of salpingectomy for sterilization. Partial salpingectomy is traditionally performed; however, there is increasing interest in excisional methods, promoted by recommendations for complete salpingectomy as a potential strategy for ovarian cancer prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-female-sterilization#H1311209659\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Ovarian cancer prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2213297\"><span class=\"h3\">Choosing a method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of options for the method of tubal occlusion used for postpartum sterilization. Partial salpingectomy is the preferred method. We do not routinely advise complete salpingectomy based on concerns regarding increased risk of bleeding and against titanium clip placement because of data regarding low efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H1311210329\" class=\"local\">'Complete salpingectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1813257819\" class=\"local\">'Titanium clip'</a> below.)</p><p>Ultimately, the specific method of partial salpingectomy employed for postpartum sterilization is based on the surgeon's experience and preference, given that there are no data to support one method of partial salpingectomy over another. In our practice, we find the Pomeroy or Parkland methods to be the most time efficient. In general, we prefer the Parkland method because the end result allows visualization of the tubal stumps divided and secured at a distance of 2 to 3 cm apart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311210265\"><span class=\"h3\">Partial salpingectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical techniques for partial salpingectomy commonly involve resection of a tubal segment at least 2 cm in length. Removal of a segment of tube results in eventual scarring and closure of the tubal remnants. The tube and sutures should be handled carefully while inspecting the cut ends. Care should be taken to ensure replacement of the tube (or uterus, if externalized at cesarean section) back into the abdominal cavity does not result in displacement of the sutures securing the tubal stumps. The tubal segments removed should be sent for pathology evaluation, separately labeled as &quot;left fallopian tube&quot; and &quot;right fallopian tube,&quot; for confirmation of excision of the full thickness of the tube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311210271\"><span class=\"h4\">Pomeroy technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The steps of the Pomeroy tubal sterilization technique are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F104608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104608 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75414%7EOBGYN%2F51325%7EOBGYN%2F64088\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75414 graphicRef51325 graphicRef64088 \">figure 3A-C</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mid-isthmic portion of the tube is elevated and folded at the midpoint and the distal and proximal ends of the tube brought together. The tube is ligated by tying one or two rapidly absorbing sutures around the entire double thickness of the tube. Pomeroy originally described use of chromic ties; however, now many surgeons use a &quot;modified&quot; Pomeroy technique and employ plain gut for its more rapid absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The folded portion of the tube is sharply excised. Care should be taken to remove an adequate segment of tube. However, there should be an adequate margin between the suture and the cut end to prevent the cut ends of the tube from slipping out of the suture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cut ends of the tube are inspected to visualize the tubal lumen; this confirms resection of a full thickness of the tube.</p><p/><p>As the tubal stumps heal, the suture absorbs and the ends fall apart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76868\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76868 \">figure 4</a>).

Two free ties of absorbable suture (0 chromic or plain gut) are passed through the opening and one strand is used to ligate the proximal end of the tube and the other to ligate the distal end of the tube. The ends can be doubly ligated to ensure hemostasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2 cm segment is sharply excised between the sutures.

Use of the Irving or Uchida techniques is feasible at time of cesarean section, but would be more difficult to accomplish through a minilaparotomy incision.</p><p>Both the Uchida and Irving techniques involve burying a tubal stump in a nearby structure. They were developed to minimize risk of tuboperitoneal fistula formation and pregnancy following tubal ligation, which may occur in up to 1 percent of women following a partial salpingectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These techniques are believed to be more effective than the Pomeroy or Parkland techniques, but have not been directly compared. In our practice, we have used these techniques following failed tubal sterilization, at time of cesarean section when complete salpingectomy is not feasible or riskier due to increased vascularity in the gravid uterus. However, there are no data that allow comparison of efficacy between these techniques and traditional methods used for postpartum sterilization. In China, the Uchida technique is widely used as an interval method of sterilization via laparotomy and is reported to have comparable efficacy to sterilization via use of a &quot;silver clip&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In brief, the techniques involve ligation and excision of the midportion of the tube followed by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irving technique &ndash; The proximal tubal stump is then inserted into an incision in the myometrium and sutured securely to bury the stump within the myometrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F104612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104612 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uchida method &ndash; The utero-tubal serosa is hydrodissected, the proximal tubal stump is pulled into the mesosalpinx, and the peritoneum is closed over the cut end of the tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F104613\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104613 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311210309\"><span class=\"h5\">Distal fimbriectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal fimbriectomy alone is not recommended as a method of sterilization because higher failure rates were reported historically, presumably related to risk of patent residual tubal lumens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311210329\"><span class=\"h3\">Complete salpingectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete salpingectomy is an option for postpartum sterilization. Interest in opportunistic salpingectomy has increased the reported practice of salpingectomy at time of cesarean section. In a large Northern California health care system, utilization of salpingectomy increased between 2011 and 2016 from 3.3 to 9.2 percent at time of cesarean section, and from 0 to 4.5 percent when performed immediately postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A retrospective case series at a single institution described no difference in operative time or in rate of short-term complications between patients undergoing partial (n = 99) or complete salpingectomy (n = 50) at time of cesarean section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A small series of patients randomized to complete or partial salpingectomy at time of cesarean section demonstrated comparable safety with no difference in postpartum measurement of ovarian reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, no studies have compared contraceptive efficacy between complete or partial salpingectomy for postpartum sterilization. Partial salpingectomy methods are highly effective, and likely require less surgical dissection and risk of bleeding or injury to proximal structures. For postpartum women, we currently do not routinely perform complete bilateral salpingectomy for tubal sterilization due to concern for additional bleeding from enlarged postpartum vasculature and lack of proven benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-female-sterilization#H1311210395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Salpingectomy'</a>.)</p><p>The increased interest in complete salpingectomy is based on a potential beneficial effect of salpingectomy on ovarian cancer risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-female-sterilization#H1311209659\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Ovarian cancer prevention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1813257819\"><span class=\"h3\">Titanium clip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suture has been traditionally used in postpartum sterilization methods. Use of the titanium clip (Filshie clip) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F101888\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101888 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F101890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101890 \">figure 8</a>) has been proposed, but the sterilization failure rate with the clip appears to be unacceptably high.</p><p>There has been some interest in use of the titanium clip based on ease of use and shorter operative duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the titanium clip is not as effective as partial salpingectomy for postpartum sterilization. This was shown in a randomized trial (n = 1400) comparing the titanium clip with the Pomeroy method in the postpartum period. The failure rate at 24 months was significantly higher for the clip (1.7 versus 0.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A major limitation of this trial was a high rate of loss to follow-up of just over 50 percent in both groups. In addition, a systematic review that included the data from the above trial as well as eight other comparative and non-comparative observational studies found that failure rates for postpartum sterilization with the titanium clip ranged from no failures to 8.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-sterilization/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Given these data, we recommend against the use of the titanium clip for postpartum sterilization.</p><p>The titanium clip is commonly used for laparoscopic sterilization. This is discussed in detail separately.

In addition, the tubal stump should be gently replaced into the abdomen (or carefully observed while replacing the uterus into the abdomen if externalized at time of cesarean section) to avoid trauma and slippage of the sutures that might result in excess bleeding or even need for reoperation. Additional potential complications are discussed separately.

Postpartum sterilization is typically performed within 24 to 48 hours following a vaginal delivery or at the time of cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1311209740\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only indication for sterilization is the patient's desire for permanent contraception. There are no medical conditions that are strictly incompatible with postpartum sterilization via minilaparotomy; however, there may be factors that make women more suitable for a particular route of sterilization or other contraceptive options. (See <a href=\"#H1311209831\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The option of sterilization should be offered and discussed with pregnant women early in the third trimester of pregnancy as a routine part of counseling regarding postpartum contraception. Logistical barriers may delay or prevent performance of a desired postpartum sterilization. Unfortunately this may lead to higher rates of unplanned pregnancy, and unfulfilled requests for postpartum sterilization are more common following vaginal delivery and appear to disproportionately impact women who are younger or African-American. (See <a href=\"#H1813256441\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal counseling and obstetric care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1813255421\" class=\"local\">'Late or deferred postpartum sterilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgical approach for postpartum sterilization depends on the route of delivery. The procedure is performed through the cesarean laparotomy at the time of cesarean delivery. Postpartum sterilization after a vaginal delivery is performed via an infraumbilical minilaparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H2213311\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a variety of options for the method of tubal occlusion used for postpartum sterilization. For women undergoing postpartum sterilization (see <a href=\"#H2213297\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a method'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial salpingectomy is the most commonly used method. There are several technique for partial salpingectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1311210265\" class=\"local\">'Partial salpingectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend <strong>NOT</strong> using the titanium clip (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1813257819\" class=\"local\">'Titanium clip'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, we find the Pomeroy or Parkland methods to be the most time efficient. In general, we prefer the Parkland method because the end result allows visualization of the tubal stumps divided and secured at a distance of 2 to 3 cm apart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all methods, it is essential to correctly identify the fallopian tubes to ensure that the correct structure is occluded and thereby avoid a failed sterilization procedure. Following partial salpingectomy, final pathology reports should be reviewed to confirm that the tubal cross-section is documented for both specimens. If not confirmed, the patient will need to be advised that the sterilization was not successful and that an alternate contraceptive method is needed. (See <a href=\"#H1813257000\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1311209958\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of complications following postpartum salpingectomy by minilaparotomy is overall very low. Care should be taken to prevent trauma to the secured tubal stumps to avoid excess blood loss. (See <a href=\"#H1311209934\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study, the 10-year failure rate for postpartum partial salpingectomy was 7.5 per 1000 procedures. This was lower than other methods, although all methods had a failure rate of &lt;1 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54215 \">table 2</a>).
