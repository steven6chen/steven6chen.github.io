A complex cytokine network is involved in normal immune function, and this network is comprised of positive and negative feedback loops that enhance or suppress the response. Many immune-mediated diseases (especially rheumatic diseases) involve the abnormal regulation of cytokines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55029 \">table 1</a>). This can be manifested either by defective production of suppressive factors or by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52469\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52469 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, understanding cytokine regulation abnormalities in these diseases could ultimately lead to novel and specific treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytokine networks in rheumatic diseases: Implications for therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues relating to the role of cytokines in rheumatic diseases are reviewed here. Overviews of the effects of cytokines on the immune response and the therapeutic implications of cytokine networks in rheumatic disease are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in the immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytokine networks in rheumatic diseases: Implications for therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is more information on the role of cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than in any other rheumatic disease. In addition, these studies have led to clinical trials with several novel agents designed to interrupt the cytokine network of RA. Anticytokine therapy has shown clear evidence of clinical efficacy, especially with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha directed approaches. In general, T cell-derived factors are not as prominent as macrophage and fibroblast cytokines in the rheumatoid joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interferon (IFN)-gamma was the initial target of cytokine research in RA. This was due, in part, to the availability of sensitive IFN bioassays. The synovial fluid of patients with RA demonstrated IFN-like activity using viral cytopathic inhibition assays, which take advantage of the fact that interferons protect cells from viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression in RA synovium also suggested the presence of IFN-gamma, since this cytokine was the most potent DR inducer known. These observations, along with later studies demonstrating putative interleukin (IL)-2 activity in synovial effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and the presence of T-cell surface markers associated with activation (major histocompatibility complex [MHC] DR+, VLA4+, CD69+), tended to support the hypothesis that the T cells in RA were highly activated and that the local milieu contained significant concentrations of T cell derived cytokines.</p><p>Subsequently, however, this view had to be reconsidered when specific immunoassays demonstrated only limited amounts of IFN-gamma in RA joints, far below that typically required to induce HLA-DR expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The IFN-like activity that was detected in joints was actually due to non-IFN factors (demonstrating the vagaries of bioassays).</p><p>The relatively low expression of IFN-gamma in RA is especially striking when it is compared with diseases known to be caused by T cells, such as tuberculous pleuritis. Substantial quantities of IFN-gamma and other T cell factors can be detected in these pleural effusions and may provide a yardstick for comparing cytokine production in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The situation is similar with many other T cell factors in RA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82355 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cytokines produced by the Th2 subset of T cells, including IL-4, are conspicuously absent. Th1 cytokines other than IFN-gamma are present to some degree, although in very small quantities. As an example, immunoassays have failed to detect significant amounts of IL-2 in synovial fluid, although RNA transcripts of T cell cytokines can be detected using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Only small amounts of most T cell cytokines have been detected in synovial fluid or synovial tissues.</p><p>One exception is IL-17, a Th17 cell-derived cytokine that exhibits many of the same activities as IL-1 and TNF-alpha, and acts in synergy with these cytokines in particular. Thus, IL-17 can independently increase production of metalloproteinases and inducible nitric oxide synthase in synoviocytes. More importantly, it can interact synergistically with IL-1 to greatly amplify its activity within the rheumatoid joint. In one study of 43 patients with RA and 20 controls, for example, the synovial fluid level of IL-17 was significantly higher in those with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. IL-17 may be of particular importance in up-regulating the expression of the protein known variously as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-ligand), tumor necrosis factor&ndash;related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE), and osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF), which, in turn, is partially responsible for activating osteoclasts and thereby promoting bone erosion. It is not clear whether the majority of the synovial IL-17 production is derived from T cells, although IL-17 is a product of the Th17 cell subset; more IL-17 appears to come from mast cells than T cells under some circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is also interest in the expression of other cytokines that act via common gamma chain cytokine receptors (eg, IL-17 and IL-21). IL-21, an IL-2-like cytokine that is produced by T cells, has a functional role in amplification of many effector immune cells, particularly in Th17 responses.</p><p>T cell products are generally present only at low levels in the rheumatoid joint. There are several possible explanations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The local production of suppressive factors and cytokine inhibitors may overwhelm the activating effects of antigens or <span class=\"nowrap\">macrophage/fibroblast</span> cytokines in chronic arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small amounts of cytokines produced in the microenvironment might be sufficient to sustain synovial inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokines may be inactivated by proteases derived from the neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the synovial fluid and thus harder to detect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial T cells may have not been activated by their specific antigen. This is almost certainly true for the majority of T cells in the joint, since recruitment into the joint is mediated by antigen-independent processes like chemokines and adhesion molecules. Antigen-specific cells at an inflamed site comprise only a small percentage of the total number of T cells, perhaps less than 1 percent of lymphocytes in established disease. These cells might release cytokines into the microenvironment in amounts below the sensitivity of available assays, yet still be able to orchestrate a local response. Alternatively, cytokines might not be released by these activated cells but remain bound to cell membranes. However, this possibility is less likely, since T cell-derived IFN-gamma and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are abundant in other inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis and asthma.</p><p/><p>Direct cell-cell contacts between T cells and macrophages that are independent of T cell cytokine expression may also be important in the pathogenesis of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Macrophage and fibroblast cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to T cell cytokines, products secreted by activated macrophages and fibroblasts, such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, GM-CSF, M-CSF, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and a host of chemotactic cytokines known as chemokines (eg, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inhibitory protein-1, and epithelial-neutrophil activating peptide [ENA-78]) are abundant in synovial fluids and synovial tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Interleukin-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IL-1 is one of the primary pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA. It is present in RA synovial fluid and in culture supernatants of RA synovial cells. High affinity receptors for IL-1 are also expressed by human rheumatoid synovial cells.</p><p>Synovial macrophages are the major source of IL-1 in RA synovium, and more than one-half of these cells contain IL-1 mRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Immunohistologic studies confirm this observation, with abundant IL-1 protein detected in synovial lining macrophages. IL-1 production in RA is enhanced by a variety of soluble factors, including TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, immunoglobulin Fc fragments, collagen fragments, and, to a lesser extent, immune complexes.</p><p>IL-1 has many activities that are relevant to RA, including inducing prostaglandin and collagenase production. It also regulates fibroblast proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], stimulates synovial cell synthesis of IL-6, chemokines, and GM-CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and enhances collagen production. In addition, IL-1 stimulates glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis in human synovial fibroblast cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], serves as a chemotactic factor for B and T cells, and induces adhesion molecule expression (eg, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1) on fibroblast-like synoviocytes and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The hierarchical primacy of IL-1 is challenged, however, by the relative lack of efficacy of IL-1 blockade in RA; nevertheless, it remains a likely effector that contributes to joint destruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor necrosis factor-alpha</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TNF-alpha was originally characterized by its ability to cause necrosis in certain tumors in mice. It is now known to also be a potent proinflammatory and immunoregulatory mediator with considerable importance in rheumatic diseases. TNF-alpha stimulates endothelial cell activation and angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and thus enhances cellular recruitment and tissue retention, provokes collagenase and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by human synovial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], induces bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], inhibits bone formation and proteoglycan synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and stimulates resorption of proteoglycan. IL-1 and TNF-alpha share many activities, including the ability to enhance cytokine production, adhesion molecule expression, proliferation, and metalloproteinase production by cultured synoviocytes.</p><p>TNF-alpha is present in rheumatoid synovial fluid and serum, and levels of TNF-alpha correlate with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and synovial fluid leukocyte counts. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry indicate that TNF-alpha, like IL-1, is primarily a product of synovial macrophages in RA.</p><p>TNF-alpha blockade demonstrated some efficacy in animal models of arthritis, like collagen-induced arthritis in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, studies using monoclonal antibodies that inactivate TNF-alpha suggested that this approach would be useful in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Subsequent clinical trials have proven the efficacy of anti-TNF therapies in RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'TNF inhibition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20354882\"><span class=\"h3\">Interleukin-6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with effects upon a wide range of leukocytes. It is highly upregulated in the RA joint, a product of macrophages and fibroblasts predominantly but also of B cells and T cells. It also plays a crucial role in regulating the acute phase response and many of the systemic features of RA, including fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and altered hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function. A proof of concept comes in the licensing and wide use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-6R and thereby interferes with the function of IL-6. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other cytokines, predominantly expressed by macrophages are present in rheumatoid synovium. These include IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-12 promotes the development of T cells into a Th1 phenotype.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-15 has pleiotropic activities including activation of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and other macrophages.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-18 also activates T cells, neutrophils, and fibroblasts.</p><p/><p>These three cytokines are synergistic in their activities. GM-CSF and M-CSF are both expressed in RA synovium and have a role therein driving macrophage maturation and subset differentiation. They may also activate macrophage cytokine production, neutrophils, and neutrophil migration. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies that target GM-CSF and its receptor are under clinical development with encouraging data emerging. Other macrophage-derived cytokines like IL-23 have been variably described, although their presence has been most inconsistent across studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Local cytokine inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cytokine network in RA should be considered as a &quot;network in flux,&quot; in which positive and negative effects of different cytokines are integrated so as to sustain a chronic inflammatory state. Thus, cytokine inhibitors are also present in RA synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although they apparently are not produced in sufficient quantities to interrupt the cytokine network. One example is IL-1ra, which is a natural inhibitor of IL-1. Even though IL-1ra is expressed by synovial macrophages, it is a relatively weak inhibitor and the amount produced is apparently only a fraction of that required to inhibit synovial IL-1 activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Human recombinant IL-1ra has proven to have efficacy in RA treatment, although it benefits only a small proportion of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'IL-1 inhibition'</a>.)</p><p>The suppressive cytokines IL-10, IL-13, IL-35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and TGF-beta (though this cytokine should be considered to have a mixed effector profile) are also detected in the synovium and, by virtue of their functional profiles, can in theory dampen the local cytokine response. Their concentrations or activities, however, are not sufficient to control rheumatoid synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>In addition, otherwise suppressive cytokines may contribute to joint destruction. TGF-beta treatment in vitro, for example, augmented expression of collagenase-3 (MMP 13) by chondrocytes in cartilage from patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]; TGF-beta was also shown to inhibit CD95-mediated apoptosis of rheumatoid synovial cells in vitro, thus potentially augmenting pannus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Moreover, TGF-beta can potentially promote local Th17 responses.</p><p>The lack of IL-4 also contributes to the inflammatory process, since it can suppress synoviocyte activation by IL-1 and TNF-alpha. Thus, the relative absence (as opposed to the presence) of some T cell factors might actually contribute to the perpetuation of chronic RA. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 or IL-10, can decrease joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis. As a result, therapeutic modalities designed to increase production of Th2 cytokines might be useful in RA. In one example of this approach, IL-10 gene expression was enhanced in RA synovial tissue explants by using an adenoviral construct encoding the IL-10 gene in the severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This led to decreased cartilage invasion by the synovium and reduced expression of metalloproteinases. One intriguing possibility is that the lack of IL-2 in the synovial membrane may contribute to failure of the regulatory T cells, Tregs, found therein to mediate effective immune suppression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Implications of the cytokine network in RA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dissection of the cytokine network in RA has led to the notion that positive feedback loops contribute to the perpetuation of synovial inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82586\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82586 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-1 and TNF-alpha, both of which are produced by synovial macrophages, stimulate fibroblast proliferation and increase production of IL-6, IL-8 (and other chemoattractant molecules known as chemokines), GM-CSF, and destructive enzymes such as stromelysin and collagenase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GM-CSF, which is produced by synovial macrophages and activated fibroblasts, is a potent inducer of IL-1, TNF-alpha and IL-8 secretion. GM-CSF, especially in combination with TNF-alpha, also activates macrophages and induces HLA-DR expression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibroblast-like cells produce autocrine stimulation and contribute to their own dysregulation through the elaboration of growth factors like fibroblast growth factor. Similar cells derived from the synovium of patients with RA also produce macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a cytokine which stimulates production of TNF-alpha from macrophages in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Other cell types (eg, T cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells) also produce MIF, and fibroblast-like synovial cells respond to this cytokine with increased expression of proinflammatory and proteolytic factors (eg, phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase 2, and metalloproteinases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Compared with those with osteoarthritis, increased amounts of MIF have been found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The local production of cytokines by macrophages and fibroblasts induces angiogenesis, increases adhesion molecule expression, and recruits other inflammatory cells with chemotactic signals. Thus, providing the potential for positive feedback and perpetuation of inflammation.</p><p/><p>The cytokine network in RA suggests that this disease might not be strictly an autoimmune process in its clinically evident phase (as opposed to the pre-RA phase now recognized to precede arthritis onset that is characterized by autoimmunity and increasing systemic inflammation). The relative paucity of T cell factors in the joint and the presence of potent endogenous T cell suppressive agents (eg, IL-10 and TGF-beta) indicate that chronic RA is more complex, likely reflecting innate, adaptive, and stromal-dependent immune pathways. This conclusion has important therapeutic implications, since T cell-specific therapies have met with only modest success in RA aside from the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>. T cell suppression might be more useful during the initial phases of RA when there is evidence of an antigen-driven process but appears to be less applicable in late disease. Greater success at this stage results from therapy directed at the macrophages and fibroblasts, which are known to be activated and produce abundant cytokines, proteases, and prostaglandins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disease marked by B cell hyperreactivity and production of autoantibodies. Circulating immune complexes comprised of autoantibodies and antigen can lead to end organ disease, as with renal deposition of immune complexes containing anti-DNA antibodies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>). While the precise role of cytokines in this disease is not as well understood as in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), several cytokine abnormalities have been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon-alpha</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perhaps the most striking cytokine abnormality in SLE is the presence of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in serum. Most patients have significant levels, whereas normal individuals have little or no circulating IFN-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Furthermore, the IFN-alpha observed among patients with SLE is unusual in that it is acid labile (all other types of IFN-alpha are acid-stable), a phenomenon that has also been observed in human immunodeficiency virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Acid lability is conferred by a circulating factor in SLE serum (possibly a protease or an IFN binding protein) that interacts with acid-stable IFN-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The relative proportion of IFN-alpha that is acid labile seems to correlate with disease activity, with higher levels during flares and a reversion to an acid-stable form during clinical remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Elevated serum levels of IFN-alpha especially correlate with skin disease in SLE. Other laboratory parameters known to correlate with disease activity also correlate with high titers of IFN-alpha, including hypocomplementemia, lymphopenia, and anti-DNA antibodies. IFN-alpha is also probably responsible for lupus inclusions (tubuloreticular structures) present within some leukocytes that are comprised of a novel 36 kD protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>It is unclear what leads to the elevated circulating levels of IFN-alpha. One hypothesis suggests that viral infection, ultraviolet light, and other insults cause some cells to undergo apoptosis; apoptotic cells produce substances that induce the production of IFN-alfa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Immune complexes of nuclear antigens from dying cells and antinuclear antibodies may also stimulate dendritic cells to secrete IFN-alfa, the presence of which stimulates antibody production. The potential for positive feedback is present if autoantibody production is thus enhanced.</p><p>In contrast to IFN-alpha, only one-third of patients have detectable IFN-gamma in serum. The levels tend to be very low and do not correlate with disease activity.</p><p>Surprisingly, circulating anti-IFN-alpha antibodies are also found in the sera of about 5 to 10 percent of patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These antibodies neutralize IFN-alpha, but not IFN-beta or -gamma. Most patients with anti-IFN-alpha antibodies have inactive disease, leading to speculation that blocking IFN activity in SLE might contribute to clinical remissions.</p><p>The role of IFN-alpha in SLE is increasingly implicated as a general amplificatory factor in promoting disease pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Several studies have now shown evidence of an IFN-response signature in active disease; that is, circulating leukocytes exhibit RNA expression that suggests that many IFN-responsive genes have been activated. Parenteral administration of IFN-alpha to humans can lead to fever, malaise, alopecia, and myalgias, which also occur in lupus. These signs and symptoms, however, are very nonspecific. Lymphopenia is another side effect of IFN-alpha administration, and the degree of lymphopenia correlates with the amount of IFN-alpha in serum in SLE. Clinical studies in which inhibitors of type I IFN or of the IFN receptor have been administered to people with SLE suggest that clinical benefits can accrue, further implicating the IFN pathway as having a functionally important role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor necrosis factor-alpha</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has been detected in the serum of about 25 percent of SLE patients but not in control sera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. There is no correlation between the concentration of TNF and disease activity. In addition, two reports of TNF-alpha production by peripheral blood cells suggest that SLE patients actually have <strong>low</strong> TNF production.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first study, TNF produced by stimulated blood mononuclear cells was lower in patients with SLE than in matched controls, especially in patients with active nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second study also compared TNF production by blood mononuclear cells from normals and patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This study divided normal individuals into three groups based upon TNF production (high, intermediate, and low). Serial measurements indicated that the TNF phenotype for a particular individual was stable over time. Analysis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) associations with TNF phenotype showed that most low TNF-alpha producers possessed the human leukocyte antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(HLA)-DR2/DQwl</span> phenotype. In contrast, HLA-DR3 and DR4 were strongly associated with high TNF-alpha production. The SLE patients with the low TNF-alpha phenotype had an unusually high incidence of nephritis.</p><p/><p>Both studies suggest that a subpopulation of SLE patients have diminished capacity to synthesize TNF-alpha and that this population has a distinctive HLA genotype that correlates with renal disease. In addition, the serum of patients with SLE contains high levels of soluble TNF receptors that can neutralize the biologic activity of circulating TNF-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Interleukin-2 and interleukin-2 receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interleukin (IL)-2 is a T cell-derived cytokine that plays a central role in immune responses by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inducing the proliferation of T cells &ndash; The amplification of regulatory T cells has been identified as a primary role for IL-2</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participating in the activation and differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modulating macrophage function and phenotype</p><p/><p>IL-2 receptors are normally expressed at low levels on a variety of cells, including B cells, activated T cells, and monocytes. The receptor has several components, one of which can be shed from cells in a soluble form (IL-2R alpha). The soluble IL-2 receptor has very low affinity to IL-2 and is therefore an inefficient IL-2 inhibitor with limited capacity for absorbing excess IL-2.</p><p>IL-2 levels in serum are increased in about one-half of patients with active SLE, but not when patients are in remission. Treatment of patients with glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> corrects the IL-2 defect. In vitro production of IL-2 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, however, is essentially normal in lupus patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>The presence of soluble IL-2R in serum also appears to be a marker for disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. About one-third of patients with SLE have elevated serum levels of soluble IL-2R, and a significant correlation exists between disease flares and the soluble IL-2R concentration. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypocomplementemia, and proteinuria correlate with soluble IL-2R levels in the blood, although complement levels and DNA antibodies do not. As a result, the measurement of soluble IL-2R has potential as a method to monitor disease activity, but further studies are needed to assess its utility. Increasingly, IL-2 is considered to be a required regulator, and, as such, there are now several studies in patients indicating that low-dose IL-2 therapy can amplify regulatory T cells in patients. As such, it may be that IL-2 is relatively deficient at the functional level in SLE patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Interleukin-6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IL-6 has multiple activities that are probably important in SLE and other rheumatic diseases, including B cell stimulation and induction of acute phase reactants. Serum IL-6 levels in SLE are similar to controls. However, high concentrations of IL-6 are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of lupus patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease, even when the serum levels are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, IL-6 production might be important in CNS lupus, where local cytokine and concomitant immunoglobulin production (including antineuronal antibodies) have pathogenic significance.

It is produced as an inactive latent protein that must be activated by limited proteolysis. The increase in collagen synthesis by fibroblasts exposed to TGF-beta appears to depend, at least in part, upon the induction of another cytokine, connective tissue growth factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>There are several observations suggesting that systemic TGF-beta has antiinflammatory activity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic therapy, either by administration of exogenous protein or using gene therapy, suppresses streptococcal cell arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TGF-beta also has demonstrated utility in other autoimmunity models, including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, collagen-induced arthritis, and diabetes mellitus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animals null for the TGF-beta gene develop systemic autoimmunity and diffuse inflammation in a variety of tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p>By comparison, the local injection of this cytokine into joints of rats induces synovial intimal lining hyperplasia; together, these observations suggest that the consequences of local injection may differ from those of systemic administration.</p><p>TGF-beta production by lymphocytes may be reduced in patients with SLE, possibly contributing to flares of the disease. This was illustrated in a study in which 17 patients with SLE were compared with 17 patients with RA and 23 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Lymphocytes from the patients with SLE, particularly those with very active disease, produced significantly less of the activated form of TGF-beta.</p><p>The functional significance of IL-12, -15, and -18 in SLE is uncertain. A potential functional role for IL-17 has been suggested, though its definitive effects are not yet certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokine networks in animal models of SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal models of SLE are also dependent upon cytokine networks. As an example, NZB and <span class=\"nowrap\">NZB/NZW</span> mice serve as useful models for human SLE. NZB mice develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia with hepatosplenomegaly and occasional immune complex glomerulonephritis, while <span class=\"nowrap\">NZB/NZW</span> mice develop a progressive SLE-like illness marked by fatal immune complex glomerulonephritis accompanied by the production of antinuclear antibodies (including anti-dsDNA antibodies). The data suggest the possibility that overproduction of IFN and underproduction of TNF may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IFN-gamma has been used to treat both strains of mice. The IFN-treated NZB mice develop hemolytic anemia earlier than control mice; in addition, the <span class=\"nowrap\">NZB/NZW</span> strain treated with IFN have a significant increase in renal immune complex deposition, proteinuria, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a separate study, <span class=\"nowrap\">NZB/NZW</span> mice treated with recombinant IFN-gamma developed early renal disease and died earlier than the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In the placebo group, for example, the mean life span was about 9.5 months (with death usually due to renal failure), whereas almost 80 percent of mice in the IFN-gamma treated cohort were dead in less than eight months. Another group of mice treated with monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma had a dramatic decrease in mortality compared with animals treated with an irrelevant antibody or saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal studies also support a correlation between SLE and a TNF-alpha production phenotype. As with humans, mice can be divided into high and low TNF-alpha producers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. High TNF-producing strains are resistant to lupus-like disease, whereas low TNF-producers, like the <span class=\"nowrap\">NZB/NZW</span> strain, are susceptible. This is similar to the observation, mentioned previously, that HLA-DR2-positive SLE patients have a &quot;low TNF&quot; phenotype and tend to develop nephritis. In another study, parenteral administration of TNF-alpha to <span class=\"nowrap\">NZB/NZW</span> mice prior to the onset of nephritis significantly delayed (but did not prevent) proteinuria and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p>These data suggest that TNF-alpha, in contrast to IFN-gamma, might exert a protective effect in SLE. As a result, SLE appears to be an illness in which IFN overproduction and TNF-alpha underproduction might have pathogenetic importance. This contrasts sharply with RA, where defective IFN-gamma production and overproduction of TNF-alpha might play a role. It is of interest in this regard that patients with RA who have been treated with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody have an increased incidence of antinuclear antibodies. It is therefore possible that individuals with an autoimmune diathesis are directed towards SLE in the absence of adequate TNF-alpha production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SCLERODERMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our understanding of cytokine regulation in scleroderma is fairly rudimentary (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>). There is an overabundance of factors that encourage deposition of collagen, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. TGF-beta inhibits production of collagenase and increases collagen production by skin fibroblasts. This growth factor has also been identified in scleroderma skin and lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. TGF-beta might also serve to sensitize dermal fibroblasts to the effects of platelet derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor.</p><p>A variety of other cytokines have been detected in the skin of patients with scleroderma. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, IL-6, and IL-17 are abundant and could be involved in regulating skin fibroblast activation and proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. Some of these factors can also be detected in the serum, including TGF-beta and IL-6. Serum IL-6 levels are especially high in scleroderma and the concentrations correlate with clinical disease activity, but not with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Cultured dermal fibroblasts in scleroderma also constitutively produce much more IL-6 than normal fibroblasts, especially if they are obtained from involved skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In addition, IL-1 appears to be produced in greater amounts by scleroderma fibroblasts. A role for cells of the Th17 lineage has also been suggested. Further studies will be required to examine the hierarchical role of this cytokine axis in disease progression.</p><p>It is not known whether the scleroderma fibroblast is fundamentally different from normal skin fibroblasts or whether it is simply responding to a cytokine milieu that encourages collagen deposition. Some evidence of autonomous growth in the absence of serum can be explained by autocrine production of platelet derived growth factor by scleroderma fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

A complex cytokine network is involved in normal immune function, and this network is comprised of positive and negative feedback loops that enhance or suppress the response.

In general, T cell-derived factors are not as prominent as macrophage and fibroblast cytokines in the rheumatoid joint. One exception may be interleukin (IL)-17, a Th17 cell-derived cytokine that exhibits many of the same activities as IL-1 and TNF-alpha.

Dissection of the cytokine network in RA has led to the notion that positive feedback loops contribute to the perpetuation of synovial inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82586\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82586 \">figure 2</a>).
