Patients with CLL have underlying abnormalities in immune function related to the primary disease process in addition to immune defects related to the specific antileukemic therapies administered. The spectrum of infections in CLL patients has evolved with the introduction of therapies such as the purine analogs and monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>).</p><p>The immune defects related to CLL and its therapy as well as the spectrum of infectious complications will be reviewed here.

Therapy-related immunosuppression has further impact on immune function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198496\"><span class=\"h2\">Humoral immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypogammaglobulinemia is the most predominant inherent immune defect in CLL patients, with subtypes IgG3 and IgG4 particularly affected. Hypogammaglobulinemia is related to defective functioning of T cells and non-clonal CD5-negative B cells. Hypogammaglobulinemia becomes more pronounced with longer disease duration and advanced-stage disease. There is generally no reversal in this defect, even with response to therapy. However, in one report, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> therapy resulted in partial reconstitution of humoral immunity, with an increase in IgA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although an association between hypogammaglobulinemia and infection frequency and survival has been demonstrated, there is no consistent correlation between a specific immunoglobulin class deficiency and infection risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>The immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (<em>IgV</em><em><sub>H</sub></em>) gene may be mutated or unmutated in patients with CLL. Patients with unmutated <em>IgV</em><em><sub>H</sub></em> genes tend to have a poorer prognosis than those with mutated <em>IgV</em><em><sub>H</sub></em> genes. The impact of <em>IgV</em><em><sub>H</sub></em> mutational status on humoral immunity and infections has been evaluated, with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In a study that included 33 patients with CLL, there were no significant differences in the levels of immunoglobulins or mannose-binding lectin, immune response to <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b vaccination, or infection rate among patients with mutated versus unmutated <em>IgV</em><em><sub>H</sub></em> gene status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, in a retrospective review of 280 patients with CLL, those with unmutated <em>IgV</em><em><sub>H</sub></em><sub> </sub>genes had a significantly shorter time to first infection (31 versus 62 months) and significantly higher infection-related mortality than patients with mutated <em>IgV</em><em><sub>H</sub></em> genes, although immunoglobulin levels were comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with p53 abnormalities, as well as CD38 positivity, had a significantly shorter time to first infection; ZAP-70 levels had no impact on occurrence.</p><p>The most common site of infection in CLL patients is the respiratory tract, which may be related to serum IgA and IgG4 deficiencies and possibly to mucosal immune defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is not clear if mucosal immunity is regulated independently of systemic immunity or if mucosal B cells are part of the malignant B cell clone. The integrity of mucosal immune function and the relationship between systemic and mucosal immune dysfunction are not well delineated. In a report of serum and mucosal (salivary) immunoglobulin levels measurement in CLL patients, salivary IgM levels were profoundly decreased in hypogammaglobulinemic CLL patients, but no differences were found in salivary IgG or IgA levels among CLL patients versus controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, no correlation between salivary immunoglobulin levels and infection occurrence was found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198502\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell-mediated immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although CLL patients have inherent defects in various parameters of cell-mediated immunity and complement activity, their impact on infection risk has not been examined. These defects may be related to TGF-beta secretion by CLL B cells, which inhibits B cell proliferation, as well as release of circulating interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, which binds endogenous IL-2, resulting in downregulation of T cell function.</p><p>CD8-positive T cells secrete IL-4, which induces bcl-2 protein expression, possibly contributing to CLL pathogenesis and disease progression. As with B cell defects, T cell defects are more pronounced with advanced-stage disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198508\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased levels of at least one component of complement, especially properdin, are found in most patients with CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Defects in complement activation and binding and reduced expression of the complement receptors, CR1 and CR2, on CLL B cells have also been found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198514\"><span class=\"h2\">Innate immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative and qualitative neutrophil and monocyte defects are found in CLL patients. The absolute neutrophil count is normal to slightly decreased in untreated patients. Defects in neutrophil phagocytic and bactericidal activity, including decreased C5a-induced chemotaxis, have been demonstrated, as well as deficiencies in monocyte levels of b-glucuronidase, lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1200223\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum of infections in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients has changed over the past several decades with the introduction of CLL therapies that have specific effects on immune function, particularly on cell-mediated immunity. The infectious complications seen in these patients have evolved in relation to the specific agents used and will be discussed below in relation to the various classes of CLL therapy.</p><p>Treatment-na&iuml;ve patients are at increased risk for bacterial infections caused by common pathogens, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Recurrent bacterial infections with a mucosal origin (respiratory tract, urinary tract) are common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1200229\"><span class=\"h2\">Alkylating agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many years, standard therapy for CLL patients was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> given alone or in combination with glucocorticoids. As in treatment-na&iuml;ve patients, the majority of infections in patients treated with an alkylating agent are bacterial, caused by common pathogens such those described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Recurrent bacterial infections with a mucosal origin (respiratory tract, urinary tract) are common. Fungal and viral infections occur infrequently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82248400\"><span class=\"h2\">Purine analogs</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1200235\"><span class=\"h3\">Fludarabine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the use of purine analogs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>), which result in quantitative and qualitative T cell abnormalities, a wider spectrum of infectious complications has emerged compared with what has been seen with alkylating agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. Inhibition of cytokine-induced activation of STAT-1 and STAT-1&ndash;dependent gene transcription results in decreased peripheral blood T cell counts, which occurs early in treatment and persists for up to two years after discontinuation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A greater impact is seen on CD4+ T cells than CD8+ T cells or NK cells. Decreased B cell and monocyte counts also occur.</p><p>In addition to common bacterial infections, opportunistic infections caused by organisms such as <em>Listeria,</em> mycobacteria, <em>Nocardia, Candida</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Cryptococcus</em>, <em>Pneumocystis</em>, and herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus [HSV], varicella-zoster virus [VZV], and cytomegalovirus [CMV]) have been reported<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. The addition of glucocorticoids to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> increases the risk of these opportunistic infections and is therefore generally avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/9,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,14</a>]. HSV and VZV infections, the majority being localized infections, are more common in patients receiving single-agent fludarabine than in those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Infections are most common during the first several cycles of therapy and are relatively uncommon after discontinuation of therapy in responding patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Risk factors for infection in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> include poor therapeutic response, advanced disease stage, receipt of prior CLL therapy, elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/9-11,14,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,14,16-18</a>]. In a trial in which patients received initial CLL therapy with fludarabine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, or both agents, a low baseline IgG level was a risk factor for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Advanced age and a decreased creatinine clearance were risk factors only in patients receiving both agents. No association between infection and response to therapy or advanced-stage disease was observed. In a large retrospective review, risk factors for major infections identified on multivariate analysis included the number of prior regimens (risk ratio [RR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-8.0) and hemoglobin &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Age and renal function had no impact on infection risk.</p><p>The risk and spectrum of infection in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> compared with conventional regimens based on alkylating agents have been examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19,20</a>]. In one trial, patients receiving fludarabine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> had significantly more infections than those receiving either agent alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Those receiving fludarabine alone had more major infections and herpesvirus infections compared with patients treated with chlorambucil alone. Only three <em>Pneumocystis</em> infections and no <em>Aspergillus</em> infections were observed. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of single-agent fludarabine or alkylating agent-based therapy trials, grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4</span> (severe) infections were more common with fludarabine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Infections with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide combination therapy have also been evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In a randomized intergroup trial of initial CLL therapy with this combination plus myeloid growth factor support and antiviral prophylaxis or single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, infection rates less than 10 percent were reported in both arms; all patients received <em>Pneumocystis</em> prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The German CLL Study Group studied first-line fludarabine-cyclophosphamide therapy in a phase II trial as well as in a randomized trial in younger CLL patients, comparing it with single-agent fludarabine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In the latter trial, the occurrence of severe and opportunistic infections was comparable (fludarabine 33 percent; fludarabine-cyclophosphamide 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, dose reductions due to myelosuppression were more common with the combination, which may have impacted the infection rate.</p><p>The addition of oblimersen, a bcl-2 antisense agent, to fludarabine-cyclophosphamide does not increase the risk of opportunistic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In previously treated patients, 57 percent receiving fludarabine-cyclophosphamide had infections or fever of unknown origin, including 26 percent caused by herpesviruses and 7 percent caused by fungal pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The incidence of infection during the first three cycles of therapy was 74 percent. Epstein-Barr virus&ndash;associated lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported in patients who received fludarabine-cyclophosphamide followed by autologous stem cell transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201378\"><span class=\"h3\">Other purine analogs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a> (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a> (deoxycoformycin) also results in quantitative T cell subset abnormalities that persist for up to one to two years after therapy discontinuation.

Bacterial infections were most common, although cases of herpesvirus infection, toxoplasmosis, and candidal esophagitis were also reported. Opportunistic infections such as disseminated herpes zoster and pulmonary aspergillosis have also been reported in patients with refractory CLL receiving cladribine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In a large series of CLL patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a> alone or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, infections and fever of unknown origin occurred more often in previously treated patients than in treatment-na&iuml;ve patients (49 versus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
