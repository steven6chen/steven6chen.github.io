In 1993, a highly fatal epidemic due to acute hantavirus infection in the American Southwest was associated with the rapid onset of respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The members of the Hantavirus genus (eg, Hantaan, Puumala, Seoul, Dobrava, Sin Nombre, and Andes virus) each produce different forms of clinical disease in humans. As an example, renal disease due to Puumala virus is relatively mild and is associated with a benign long-term prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Sin Nombre virus is the hantavirus found most frequently in the United States, which primarily induces a cardiopulmonary syndrome, as does the Andes virus, found in South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. More severe renal disease can occur with infections by Hantaan and Dobrava virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p>Clinical syndromes caused by hantaviruses have also been known as epidemic hemorrhagic fever, hemorrhagic nephrosonephritis, Songo fever, Korean hemorrhagic fever, and nephropathia epidemica. In an attempt to avoid confusion, these diseases are now collectively referred to by the World Health Organization as &quot;hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome&quot; (HFRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p>Renal disease associated with hantavirus infection will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and diagnosis of hantavirus infections and hantavirus-associated cardiopulmonary syndrome are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-hantavirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and diagnosis of hantavirus infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hantavirus-cardiopulmonary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hantavirus infection is acquired by inhalation of aerosolized virus containing particles or contact with urine, secretions, or feces of infected rodents. Smoking, possibly by altering the conditions of the human airways, is a risk factor for Puumala virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The rodent vectors differ for each viral species but include mice, voles, shrews, and rats. Person-to-person transmission has been reported in Andes virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Infection with hantaviruses is associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, although less than one-fourth of cases have a severe course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. Overall mortality from HFRS varies widely, from 0.5 percent with the milder European forms of the disease to as high as 5 to 10 percent for Korean hemorrhagic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1,6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,11</a>]. Supportive care has had a substantial positive effect upon mortality in this illness. For patients with severe HFRS, for example, mortality rates have decreased from 10 to 15 percent in the 1960s to rates of less than 5 percent with advanced supportive care.</p><p>Many cases have been reported in Europe and Asia, including Scandinavia, the Balkans, and Korea. In addition, the 1999 war in the Balkans was associated with a resurgence of cases, most of which resulted from the exposure of soldiers to rodents in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Multiple areas of the United States may also harbor reservoirs for the Sin Nombre hantavirus. Serologically proven disease due to HFRS strains has been documented in Baltimore due to a heavily infested rodent population, although the attack rate was low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-hantavirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and diagnosis of hantavirus infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF RENAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased vascular permeability appears to play a general role in the pathogenesis of severe hantavirus infection. This is suggested clinically by an increase in hematocrit and a decrease in serum protein levels, and tracer studies have confirmed a generalized vascular leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. The increased permeability may be mediated in part by bradykinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>The complement system is activated in hantavirus infections both via classical and alternate pathways, and there is a relationship between the complement activation and the clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Several molecular mechanisms link the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades with complement components C3 and C5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Additional findings are similar to those of septic shock, including a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of sepsis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hantavirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hantavirus infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An abrupt decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is often observed among patients with hantavirus infection. Intrarenal events play an important role in the development of renal failure in HFRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following contributing factors have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to vascular endothelium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation of tubular and interstitial damage by cytokines and other humoral factors (such as tumor necrosis factor), causing acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. This is corroborated by the increased expression of cytokines in the peritubular areas on histologic specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and by the correlation of urinary excretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) with the amount of proteinuria (eg, severity of damage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Urine-soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels correlate with proteinuria and with the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI), and it is possible that suPAR has a pathogenic role in Puumala hantavirus-induced nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Distal tubular or collecting duct injury is also reflected by increased urinary sediment GATA-3 mRNA levels, which are a risk factor for severe AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic factors may predispose some individuals to the development of severe renal involvement associated with HFRS due to Puumala virus because of an enhanced immune response to the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,30</a>]. As an example, adults with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B8 and DR3 alleles develop AKI requiring dialysis more often than those without these alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]; in contrast, patients with HLA B27 have milder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A similar association between HLA B8 and DR3 and severity of disease has not been noted in children, perhaps because the overall clinical course of Puumala virus infection is milder than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms related to platelet activation, blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis have an impact on kidney function and platelet count in HFRS caused by Puumala virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In addition, many other immunity-related genes and haplotypes are associated with the severity of various human hantavirus infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hantavirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hantavirus infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>However, the exact role of the viral infection is unclear. As an example, although hantaviruses have been shown to infect human endothelial cells using beta3 integrins, they are not necessarily cytotoxic, and similar endothelial cell infection has been documented with many viruses that do not cause severe vascular damage (eg, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, measles virus).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The virus can be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in kidney biopsy material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The most prominent renal histopathologic finding of hantavirus infection is an acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, with the inflammatory infiltrate composed predominantly of mononuclear cells and CD8 lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Other common interstitial changes include congestion and dilatation of the medullary vessels, hemorrhage into the medullary tissues, interstitial edema, and tubular cell necrosis and degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/3,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,38,39</a>], as well as microvascular inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Hantaviruses can infect tubular epithelial cells, glomerular endothelial cells, and podocytes of human kidney and disrupt cell-to-cell contacts in all of these cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

Light microscopy may demonstrate slight mononuclear hypercellularity and mesangial proliferation, and immunohistochemistry may reveal occasional immunoglobulin and complement deposits in the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/3,39,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,39,44,45</a>]. However, mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis shortly after Puumala virus infection has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic HFRS has several prominent features, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1-6,11,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6,11,47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal failure</p><p/><p>The clinical course, however, can be extremely variable, and some infected individual are asymptomatic.

Some patients develop hypotension and severe oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI). Abnormal laboratory values include a leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and slightly elevated liver function tests.

The clinical picture of Dobrava infection is similar, but the symptoms are somewhat more severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/11,47,51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,47,51-55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifestations of HFRS due to Asian strains are more severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. In addition to the findings noted with Puumala virus infection, over one-third of patients are hypotensive; almost two-thirds develop oliguria, many of whom may require dialysis; laboratory abnormalities are more severe; and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can be observed.

An abrupt decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is thought to be related in part to damage to the vascular endothelium and cytokine-induced tubular and interstitial damage. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of renal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The virus can be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in kidney biopsy material. The most prominent renal histopathologic finding of hantavirus infection is an acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, sometimes with interstitial hemorrhage.
