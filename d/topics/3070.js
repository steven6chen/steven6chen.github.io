Gastrointestinal and renal hydrogen loss is usually accompanied by the loss of chloride and potassium, resulting in hypochloremia and hypokalemia.</p><p>Patients with preserved renal function will most often rapidly excrete excess bicarbonate in the urine. Thus, metabolic alkalosis can only persist if the ability to excrete excess bicarbonate in the urine is impaired due to one of the following causes: hypovolemia; reduced effective arterial blood volume (due, for example, to heart failure or cirrhosis); chloride depletion; hypokalemia; reduced glomerular filtration rate; hyperaldosteronism; or combinations of these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p>The causes of metabolic alkalosis will be reviewed here.

These ion fluxes simultaneously increase the plasma bicarbonate concentration and lower the intracellular pH. To the extent that this occurs in renal tubular cells, the ensuing intracellular acidosis promotes hydrogen secretion into the lumen, which results in the addition of bicarbonate to the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Under normal conditions, gastric hydrogen ion secretion does not lead to metabolic alkalosis, since the hydrogen ions are not lost from the body, but instead are neutralized by bicarbonate secreted by the pancreas, liver, and intestines in response to the acid that enters the small bowel. Within the intestinal lumen, the hydrogen and bicarbonate ions combine to form carbonic acid and water, and the secreted chloride, sodium, and potassium ions are reabsorbed into the systemic circulation. When vomiting or nasogastric tube suction removes hydrogen chloride from the body and prevents it from reaching the duodenum, the bicarbonate that is added to the extracellular fluid is not neutralized by the subsequent secretion of bicarbonate into the more distal gastrointestinal lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>The administration of poorly absorbed antacids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-hydroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium hydroxide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>, does not usually generate metabolic alkalosis. Although the hydroxide or carbonate component of the antacid combines with gastric hydrogen ions to generate carbon dioxide and water, the cation component of the antacid (magnesium, aluminum, or calcium) combines with bicarbonate in the more distal gastrointestinal lumen and is excreted in the stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The net effect is that the ingestion of poorly absorbed alkali is matched by a virtually identical excretion of alkali in the stool. However, this may not occur if a patient is treated simultaneously with both a poorly absorbed antacid and a cation-exchange resin such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-polystyrene-sulfonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a>. Usually, this cation-exchange resin releases sodium and binds potassium, but if given with an antacid, the cation-exchanger also binds magnesium, aluminum, or calcium from the antacid in addition to potassium. The sodium released from the cation-exchange resin and the carbonate or hydroxide released from the antacid are systemically absorbed, while the cation-exchange resin is excreted in the stool combined with the magnesium, aluminum, or calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. If the patient has a low glomerular filtration rate, the alkalosis persists because the absorbed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> cannot be rapidly excreted into the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrheal stool typically has a relatively high alkali concentration (the alkali is usually present in the form of potassium and sodium salts of<strong><em> </em></strong>organic anions such as propionate and butyrate, which represent &quot;potential bicarbonate&quot;). As a result, large-volume diarrhea typically generates metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities with diarrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in rare instances, diarrhea can produce metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This may occur in some patients with a villous adenoma and in some who abuse laxatives. The mechanism responsible for the metabolic alkalosis in such patients is not well understood, but hypokalemia is invariably prominent and probably plays a major pathophysiologic role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The concurrent surreptitious use of diuretics as well as surreptitious vomiting may also contribute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious diarrhea: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H37637759\" class=\"local\">'Hypokalemia'</a> above.)</p><p>Another form of diarrhea that consistently generates metabolic alkalosis is congenital chloride diarrhea, or chloridorrhea, which is due to a genetic mutation in an intestinal chloride-bicarbonate exchanger. This exchanger, which normally reabsorbs chloride and secretes bicarbonate, has several names including the intestinal chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, the solute carrier family 26 member 3 (SLC26A3), chloride diarrhea anion exchanger (CLD), and the downregulated-in-adenoma (DRA) transporter. The diarrheal stool of these patients contains a very high concentration of chloride in contradistinction to all other forms of diarrhea, in which the stool chloride concentration is relatively low.

Because sodium is reabsorbed more readily than luminal anions, its reabsorption generates an electronegative charge in the tubular lumen. The electronegative lumen reduces back-diffusion of secreted hydrogen ions from the lumen into the tubular cells and also increases distal tubule hydrogen and potassium secretion, resulting in hypokalemia and total body potassium depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary mineralocorticoid excess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any cause of primary and inappropriate hypersecretion of mineralocorticoids (independent of the volume status) can lead to metabolic alkalosis, which is generally accompanied by hypertension and hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, patients with secondary hyperaldosteronism due to reduced effective arterial blood volume (as in hypovolemia, heart failure, or cirrhosis) usually do not develop metabolic alkalosis or hypokalemia. In the absence of diuretic therapy, such patients have avid proximal tubule sodium reabsorption that markedly reduces distal sodium delivery and tubular flow rates. When distal delivery of sodium and water are low, even high levels of aldosterone cannot generate a large amount of distal sodium reabsorption or potassium and hydrogen ion secretion. However, administration of loop or thiazide diuretics to patients with secondary hyperaldosteronism will increase distal sodium delivery and tubular flow, which then combines with high aldosterone levels to generate marked metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia.</p><p>The combination of high mineralocorticoid levels and generous distal sodium and water delivery only occurs with primary hypersecretion of mineralocorticoids, those<strong><em> </em></strong>disorders that mimic primary hyperaldosteronism (such as Liddle's syndrome), or the combination of secondary mineralocorticoid secretion plus a diuretic whose site of action is proximal to the site of hydrogen ion secretion.

These disorders are produced by genetic defects in ion transporters. The defect in Bartter syndrome impairs sodium chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle and mimics the action of a persistent loop diuretic effect. Gitelman syndrome impairs sodium chloride reabsorption in the &quot;diluting segment&quot; of the distal tubule and mimics the action of a persistent thiazide diuretic effect.

It also probably plays an important role in the secretion of bicarbonate to prevent or reverse the development of metabolic alkaloses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in the reduced activity of pendrin. Under normal conditions, patients with Pendred syndrome do not exhibit any electrolyte disturbances. However, if treated with a thiazide diuretic that inhibits NCC, severe hypovolemia and metabolic alkalosis develop. Due to the importance of pendrin for<strong><em> </em></strong>iodide transport in the thyroid gland and electrolyte homeostasis in the inner ear, patients with Pendred syndrome also have sensorineural hearing loss and hypothyroidism with goiter.

A detailed discussion of metabolic and respiratory compensation in simple and mixed acid-base disorders is presented elsewhere.

Reduction of the PCO2 with a persistently elevated bicarbonate concentration results in a form of metabolic alkalosis that is called &quot;posthypercapnic&quot; metabolic alkalosis.

However, calcium supplements (with or without vitamin D) have replaced milk as the calcium source in most patients with this syndrome. Many patients with the syndrome also have vomiting, which, in addition to the exogenous alkali, contributes to the generation of metabolic alkalosis. The bicarbonate cannot be excreted because of hypovolemia, reduced glomerular filtration rate (which results from both hypovolemia and hypercalcemia), and the hypercalcemia itself (which promotes hydrogen ion secretion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Alkalosis also enhances renal calcium reabsorption, thereby exacerbating the hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The pathophysiology of the milk (or calcium)-alkali syndrome is presented in detail separately.

It is therefore difficult to produce more than a modest increase in plasma bicarbonate by chronically administering alkali to normal individuals. In one study, for example, administration of between 1000 to 1400 mEq per day to a 70 kg individual (a very large quantity) for as long as two to three weeks only raised the serum bicarbonate concentration to a maximum of 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> because most of the ingested sodium bicarbonate was rapidly eliminated in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Although more pronounced metabolic alkalosis can occur if large quantities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> (or sodium salts of organic anions that are metabolized to bicarbonate such as lactate, citrate, or acetate) are given over a short period of time, this usually requires the simultaneous existence or development of hypovolemia, reduced effective arterial blood volume, or renal impairment.</p><p>Examples of metabolic alkalosis induced by alkali administration include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> to treat lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis may produce a postcorrection metabolic alkalosis.

The plasma bicarbonate concentration rises in this setting because there is contraction of the extracellular volume around a relatively constant quantity of extracellular bicarbonate (and the chloride concentration simultaneously falls). The degree to which this occurs is offset by the release of hydrogen ions from cell buffers, which acts to stabilize the plasma bicarbonate concentration at its baseline level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>As an example, administration of intravenous loop diuretics to induce rapid fluid removal in a markedly edematous patient often generates a metabolic alkalosis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H3479576\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Congenital chloride diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p>Although contraction of the extracellular volume can, by itself, theoretically raise the serum bicarbonate, the pathophysiology of the alkalosis in disorders associated with a contraction alkalosis is always multifactorial and complicated. In addition to contraction alkalosis, such patients often have renal bicarbonate generation due to elevated aldosterone levels, combined with generous distal tubule salt and water delivery. Hypokalemia also frequently contributes to accelerated renal bicarbonate generation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduced renal bicarbonate excretory capacity. The glomerular filtration rate is almost invariably reduced, and this also restricts the ability to excrete bicarbonate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1889224811\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-fluid-and-electrolyte-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Fluid and electrolyte disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3160990\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic alkalosis, which produces an elevation of the serum bicarbonate, is a relatively frequent clinical problem that is most commonly generated by excess loss of hydrogen ions from the gastrointestinal tract or in the urine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by hydrogen ion movement into cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57489\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57489 \">table 1</a>). An increased serum bicarbonate concentration may also result from alkali administration or extracellular fluid volume contraction around a relatively constant amount of extracellular bicarbonate (called a &quot;contraction alkalosis&quot;). Most patients with preserved renal function and normal volume status will rapidly excrete excess bicarbonate in the urine. Thus, for metabolic alkalosis to persist, there must be a reduction in the kidney's ability to excrete the excess bicarbonate into the urine. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic alkalosis can result from the shift of hydrogen ions into cells. This most often occurs in patients with hypokalemia and potassium deficits. (See <a href=\"#H37637727\" class=\"local\">'Intracellular shift of hydrogen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal hydrogen loss can result from the removal of gastric secretions (vomiting or nasogastric suction) or, rarely, from the loss of acid-rich stool as in congenital chloridorrhea and villous adenoma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal hydrogen loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in renal acid excretion is usually due to sodium and water delivery to the distal nephron combined with increased mineralocorticoid activity. This occurs with primary mineralocorticoid excess, use of loop or thiazide diuretics, Bartter and Gitelman syndromes, and, to a lesser extent, with hypercalcemia due to the milk (or calcium)-alkali syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Excessive renal hydrogen loss'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Primary mineralocorticoid excess'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Loop or thiazide diuretics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H535878776\" class=\"local\">'Bartter and Gitelman syndromes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hypercalcemia and the milk (or calcium)-alkali syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with Pendred syndrome may develop severe metabolic alkalosis if treated with a thiazide diuretic. (See <a href=\"#H464249450\" class=\"local\">'Pendred syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic respiratory acidosis should generate an appropriate increase in renal hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption. The ensuing increase in the plasma bicarbonate concentration will raise the arterial pH toward normal. If the chronically elevated PCO2 is rapidly lowered, usually by mechanical ventilation, the plasma bicarbonate concentration may remain elevated, producing a posthypercapnic alkalosis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Posthypercapnic alkalosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alkali loads administered to a patient with an impaired renal capacity to excrete the bicarbonate (due to low effective arterial blood volume, chloride depletion, hypokalemia, or intrinsic renal disease) may produce metabolic alkalosis. The rapid administration of large alkali loads can cause short-term metabolic alkalosis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Alkali administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A contraction alkalosis occurs when there is loss of large volumes of fluids containing high concentrations of sodium chloride but relatively low concentrations of bicarbonate. The plasma bicarbonate concentration rises in this setting because there is contraction of the extracellular volume around a relatively constant quantity of extracellular bicarbonate. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Contraction alkalosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rose BD, Post TW.
