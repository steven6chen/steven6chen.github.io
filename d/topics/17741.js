(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic autonomic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy will be reviewed here. There are three main elements in the treatment regimen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycemic control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GLYCEMIC CONTROL FOR ESTABLISHED NEUROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal glucose control is important for the prevention of diabetic neuropathy, at least in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a>). In the longitudinal follow-up in the large Diabetes Control and Complications <span class=\"nowrap\">Trial/Epidemiology</span> of Diabetes Interventions and Complications <span class=\"nowrap\">(DCCT/EDIC)</span> trial of type 1 patients, glucose control ameliorated the onset of neuropathy as well as progression of surrogate electrophysiologic markers of neuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70945 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A practice statement issued by the American Diabetes Association in 2005 recommended that the first step in the management of patients with symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy should be to aim for stable and optimal glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a 2012 systematic review, enhanced glucose control led to statistically significant improvements in surrogate measures of neuropathy, including nerve conduction velocity and vibration perception thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These data support the possibility of symptomatic improvement. In addition, clinical experience suggests that vigorous glycemic control is associated with improvement in symptoms for patients who develop acute painful diabetic neuropathy after a period of extreme hyperglycemia such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Nevertheless, established symptomatic diabetic neuropathy is generally not reversible even with intensive glucose control, emphasizing the importance of prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Findings from a small observational study suggest but do not establish that surgical treatment (ie, gastric bypass) of obese patients with type 2 diabetes can lead to short-term improvement in both glycemic control and diabetic neuropathy symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Data from larger and more rigorous studies are necessary to determine whether this approach provides long-term benefit for patients with obesity-related type 2 diabetes and neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOT CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We combine good glucose control with foot care. On a daily basis, patients need to inspect their feet for the presence of dry or cracking skin, fissures, plantar callus formation, and signs of early infection between the toes and around the toe nails. Regular foot examinations by the physician to detect early neuropathy are also an essential component of the treatment of diabetic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once a patient has diabetic neuropathy, foot care is even more important to prevent ulceration, infection, and amputation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of diabetic foot ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PAINFUL DIABETIC NEUROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a small fraction of patients with diabetic polyneuropathy have painful symptoms. Patients with painful diabetic neuropathy should be treated with a systematic, stepwise approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Before initiating therapy, it is important to confirm that the pain is due to neuropathy. The diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The onset of severe pain in the feet and lower limbs can be very distressing and disabling. A disc lesion should be considered if the pain has developed in relation to recent trauma or its onset is abrupt. In addition, pain due to disc disease is more often unilateral than pain related to peripheral neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of these features, the differential diagnosis is neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease. The physical examination may be helpful (decreased sensation or loss of deep tendon reflexes), but these signs of neuropathy do not necessarily mean that the pain is due to the neuropathy. Several clues that the patient has neuropathic pain are the location of pain (feet more than calves), the quality of the pain, and the timing of pain (present at rest, improves with walking) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72373 \">table 1</a>). Each of these features is different from those of the pain due to ischemic vascular disease.</p><p>Although uncommon compared with symmetric diabetic polyneuropathy, there are several other types of acute painful diabetic neuropathy syndromes. These are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment-induced neuropathy of diabetes that presents in the setting of rapid glycemic control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic neuropathy that occurs in the setting of unintended severe weight loss (diabetic neuropathic cachexia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic neuropathy that is seen with intentional weight loss (diabetic anorexia)</p><p/><p>In general, these conditions are characterized by severe neuropathic pain, autonomic dysfunction, and a potentially reversible course that may last for many months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-classification-of-diabetic-neuropathy#H521662378\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and classification of diabetic neuropathy&quot;, section on 'Acute painful diabetic neuropathies'</a>.)</p><p>Finally, diabetic amyotrophy typically occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The traditional features include the acute, asymmetric, focal onset of pain followed by weakness involving the proximal leg, with associated autonomic failure and weight loss. Progression occurs over months and is followed by partial recovery in most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic amyotrophy and idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous resolution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of painful diabetic polyneuropathy is established, the patient should be informed that the condition is sometimes self-limited. In a prospective study of 29 patients, for example, pain remitted within 12 months in 16 patients (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Remission was more likely if the onset of symptoms had followed a sudden metabolic change (either an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis or occasionally an improvement in glycemic control), when the duration of diabetes was relatively short, or when marked weight loss preceded the onset of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for the resolution of pain are not understood. Proposed mechanisms include altered perception of pain, further deterioration of the nerve so that it no longer responds to stimulation (so that the patient is at even greater risk from trauma), or improvement in nerve function. As an example, a neuron may spontaneously fire and cause pain while it is being damaged or while it is recovering. Thus, in a patient who has poor glycemic control, the nerves may be starved of nutrients, leading to acute but reversible nerve injury. On the other hand, a previously silent (anesthetic) nerve may recover during improved glycemic control, leading to spontaneous firing and the perception of pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments that are probably beneficial for painful diabetic neuropathy include a number of antidepressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>), anticonvulsants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Other treatments that may be beneficial include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> patch, alpha-lipoic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide dinitrate</a> topical spray, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The supporting evidence for these interventions is reviewed in the sections that follow, as are guideline recommendations (see <a href=\"#H12039744\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines'</a> below) and our approach to treatment (see <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> below). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H236124\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence from randomized controlled trials that tricyclic drugs (mainly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>) and other antidepressants (mainly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>) are beneficial for reducing pain associated with diabetic neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Tricyclic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several tricyclic antidepressant drugs (but not selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have been found in double-blind, randomized controlled trials to improve symptoms in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Tricyclics may act by altering the central perception of pain. The therapeutic effect usually occurs sooner (within six weeks) and at lower doses than is typical when these drugs are given for the treatment of depression.</p><p>These points are illustrated by the following trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized cross-over trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> were equally effective and superior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The benefit of the tricyclic drugs was noted within two weeks and continued to increase at six weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55889\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55889 \">figure 2</a>). Desipramine had somewhat fewer side effects than amitriptyline, particularly dry mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74923 \">table 2</a>). The average effective dose, titrated over six weeks to achieve control of symptoms, was 111 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for desipramine and 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for amitriptyline. There was no correlation between relief of pain, dosage, or plasma drug concentrations, suggesting that the clinical response and tolerability of side effects are the best guides to dose titration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, blinded cross-over trial of 58 adults with painful diabetic neuropathy that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> (10 to 50 mg daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> (20 to 60 mg daily) given at bed time found a significant improvement in pain with both medications compared with pretreatment baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A good outcome, defined as a median pain score reduction of &gt;50 percent, was reported at a similar rate for amitriptyline and duloxetine (55 versus 59 percent), and the difference was not significant. Dry mouth was significantly more frequent with amitriptyline compared with duloxetine (55 versus 24 percent), while constipation was nonsignificantly more frequent with duloxetine (37 versus 17 percent).</p><p/><p>We use either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> in patients with severe pain.

The benefit of duloxetine was established in three 12-week randomized, blinded, controlled trials involving 1102 subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In these trials, pain improvement occurred significantly more frequently with duloxetine 60 or 120 mg daily than with placebo (47 and 48 percent, versus 29 percent with placebo). Pain improvement was noted as early as the first week of treatment and continued for the duration of the studies. Duloxetine showed rapid onset of action and sustained benefit, and it was also effective in relieving pain at night. The 120 mg daily dose was not as well tolerated as 60 mg daily, although both were beneficial.</p><p>While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> was more effective than placebo, all three trials were of relatively short duration, and the long-term effectiveness and safety of duloxetine is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Furthermore, in clinical trials evaluating painful diabetic polyneuropathy, duloxetine treatment resulted in modest increases in fasting plasma glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although comparative trials are few, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> appears to be as effective as duloxetine for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, and is less expensive. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Tricyclic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p>The most common reported side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> were nausea, somnolence, dizziness, decreased appetite, and constipation. Hot flashes and erectile dysfunction were also reported infrequently.</p><p>Because nausea is common, patients are encouraged to take the drug on a full stomach. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Duloxetine</a> should not be taken with other serotonin or norepinephrine uptake inhibitors but can be combined with anticonvulsant therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H236306\"><span class=\"h3\">Venlafaxine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2015 systematic review of six randomized controlled trials with 460 participants, most having painful diabetic neuropathy, found little compelling evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> is effective for neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. All the included trials showed some benefit for venlafaxine, but all had limitations that could cause an overestimation of effect size. In the largest trial included the systematic review, extended-release (ER) venlafaxine was evaluated in 244 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At six weeks, treatment with ER venlafaxine at higher (150 to 225 mg daily) but not lower (75 mg daily) doses was associated with significant benefit in the primary outcome measures of pain intensity and pain relief compared with placebo. The strength of this finding is limited by the short duration of this trial and by a risk of selection bias due to unclear procedures for randomization and allocation concealment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nausea and somnolence were the most common side effects of venlafaxine, and blood pressure and cardiac rhythm changes occurred more often with venlafaxine treatment than with placebo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticonvulsants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both newer (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>) and older (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>) anticonvulsants may be useful for treating painful diabetic polyneuropathy.
