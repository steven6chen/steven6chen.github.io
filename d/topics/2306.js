Bronchiolitis typically occurs with primary infection or reinfection with a viral pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In young children, the clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis may overlap with recurrent virus-induced wheezing and acute viral-triggered asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For clinical research, bronchiolitis is typically defined as the first episode of wheezing in a child younger than 12 to 24 months who has physical findings of a viral lower respiratory infection and no other explanation for the wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70679837\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiolitis occurs when viruses infect the terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells, causing direct damage and inflammation in the small bronchi and bronchioles. Edema, excessive mucus, and sloughed epithelial cells lead to obstruction of small airways and atelectasis. Based upon biopsy or autopsy samples in severe cases and animal studies, pathologic changes begin 18 to 24 hours after infection and include bronchiolar cell necrosis, ciliary disruption, and peribronchiolar lymphocytic infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiolitis typically is caused by a viral infection. Although the proportion of disease caused by specific viruses varies depending upon the season and the year, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause, followed by rhinovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Less common causes include parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and human bocavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,14,15</a>]. With molecular diagnostics, a viral etiology can be identified in &gt;95 percent of cases; two or more viruses are detected in approximately one-third of young children hospitalized with bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16-18</a>]. In addition, lower respiratory tract infection and wheezing episodes in infants infrequently are associated with <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </em>and<em> Bordetella pertussis</em>.

RSV is ubiquitous throughout the world and causes seasonal outbreaks. In temperate climates, late fall and winter epidemics of bronchiolitis usually are linked to RSV. In tropical and semitropical climates, the seasonal outbreaks usually are associated with the rainy season.

There are more than 170 serotypes. Rhinovirus is associated with lower respiratory tract infection in young children and in individuals with chronic pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Dual viral infections are often detected. Rhinovirus is often associated with bronchiolitis in the spring and fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

It often is preceded by a one- to three-day history of upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg, nasal congestion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discharge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Respiratory distress, increased work of breathing, respiratory rate, and oxygenation all can change rapidly with crying, coughing, and agitation. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation can occur under all of these circumstances as well as during sleep when chest wall muscles relax, further narrowing intrathoracic airways.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536689768\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of the illness due to bronchiolitis depends upon age, severity of illness, associated high-risk conditions (eg, prematurity, chronic pulmonary disease), and the causative agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Bronchiolitis usually is a self-limited disease. Most children who do not require hospitalization recover by 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].</p><p>Typical illness with bronchiolitis begins with upper respiratory tract symptoms, followed by lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms on days two to three, which peak on days three to five and then gradually resolve. In a systematic review of four studies including 590 children with bronchiolitis who were seen in outpatient settings and not treated with bronchodilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,48-50</a>], the mean time to resolution of cough ranged from 8 to 15 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Cough resolved in 50 percent of patients within 13 days and in 90 percent within 21 days. In a cohort of 181 children (not included in the systematic review), the median duration of caretaker-reported symptoms was 12 days; approximately 20 percent continued to have symptoms for at least three weeks, and 10 percent had symptoms for at least four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Although discharge criteria vary from center to center, in multicenter studies of children younger than two years hospitalized with bronchiolitis, the median length of stay was two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,52</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiolitis typically is caused by a viral infection. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause followed by rhinovirus; less common causes include parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses, and human bocavirus. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiolitis typically affects infants and children younger than two years, principally during the fall and winter. Risk factors for severe disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications include gestational age &le;36 weeks, age &lt;12 weeks, chronic pulmonary disease, congenital and anatomic defects of the airways, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency, and neurologic disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H70682711\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of infants and young children with suspected bronchiolitis generally requires only history and physical examination. Chest radiographs and laboratory tests are not necessary for diagnosis but may be warranted to evaluate complications, comorbid infections, or other conditions in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H536691725\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiolitis is diagnosed clinically. Characteristic features include a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort (eg, tachypnea, nasal flaring, chest retractions) and wheezing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> crackles in children younger than two years. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H536691881\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H536692098\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe bronchiolitis is indicated by <strong>persistently</strong> increased respiratory effort (tachypnea; nasal flaring; intercostal, subcostal, or suprasternal retractions; accessory muscle use; grunting), hypoxemia, apnea, or acute respiratory failure. Children with severe disease usually require hospitalization for respiratory and fluid support. (See <a href=\"#H70680853\" class=\"local\">'Severity assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention#H91755868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Severe bronchiolitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of bronchiolitis includes recurrent viral-triggered wheezing or recurrent wheezing, pneumonia, foreign body aspiration, chronic pulmonary disease, aspiration pneumonia, congenital heart disease, heart failure, and vascular ring. Clinical features (eg, lack of preceding upper respiratory tract symptoms, witnessed episode of choking, differential aeration, poor growth) may help to distinguish some of these conditions from bronchiolitis; for others, radiographic or laboratory studies may be necessary.
