Another is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Pediatric Asthma Score, which factors in respiratory rate relative to age, oxygen requirement, presence of retractions, breathlessness during speech, and presence of wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

ICU level management of these children entails the administration of glucocorticoids, aggressive bronchodilator therapy, and close monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Mechanical ventilation is reserved for patients with continued progression toward respiratory failure despite maximal medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The need for mechanical ventilation should be considered early in the course of illness. Mechanical ventilation in a child with an asthma exacerbation is always challenging, usually due to airway obstruction and difficulty with exhalation. The best way to avoid intubation is to rapidly escalate the preintubation therapies discussed below in patients with a worsening trajectory indicated by increased work of breathing or carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention. The decision to intubate a patient should be made with great care since tracheal stimulation often worsens the asthma exacerbation and, in some cases, makes the situation worse.</p><p>In many patients who are progressing toward respiratory muscle fatigue, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) can avoid the need for intubation by easing the work of breathing while awaiting the maximal therapeutic effects of pharmacotherapy. NPPV in conjunction with pharmacologic therapy is effective in improving gas exchange in children and adults with asthma. NPPV can be used in school-aged children with relative ease, but light sedation may be required to facilitate tolerance in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may help to avoid endotracheal intubation in select patients who continue to have severe or unabated increased work of breathing while awaiting the maximum therapeutic benefit of pharmacotherapy.

Thus, NPPV may help to avoid endotracheal intubation in select patients who continue to have severe or unabated symptoms after intravenous bronchodilators or while awaiting the maximum therapeutic benefit of pharmacotherapy. NPPV has been used to treat children with respiratory failure from a number of causes, including neuromuscular disorders, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis, and status asthmaticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management/abstract/24-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-36</a>]. The benefits for children with status asthmaticus are thus far favorable, with retrospective and prospective studies documenting clinical improvement in the pediatric emergency department and ICU settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation for acute and impending respiratory failure in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NPPV involves the delivery of positive airway pressure, either as continuous pressure (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) or as mechanically assisted breaths (bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]), without placement of an artificial airway. In most cases, ventilation is delivered via full facial mask. Patients who receive NPPV must be awake and cooperative, have a patent airway, and have spontaneous respirations. Toddlers and small children may require mild sedation to tolerate the mask. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation for acute and impending respiratory failure in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1105465750\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of action of NPPV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NPPV may be useful as a temporizing measure while awaiting the maximal therapeutic benefit of pharmacotherapy and may help patents avoid the need for intubation. Bronchospasm and increased mucus production result in airflow obstruction in the distal airways that cause increased airway resistance and development of long expiratory time constants in lung units. This leads to the development of air trapping and dynamic hyperinflation, also known as auto-PEEP. The development of auto-PEEP necessitates an increase in the work of breathing since a greater negative force must be generated for inspiration to begin in the context of air trapping. NPPV may improve this phenomenon by stenting open collapsing or narrowed airways, thereby allowing for more complete exhalation. This in turn reduces the inspiratory work of breathing. Additionally, the application of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) further unloads the muscles of respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The outcome measures included change in clinical asthma score, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and oxygen requirement. Adjunctive therapies could be employed, at the discretion of the attending clinician, only if patients experienced an increase in their clinical asthma score beyond two hours after enrollment. Rapid and significant improvements in clinical asthma score were reported at each time point studied, although no significant differences between the two groups were seen for the other outcome measures. NPPV was well tolerated, and no major complications were reported.</p><p>In a prospective study, 20 children (median age 4.8 years) admitted to the PICU with acute lower airway obstruction were randomly assigned to two hours of NPPV followed by two hours of standard therapy or to two hours of standard therapy followed by two hours of NPPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
