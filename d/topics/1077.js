More evidence is available on the risk of stroke or thromboembolism in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; also known as HF due to systolic dysfunction or systolic HF) than in those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; also known as diastolic HF). </p><p>A limitation of the available data is that studies have generally not differentiated embolic from thrombotic stroke and thus it has not been determined whether the types of stroke differ in HFrEF versus HFpEF populations.</p><p>The incidence of thromboembolism in patients with HFrEF was evaluated by retrospective analyses of data from large trials, including V-HeFT, SOLVD, SAVE, and SCD-HeFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Thromboembolic events ranged from 1.5 to 2.7 percent per year and stroke rates ranged from 1.2 to 1.8 percent per year in these study populations. Similarly, a systematic review of studies of patients with chronic HFrEF (with study periods largely during the 1980s and 1990s) reported a stroke rate during the first year of HF of 1.8 percent; the risk of stroke was 4.7 with four to five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Clinical factors that may affect these rates such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and antithrombotic therapy were not analyzed in the systematic review.</p><p>More contemporary data come from an analysis of the risk of stroke among patients with chronic HF (most with HFrEF) enrolled in two trials conducted in the 2000s (CORONA and GISSI-HF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The analysis included 9585 patients, 6054 of which did not have AF. Among patients without AF, the rate of stroke was 1.1 percent per year as compared with 1.7 percent among patients with AF.</p><p>Data in patients with HFpEF suggest that the risk of stroke or thromboembolism is similar to that in patients with HFrEF. Among participants in the ACTIVE trials on antiplatelet therapy (not anticoagulation), the risk of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism was similar in patients with HFpEF (4.3 percent per year) and patients with HFrEF (4.4 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, in the CHARM-Preserved study, the risk of stroke was unrelated to left ventricular EF (LVEF; eg, 1.2 percent per year for LVEF &le;22 percent versus 1.5 percent per year for LVEF &gt;52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the I-PRESERVE and CHARM-Preserved studies, the percentage of deaths attributed to stroke (9 and 7 percent, respectively) were similar to or higher than rates seen in studies of patients with HFrEF (3 to 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure as stroke risk factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of HF on the risk of stroke is illustrated by the following community-based observational studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early data on 5184 Framingham Heart Study participants followed for 24 years found that clinical evidence of HF was associated with an increased risk of stroke.
