The resorption and reformation of bone is important for repair of microfractures and to allow modification of structure in response to stress and other biomechanical forces. Bone formation is normally tightly coupled to bone resorption, so that bone mass does not change. Bone diseases occur when formation and resorption are uncoupled.</p><p>Several assays are available that measure bone turnover markers (BTMs). These assays measure collagen breakdown products and other molecules released from osteoclasts and osteoblasts during the process of bone resorption and formation. Markers that are specific to bone formation include bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), osteocalcin, and N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP); markers specific to bone resorption include N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), and pyridinoline cross-links (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87760 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The use of BTMs in clinical trials has been helpful in understanding the mechanism of action of therapeutic agents. However, their role in the care of individual patients is not well established. Biologic and laboratory variability in BTM values has confounded their widespread use in clinical practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77322\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77322 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>This topic will review issues surrounding the clinical use of biochemical BTMs. The physiology of BTMs, their relationship to the process of bone remodelling, and their use in other bone disorders are reviewed separately.

These issues have confounded their widespread use in clinical practice. However, some clinical assays are now automated. In 2012, the National Bone Health Alliance (NBHA) initiated a project to standardize BTM sample collection procedures in the United States and to establish a reference range of serum N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP, bone formation) and serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX, bone resorption), which are the markers that they, the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF), and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) identified as most promising for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This project is ongoing.</p><p>In the interim, if biochemical BTMs are used in clinical practice (eg, to monitor osteoporosis therapy), we suggest using BTMs that can be measured using automated technology and that have relatively small spontaneous variability, such as serum PINP, CTX, or urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) is also an option in patients without severe liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Baseline and posttreatment serum samples should be obtained under standardized conditions (fasting morning sample) and sent to the same lab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. Urinary collections should also be standardized (fasting second morning void is most common). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response'</a> below.)</p><p>Each of the BTMs demonstrates different responses to treatment, such that the anticipated reduction varies for each marker. For an observed change in BTM to be clinically meaningful, it must exceed the least significant change, defined as a change that is 2.8 times the precision error for the assay. For urinary excretion of NTX, an approximately 50 percent decline is predictive of improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. For serum CTX, PINP, and BSAP, a 30 percent decline is similarly predictive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

However, there is no role for BTMs in selecting candidates for bone density testing or for osteoporosis therapy. The decision to measure bone density should be based upon age and the presence of clinical risk factors for fracture. Similarly, the decision to treat patients should be based upon fracture risk assessment using bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Candidates for BMD testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H11555730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Candidates for therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;, section on 'Candidates for therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Bone density measurements at any skeletal site and with a variety of technologies can predict fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, a single measurement indicates only current density, not the anticipated rate of bone loss. Patients with a given bone density who are losing bone more rapidly will have a higher fracture risk.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that BTMs may be useful in populations in predicting rates of bone loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71125\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71125 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>].

However, for individual patients (eg, patients with conditions that might interfere with drug absorption or efficacy or patients who are reluctant to take antiosteoporosis medications regularly), we sometimes measure fasting urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), or serum N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) before and three to six months after starting bisphosphonates or other antiresorptive therapy. A 50 or 30 percent reduction in urinary NTX excretion or serum CTX, respectively, provides evidence of compliance and drug efficacy.

The effect of osteoporosis therapy on BTMs depends upon the mechanism of action of the specific therapy. Antiresorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates, cause a rapid decrease in markers of bone resorption, followed shortly thereafter by a decrease in bone formation markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, anabolic agents, such as recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH), cause a rapid increase in bone formation markers, followed by an increase in markers of bone resorption.</p><p>Several trials have shown an association between the decrease in BTMs after initiation of antiresorptive therapy and long-term antifracture efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/8,11,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,33-36</a>].

In a subsequent analysis of the same data, measurement of a single urine CTX value while taking risedronate was predictive of fracture reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. CTX values less than or equal to the mean for premenopausal women were associated with the lowest fracture risk, and further suppression of turnover did not result in further reduction of fracture risk.</p><p/><p>Thus, a reduction in BTMs after initiation of antiresorptive therapy is associated with a decrease in fracture. However, the optimal threshold for each marker is not well established. Based upon the above trials, a successful reduction in BTMs could be defined as an approximately 50 (urine markers) or 30 (serum markers) percent decline, or as reducing the BTM to within the lower one-half of the reference range for premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/8,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,35</a>].</p><p>This approach (evaluating a reduction in BTMs) is only useful with antiresorptive therapy, not with rhPTH (markers would increase). An increase in markers of bone formation (C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen [PICP] and BSAP) one month after initiation of PTH has been associated with improvement in bone structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>There are no data on long-term outcomes when BTMs are decreased below the reference interval. Some investigators have hypothesized that such oversuppression of bone turnover may interfere with normal repair of microdamage and increased skeletal fragility. This topic is reviewed elsewhere.

In addition, there are occasionally patients with osteoporosis who have difficulty tolerating treatment or are reluctant to take treatment. In this population, measurement of a BTM that shows a value above the upper limits for premenopausal women puts such patients at especially high risk of bone loss and fracture, which might convince the reluctant patient that treatment is especially beneficial for them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients initiating osteoporosis therapy, we do not measure BTMs. We perform a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and spine after two years, and if BMD is stable or improved, less frequent monitoring thereafter. For the subset of patients with conditions that might interfere with drug absorption or efficacy or for patients who are reluctant to take antiosteoporosis medications regularly, we sometimes measure fasting urinary NTX, serum CTX, or serum PINP before and three to six months after starting bisphosphonates or other antiresorptive therapy. A 50 or 30 percent reduction in urinary NTX excretion or serum CTX, respectively, provides evidence of compliance and drug efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/9,10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12,13</a>]; in such patients, therapy should be continued for two years, when bone density can be measured again. Monitoring osteoporosis therapy is reviewed separately.

Assessment of baseline and post-therapy BTMs may be useful for monitoring patients taking osteoporosis therapy for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early change in BTMs following therapy has been shown to be predictive of improvement in BMD and antifracture efficacy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstrating such changes reflects the degree of patient compliance and improves patient persistence with therapy</p><p/><p>However, their role in monitoring osteoporosis therapy relies upon defining the threshold reduction in BTM to attain optimal treatment effects (ie, fracture reduction). Such thresholds are not universally accepted.</p><p>A less than 50 (NTX) or 30 (CTX, PINP) percent reduction may not necessarily indicate treatment failure, since many patients with small changes in turnover have stable BMD on treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, when this occurs, we question the patient about possible noncompliance or poor absorption (often related to an insufficient time interval between drug intake and food ingestion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5117484\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is interest in using BTMs to determine whether or when patients should discontinue bisphosphonates and whether or when they should resume therapy, although there are no data to support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Nevertheless, some clinicians, including the author of this topic, follow BTMs after discontinuing bisphosphonates and restart when the BTM is in the midrange of young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] or more than 20 percent above the mean premenopausal level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. While this approach makes physiological sense, in the absence of supporting evidence, other UpToDate editors do not advocate using BTMs to determine whether to discontinue bisphosphonate therapy or whether or when to restart it.</p><p>There is no consensus on how long to continue bisphosphonate therapy. However, for some patients, stopping therapy after five years may be reasonable as there appears to be a residual benefit on BMD and fracture reduction for up to five years after discontinuation.

They assign risk based upon CTX criteria and recommend withholding invasive dental procedures when the value is below a certain threshold. The CTX threshold was derived from 17 patients who developed ONJ while taking bisphosphonates. However, they did not measure CTX in a control group of unaffected bisphosphonate-treated individuals. Because bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption (which is why they are efficacious in reducing fracture), BTMs, including CTX, are reduced in patients taking bisphosphonates, and the vast majority of these patients do not get ONJ. It is impossible to identify a particular CTX level at which the risk of ONJ increases without also measuring CTX in a large cohort of bisphosphonate-treated individuals without ONJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1990403\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of biochemical markers of bone turnover (BTMs) for managing osteoporosis is not a central component of most osteoporosis guidelines.

However, for individual patients (eg, patients with conditions that might interfere with drug absorption or efficacy or patients who are reluctant to take antiosteoporosis medications regularly), we sometimes measure fasting urinary NTX, serum CTX, or serum PINP before and three to six months after starting bisphosphonates or other antiresorptive therapy. A 50 or 30 percent reduction in urinary NTX excretion or serum CTX, respectively, provides evidence of compliance and drug efficacy.
