Several mechanisms may promote a high fecal excretion of phosphate, including increased intestinal transit and secretions (as seen with chronic diarrhea), intestinal phosphate binding by calcium, magnesium, or aluminum to form insoluble salts (as observed with chronic antacid therapy), or inhibition of intestinal phosphate transport (as occurs with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">niacin</a> therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Inappropriately high phosphate excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary phosphate excretion above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or a FEPO4 above 5 percent is indicative of renal phosphate wasting in patients with hypophosphatemia.

The triad of hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and urinary phosphate wasting is often present in primary hyperparathyroidism. By contrast, hypocalcemia is a major stimulus for hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone in secondary disease. Hypophosphatemia and urinary phosphate wasting in a patient without hypercalcemia should prompt an evaluation for vitamin D deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypercalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Persistent hyperparathyroidism and hypophosphatemia can also occur after successful renal transplantation due both to residual parathyroid hormone hypersecretion by hyperplastic parathyroid glands and to persistently elevated plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived phosphaturic hormone that is markedly elevated in patients with kidney disease.

The Fanconi syndrome is typically accompanied by clinical evidence of other abnormalities in proximal reabsorption, including glucosuria (at a normal plasma glucose concentration), hypouricemia, aminoaciduria, and a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to urinary bicarbonate wasting. Among the major causes of the Fanconi syndrome are cystinosis, Wilson's disease, multiple myeloma (in which filtered light chains are toxic to the proximal tubule), heavy metal toxicity, and medications (particularly nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as tenofovir, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>).

Normally, hypophosphatemia results in stimulation of calcitriol levels, which would tend to raise the serum phosphate by increasing intestinal phosphate absorption and, perhaps, via bone resorption. Thus, the low calcitriol levels produced by oncogenic osteomalacia are counterintuitive.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of hypophosphatemia is often evident from the history. If, however, the diagnosis is not apparent, then measurement of urinary phosphate excretion should be helpful. Phosphate excretion can be measured either from a 24-hour urine collection or by calculation of the fractional excretion of filtered phosphate (FEPO4) from a random urine specimen. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hypophosphatemic patients, daily phosphate excretion should be less than 100 mg and the FEPO4 should be well below 5 percent if the kidney is responding normally and renal phosphate wasting is not the cause of the hypophosphatemia. The differential diagnosis of hypophosphatemia with an appropriately low FEPO4 includes increased cellular uptake and reduced net intestinal absorption. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Low phosphate excretion'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary phosphate excretion above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or a FEPO4 above 5 percent is indicative of renal phosphate wasting in patients with hypophosphatemia. This problem is due either to hyperparathyroidism or to a renal tubular defect, both of which impair proximal phosphate reabsorption by diminishing the activity of the sodium-phosphate cotransporters. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Inappropriately high phosphate excretion'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;, section on 'Increased urinary excretion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of hypophosphatemia rarely occur unless the serum phosphate concentration is less than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. For these reasons, most hypophosphatemic patients will not require therapy other than that aimed at the underlying cause. As an example, vitamin D supplementation is indicated in patients with vitamin D deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with hypophosphatemia and a serum phosphate less than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we suggest phosphate repletion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Even if these patients are not overtly symptomatic, they may have myopathy and weakness that are not clinically apparent. We suggest the following approach (see <a href=\"#H3136520\" class=\"local\">'Phosphate repletion regimens'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In <strong>asymptomatic</strong> patients with a serum phosphate less than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we give oral phosphate therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The treatment of <strong>symptomatic</strong> patients varies with the severity of the hypophosphatemia. We treat with oral phosphate if the serum phosphate is 1.0 to 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.32 to 0.63 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. We treat with intravenous phosphate if the serum phosphate is less than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and switch to oral replacement when the serum phosphate exceeds 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We stop phosphate repletion when the serum phosphate is greater than or equal to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> unless there is an indication for chronic therapy such as persistent urinary phosphate wasting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When oral phosphate is used, the following regimen is a reasonable approach (see <a href=\"#H3136544\" class=\"local\">'Oral dosing'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the serum phosphate is greater than or equal to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> of elemental phosphorus (minimum of 40 mmol and a maximum of 80 mmol) can be given in three to four divided doses over a 24-hour period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the serum phosphate is less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> 1.3 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> of elemental phosphorus (up to a maximum of 100 mmol) can be given in three to four divided doses over a 24-hour period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous phosphate is potentially dangerous since it can precipitate with calcium and produce a variety of adverse effects including hypocalcemia due to binding of calcium, renal failure due to calcium phosphate precipitation in the kidneys, and possibly fatal arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If intravenous therapy is necessary in the patient with severe symptomatic hypophosphatemia or an inability to tolerate oral therapy, we use a dose that depends upon the severity of the hypophosphatemia and the weight of the patient (see <a href=\"#H3136551\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous dosing'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the serum phosphate concentration is greater than or equal to 1.25 (0.40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we give 0.08 to 0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> over six hours (up to a maximum total dose of 30 mmol).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the serum phosphate concentration is less than 1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we give 0.25 to 0.50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> over 8 to 12 hours (up to a maximum total dose of 80 mmol).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum phosphate concentration should be monitored every six hours when intravenous phosphate is given, and the patient should be switched to oral replacement when the serum phosphate concentration reaches 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.
