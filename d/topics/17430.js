People with the disorder have little or no control over their tics. Many people with Tourette syndrome have mild symptoms, but some have more severe ones.</p><p>Most people with Tourette syndrome start showing signs of the disorder before they are 11 years old. In about half of children with Tourette syndrome, the tics go away by the time they turn 18. Tics that continue into adulthood gradually improve over time in many people. But in some people, the tics return later in life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195118\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Tourette syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor tics &ndash; These are tics that involve unusual movements. They can be mild (called &quot;simple motor tics&quot;) or more extreme (called &quot;complex motor tics&quot;). Examples of motor tics include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Briefly making a face as if angry or in pain (called a &quot;grimace&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shrugging the shoulders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Jerking the head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Walking in a strange way</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kicking, jumping, or moving the body in odd ways</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Scratching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Making obscene gestures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vocal tics &ndash; These are tics that involve unusual sounds or words, or phrases that don't make sense or seem odd.

But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you or your child has it by learning about the symptoms. Most people with Tourette syndrome have a normal physical exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195148\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Tourette syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adults with Tourette syndrome don't need medical treatment unless their tics are severe. A person with Tourette syndrome might need treatment if he or she is having problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talking with other people</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attending school or working at a job</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing everyday things such as bathing, dressing, and eating</p><p/><p>A person might also need treatment if the tics are causing pain or injury.</p><p>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Certain medicines used to treat different mental health conditions can lower the number of tics a person has.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin (brand name: Botox) &ndash; This is a medicine that is given by injection. It works by blocking or calming the nerve signals that make the muscles jerk or twitch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Habit reversal training &ndash; This treatment involves working with a therapist who teaches people with Tourette syndrome to recognize when they are about to have a tic. Then, the people train themselves to do a different movement that makes it hard to do the tic. This treatment is not available everywhere.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195163\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I learn more about Tourette syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More information is available online from the Tourette Syndrome Association at <a href=\"http://www.tsa-usa.org/&amp;token=3BJZCvYmVRfRODyrz5bX/FwUsowRvQeh2nfm7sEpVmw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=12138\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.tsa-usa.org</a>.
