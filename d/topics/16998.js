In the United States, CRC accounts for 8 to 9 percent of cancer deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately one in three people diagnosed with CRC dies of this disease within five years after diagnosis. Removal of premalignant adenomas can prevent the cancer, and removal of localized cancer may prevent CRC-related death.</p><p>Multiple screening tests are available to detect precancerous polyps or early-stage cancers of the <span class=\"nowrap\">colon/rectum</span>. Each test has different strengths and weaknesses with regard to sensitivity and specificity, evidence of effectiveness, effect size, convenience, safety, availability, and cost.</p><p>This topic will review characteristics of individual tests used for CRC screening.</p><p>Screening strategies for patients with an average risk for colon cancer and for those with an increased risk, as well as management of patients with colon polyps, are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from adenomatous polyps that progress from small to large (&gt;1.0 cm) polyps and then to cancer. The progression from adenoma to carcinoma is believed to take at least 10 years on average [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], although this estimate is imprecise because adenomas are ordinarily removed when found.</p><p>Most colorectal polyps are either adenomatous or hyperplastic. These cannot be distinguished reliably by gross appearance and therefore biopsy is required for diagnosis. Hyperplastic polyps usually do not progress to cancer.</p><p>Two-thirds of polyps are adenomas. Adenomas are more common in men than women and prevalence increases with age. In an Austrian population of 44,350 participants (average age 61 years) undergoing colonoscopy screening, adenomas were found in 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Large adenomatous polyps (&gt;1.0 cm) are more likely to progress to cancer than smaller ones but are less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some colon cancers arise from non-polypoid adenomas that are flat or depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>The slow transition from polyps to CRC in most patients allows opportunities to prevent cancer by removing polyps and to prevent cancer death by finding and removing early cancers. Multiple tests are available as options for CRC screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F108745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108745 \">table 1</a>), with somewhat varying sensitivities and specificities for detection of polyps and of CRC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116366\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116366 \">table 2</a>). While stool-based tests mostly improve disease prognosis by detecting early stage treatable cancers (and possibly advanced adenomas), endoscopic or radiologic tests that visualize the bowel mucosa have a greater potential to also prevent cancer by detecting polyps that can be removed prior to malignant transformation.</p><p>Older tests, including guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), double-contrast <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema (DCBE), and colonoscopy with direct visualization (optical colonoscopy) have been recommended as screening options for many years. Newer tests, including fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), computed tomography colonography (CTC, formerly &ldquo;virtual colonoscopy&rdquo;), and a panel test for concomitant assessment of both stool DNA (sDNA) and the presence of hemoglobin are also available. Guidelines do not agree on the screening role for CTC, DCBE, and sDNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Patients assigned to screening were asked to follow a high fiber diet for two days with no red meat, vitamin C, or gastric irritant medications and then to submit two specimens from three consecutive stools for guaiac testing. Most stools were rehydrated with distilled water before testing, increasing sensitivity and decreasing specificity. Participants who tested positive underwent a diagnostic evaluation, usually with colonoscopy. The study also reported 30-year follow-up on 33,020 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Over the follow-up period, 70.9 percent of participants had died. Screening reduced mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), although it had no impact on all-cause mortality. Annual screening had a somewhat greater effect than biennial screening (relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.56-0.82 for annual; RR 0.78, CI 0.65-0.93 for biennial) compared with usual care. The CRC mortality reduction was greater in men than in women, and no benefit was observed for women less than 60 years of age. These data reflect a compliant population (90 percent of participants completed at least one stool test, and 83 percent of positive tests were followed up with colonoscopy) and an older gFOBT test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower magnitude of mortality reduction (15 to 18 percent) was reported with other randomized trials of biennial screening with nonrehydrated specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Twenty-year follow-up of a large trial in Nottingham, England, also using non-rehydrated specimens, found a 13 percent decrease in CRC mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Whereas 28 percent of the screened subjects in the Minnesota trial underwent colonoscopy, only 5 percent of the screened subjects in the Nottingham trial had a colonoscopy; the difference in test characteristics (sensitivity) with rehydration likely contributed to the difference in colonoscopy rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials, biennial screening with Hemoccult II, compared with no screening, reduced CRC mortality at 20 years (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98) and at 30 years (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

It is not necessary to avoid oral iron supplements; however, intake of vitamin C should be restricted to &lt;250 mg per day (less than the dose in common multivitamins) for at least three days prior to sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Large doses of vitamin C cause false-negative tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A systematic review found that advice to follow a restrictive diet did not reduce the gFOBT positivity rate, and restrictive diets decreased screening compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Use of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for primary or secondary prevention is increasingly prevalent among people who are in the age range for CRC screening. While aspirin increases the risk for both upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding and could decrease the positive predictive value of guaiac FOBTs for significant colon disease, we do not ask patients to withhold aspirin or other antiplatelet therapy for gFOBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Three consecutive bowel movements should be sampled (applying two samples to a card, using a different card for each bowel movement).</p><p>A single stool specimen obtained during an office rectal examination is not sufficient for screening. In one study, the sensitivity for advanced neoplasia was much lower with a single stool specimen from a rectal exam than with a six-sample home test (5 versus 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Nevertheless, if an office gFOBT is obtained during a rectal examination and found to be positive for blood in an asymptomatic patient, further workup with colonoscopy is indicated.</p><p>Repeat stool testing is not the appropriate follow-up test once a stool test is positive for blood; colonoscopy should be performed.

Several immunochemical tests are commercially available in the United States.</p><p>FIT is considered an option for CRC screening according to many guidelines. For example, annual testing with FIT, alone or in combination with sigmoidoscopy every 10 years, is one of several options for screening for CRC offered in guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In the United States, the Multi-Society Task Force on CRC also recommends FIT over guaiac-based testing, due to improved sensitivity for detection of CRC and better patient adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Sensitivity of Cologuard was not affected by cancer stage or location of the colonic lesion. Specificity was lower for Cologuard than for the FIT (87 versus 95 percent). However, since screening tests are performed at regular intervals, and intervals for performing repeat FIT testing are most likely shorter than for stool DNA testing, results of one round of screening may not represent comparative effectiveness over a period of time. Based on these results, Cologuard was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2014 as a screening test for colorectal carcinoma to be followed, when abnormal, by diagnostic colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699754165\"><span class=\"h3\">Test procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals collect a full stool sample which is submitted in a collection kit to the laboratory for testing.</p><p>The optimal interval between screening fecal DNA tests is unknown, though guidelines recommend testing every three years.

Colonoscopy is used for screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes. It permits examination and treatment in the rectum, colon, and a portion of the terminal ileum.</p><p>Colonoscopy has become the most commonly used screening test for CRC in the United States. It is less commonly used as a primary screening test in other countries. There is a strong biologic basis that colonoscopy, with direct visualization of the colonic mucosa and the ability to biopsy or excise polyps and localized cancers, can prevent CRCs and deaths. The American College of Gastroenterology considers colonoscopy its &quot;preferred&quot; screening test when it is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>], but other expert groups such as the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) simply list it as an option for screening in average-risk adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1840120799\"><span class=\"h3\">Test procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, colonoscopy is usually performed with the patient under conscious sedation, although in other countries it is frequently performed without sedation. Patients who receive conscious sedation for comfort must be accompanied home after the test and should not return directly to their usual activities.</p><p>Bowel preparation for colonoscopy is rigorous; some patients find the preparation worse than the procedure itself. Frail patients may develop dehydration or electrolyte disturbances from the bowel preparation regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults#H760567930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults&quot;, section on 'Special patient populations'</a>.)</p><p>The adequacy of a colonoscopy is dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation and the experience and technique of the colonoscopist, indicated by achieving cecal intubation (visualization of the cecum by notation of landmarks), sufficient withdrawal time to allow careful scrutiny of the full bowel, and overall adenoma detection rates. Detection rates for neoplasms have been found to be significantly higher for clinicians who, on average, took longer than six minutes to withdraw the colonoscope, compared with those whose withdrawal time was less than six minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The risk of developing or dying from an interval cancer, which is detected before the next recommended colonoscopy, was significantly associated with the endoscopist's adenoma detection rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].

Observational studies have found that screening colonoscopy reduces CRC incidence and deaths.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The National Polyp Study (NPS), a study of 2602 patients with polyps in which the colon was cleared of polyps by colonoscopy, showed a large reduction in the risk of developing advanced colorectal lesions (76 to 90 percent) compared with the general population or with patients in other studies who did not have polyps removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Long-term follow-up of the NPS population found that, at an average follow-up of 16 years, there was a 53 percent reduction in CRC mortality (mortality ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.80) in patients who had adenomas removed compared with the expected CRC mortality rate in the general population (based on data from the SEER program) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. CRC mortality in the NPS for the first 10 years following polypectomy was the same for patients found to have adenomatous or non-adenomatous polyps. Although not a randomized trial, this was the first study to strongly indicate a CRC mortality benefit for colonoscopy. The magnitude of the results of this study may not be generalizable to community practice, because NPS colonoscopies were performed by a small number of trained endoscopists and reported rates of CRC following polypectomy were lower for the NPS than reported in other studies. Rates of postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopies (81 percent in the NPS) may also be higher than is observed in the community.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In follow-up of over 22 years of participants in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, HRs for CRC were 0.57 (95% CI 0.45-0.72) after polypectomy and 0.44 (CI 0.38-0.52) after negative colonoscopy, and the HR for death from CRC was 0.32 (CI 0.24-0.45) after screening colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

Although rates of screening colonoscopy were low in both cases and controls (reflecting practice patterns as early as 1996), the rate of screening colonoscopy performed three months to 10 years prior to late-stage cancer diagnosis was lower than for matched controls (2.8 vs 9.0 percent; adjusted OR 0.29 [95% CI 0.15-0.58]). The rate of screening sigmoidoscopy was also lower antecedent to a CRC diagnosis than the rate for matched controls (19.5 versus 34.0 percent; adjusted OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.70). Similarly, a case-control study of patients who died between ages 55 to 90 years found that screening colonoscopy was associated with a 67 percent reduction in death from CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another case-control study, in a population in Germany, reviewed colonoscopy history over the preceding 10 years for 3148 patients with CRC and 3274 controls without CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].

The New York State Health Department had previously approved the first-generation Septin 9 gene assay in 2011 (ColoVantage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. These tests detect Septin 9 DNA, which is hypermethylated in CRC but not in normal colon tissue. The test is intended for average-risk patients who refuse screening by guideline-recommended methods (eg, colonoscopy or fecal occult blood testing [FOBT]). A positive test should be followed up with a colonoscopy.

The assay was positive in 66.7 percent of stage I, 82.6 percent of stage II, 84.1 percent of stage III, and 100 percent of stage 4 cancers. The false-positive rate was 4.7 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seven-gene biomarker test &ndash; </strong>The New York State Department of Health also approved a seven-gene test (ColonSentry) in February 2012 to be used to identify patients at increased risk of CRC in order to target such patients for monitoring to assure compliance with regular colonoscopy. However, it has not been shown that the test can detect early-stage cancers, for which screening would be most effective, and test sensitivity (61 to 82 percent) and specificity (64 to 77 percent) were only fair for CRC at any stage when tested in populations that included a substantial proportion of patients with known CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/131,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">131,132</a>].</p><p/><p>Additional blood tests for gene expression are in development for testing patients unwilling to undergo initial colonoscopy.

However, CRC is a heterogeneous condition with varying rates of progression of premalignant and early malignant conditions. It is not well-known which adenomas would become cancerous or remain indolent. Removal of a premalignant lesion is the standard of practice but requires clinical judgment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Screening rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening with gFOBT has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to reduce the risk of dying from CRC. More sensitive guaiac-based stool blood tests (eg, Hemoccult SENSA) are preferred to older guaiac-based tests. Guidelines do not recommend rehydrating samples for guaiac-based samples prior to testing. The test needs to be repeated yearly and requires good reminder systems to assure adequate adherence to regular screening. Any positive result requires follow-up colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Sensitive gFOBT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) detect fecal blood, but are specific for colon-related occult blood, more sensitive than guaiac tests, and require fewer stool samples. Quantitative fecal immunochemical stool tests (FIT) are available, but, in the United States, results are reported as positive or negative whether the test is quantitative or not. These tests need to be repeated yearly and require good reminder systems to assure adequate adherence to regular screening. FIT can be analyzed using standardized auto-analyzers. Any positive result requires follow-up colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for blood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cologuard is a multiplex stool DNA (MT-sDNA) test that combines DNA markers and an immunochemical test for hemoglobin in the stool. Sensitivity for CRC and advanced neoplasia appears to exceed that for tests that only detect blood in the stool. Testing requires shipping an entire bowel movement, and the recommended frequency of testing is not well-established but is suggested to be every three years. Any positive result requires follow-up colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H240481080\" class=\"local\">'Fecal DNA tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of screening sigmoidoscopy alone or in combination with fecal blood tests in preventing CRC deaths has been shown by randomized controlled trials. Sigmoidoscopy can identify lesions up to the splenic flexure. Sigmoidoscopy is recommended every five years when performed alone or every 10 years when combined with guaiac- or immunochemical FOBT. Patient preparation for the procedure is less than for procedures that examine the entire colon. Colonoscopy is indicated for follow-up of multiple or large adenomas (&ge;1.0 cm) and for adenomas with villous histology. Colonoscopy is not indicated for single, small (&lt;0.6 cm), tubular adenomas. The decision to perform colonoscopy should be individualized for patients with a single tubular adenoma 0.6 to 1.0 cm. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sigmoidoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in preventing CRC deaths is strongly suggested by long-term follow-up data of patients undergoing polypectomy at colonoscopy and by observational studies. The overall reported sensitivity of colonoscopy is over 95 percent for lesions 6 mm or greater. The sensitivity of colonoscopy for detecting adenomas and carcinomas is dependent on the experience and technique of the colonoscopist. Major complications (perforation and major bleeding) occur in about 1 per 1000 colonoscopy procedures, although the rate is likely lower for screening studies. A rigorous bowel preparation is required for an optimal procedure, and conscious sedation may be used. Advantages of colonoscopy as a screening test are that it provides full bowel visualization; allows for diagnostic procedures, if indicated, in a single procedure; and is performed at a 10-year screening interval. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Colonoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography colonography (CTC, formerly &quot;virtual colonoscopy&quot;) involves obtaining multiple, thin-slice CT data and using computers to construct images of the bowel mucosa in two and three dimensions, with other enhancements to assist in interpretation. CTC detects large (&gt;1 cm) polyps about as well as colonoscopy but is less sensitive for the detection of smaller polyps. Abnormal results need to be followed up by optical colonoscopy for excision and tissue diagnosis. The disadvantages of CTC are that it may require a rigorous bowel preparation, find extra-colonic lesions that may be harmless and result in harm from the additional testing and treating, and expose patients to radiation. (See <a href=\"#H1067228974\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography colonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29473172\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Robert H Fletcher, MD, MSc, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p><p>The author, Dr. Chyke Doubeni, is a member of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).&nbsp;This topic review does not necessarily represent the views and policies of the USPSTF.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration, Fitzmaurice C, Dicker D, et al.
